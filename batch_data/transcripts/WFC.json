My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo first quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference. Jim Rowe : Great. Thank you, Regina and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf and our CFO, Tim Sloan will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn our call over to our John Stumpf, Chairman and CEO. John Stumpf : Thank you, Jim and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We earned a record earnings per share of $1.05 in the first quarter, which was our 17th consecutive quarter of EPS growth. Wells Fargo's ability to grow consistently across a variety of economic and interest rate environments demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model and our unwavering focus on our vision of meeting all of our customers' financial needs and helping them succeed financially. Our financial results have strong capital generation and returning more capital to our shareholders has remained a priority. We are extremely pleased that our 2014 capital plan allows us to increase our common stock dividend by 17% subject to Board approval, of course and also increase our common stock repurchases in 2014. We are proud of the fact that we have been able to increase our dividend and share repurchases every year since 2011, while we have continued to grow our capital levels. Let me now highlight our growth during the quarter, compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.9 billion and EPS of the $1.05, both up 14% from a year ago. We had strong and broad-based loan growth, up $28 billion or 4%. Our credit performance continued to improve with total net charge-offs down $594 million or 42% from a year ago and net charge-offs were only 41 basis points of average loans this quarter. Our outstanding deposit franchise continued to generate strong growth with total deposits up $83.8 billion or 8%. We deepened relationships across our company, achieving record retail banking cross sell of 6.17 products per household. Wholesale banking increased cross sell to 7.2 products and wealth brokerage and retirement cross sell was 10.42 products. We remain focused on reducing expenses with our efficiency ratio declining to 57.9%, down 40 basis points from a year ago. We increased our returns, growing return on assets by eight basis points to 1.57% and return on equity by 76 basis points to 14.35%. We continued to generate strong capital growth with our estimated common equity Tier 1 under Basel III advance approach which was over 10%. Our results not only demonstrate the strength of our diversified business model but also the benefit of an improving economy. While economic growth during the first quarter was uneven, economic activity improved later in the quarter, including national auto sales, which reached a seven-year high in March. Employment also increased in March for the 42nd consecutive month, one of the longest periods of sustained growth ever and consumer confidence hit a six year high. The housing recovery remained on track and should benefit from the spring buying season. I am optimistic about future economic growth, because consumers and businesses have continued to improve their financial conditions. Households have reduced their leverage to the lowest level since 2001 and the burden of their financial obligations is lower than at any time since the mid-1980s. Also businesses are well-positioned to hire and invest with ample supplies of cash. As always, Wells Fargo is ready to help all of our customers to meet their financial needs through our diversified product line and financial advice. I want to conclude by highlighting the management changes we announced last week. Dave Hoyt who has been with Wells Fargo for over 32 years is retiring in June. Dave and his exceptional team of leaders have built a wholesale banking business, which is well-positioned for continued growth. Tim Sloan, who you all know has been an excellent d financial and strategic leader for Wells Fargo and had previously spent 22 years in the wholesale banking group and is perfectly suited to continue wholesale banking's commitment to serving customers as he becomes the head of wholesale banking. John Shrewsberry will join me as CFO on our earnings call next quarter, who has deep understanding of our financial and business operations as well as our shareholder expectations through his 20 years of proven leadership including heading Wells Fargo securities, with responsibility for investment banking, capital markets trading and investment research businesses. John will be supported in his new role by a strong and talented finance team. These changes demonstrate the deep bench of high caliber leaders at Wells Fargo, which I believe is the best team in banking. Tim will now provide more details on our first quarter. Tim? Tim Sloan : Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions. Wells Fargo earned a record $5.9 billion in the first quarter, up 5% from the fourth quarter. Our record earnings per share of $1.05 was also up 5% from last quarter. This was our 17th consecutive quarter of earnings per share growth and our 12th consecutive quarter of record EPS, reflecting the benefit of our diversified business model. As John highlighted and as you can see on page three, we had strong year-over-year growth in the fundamental drivers of our business in commercial and consumer loans, deposits, cross sell, credit, expense management, which resulted in growth in net income, capital and earnings per share and produce higher returns on assets and equity. I will highlight the drivers of our growth which create long-term value for our shareholders throughout the call. Page four highlights our revenue diversification, which is once again evenly split between net interest income and non-interest income. The drivers of our fee income, however, can differ depending on the interest rate and economic environment. For example, mortgage originations were 6% of our fee income this quarter, down from 23% a year ago, when the refinance market was strong. Other businesses such as equity investments, brokerage and mortgage servicing contributed more to fee income this quarter demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model. Let me start by highlighting some of the key drivers of our first quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on page five. We had strong linked quarter growth in both loans and deposits. We are especially pleased with this performance since first quarter is generally a seasonally weaker quarter for growth. Loans increased $4.1 billion from the fourth quarter after increasing only $392 million on a linked quarter basis a year ago. Deposits grew by $15.4 billion compared with $7.9 billion on a linked quarter basis a year ago. The improving economy and high quality loan originations continued to benefit credit quality with net charge-offs declining to 41 basis points. Turning to the income statement on page six. Net interest income declined as we expected, reflecting the two fewer days in the quarter and lower income from variable sources. Non-interest income increased in the quarter, reflecting higher retail brokerage asset-based fees, mortgage servicing income and market sensitive revenue. This growth was partially offset by seasonally lower deposit service charges and card fees and lower mortgage production revenue. Our expenses declined from the fourth quarter. While we had seasonally higher personnel expenses, we had lower deferred compensation expense, salary expense and revenue-based incentive compensation. Equipment, professional services and advertising expenses, all declined from elevated levels in the fourth quarter. Our results this quarter included a $423 million discreet tax benefit primarily from a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the resolution of prior period matters with state taxing authorities. This lowered our income tax expense by $227 million compared with last quarter and reduced our effective income tax rate to 27.9%. Let me now cover our business drivers in more detail. As shown on page seven, we continued to have strong loan growth in the first quarter, our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Period end loans were up $28 billion or 4% from a year ago. Our liquidating portfolio continued to decline, down $12.8 billion from a year ago and down $2.9 billion from the fourth quarter. Excluding our liquidating portfolio, our core portfolio grew by $40.8 billion or 6% from a year ago and was up $7 billion from the fourth quarter. On page eight, we highlight how broad-based our loan growth continued to be. C&I loans were up $12.7 billion or 7% from a year ago as we successfully grew loans in asset-backed finance, corporate banking and government and institutional banking. Foreign loans grew $7.2 billion or 18% from a year ago, reflecting growth in trade finance and the U.K. CRE acquisition we completed in the third quarter. Real estate 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $7.2 billion or 3% with growth in high quality nonconforming mortgages. Auto loans were up $5.3 billion or 11%, reflecting increased auto sales and record originations. Credit card balances were up $1.9 billion or 8%, with record new account growth. Deposit growth also remained strong in the first quarter with average deposits growing $91.1 billion or 9% from a year ago and up $16.9 billion from the fourth quarter. This increase reflected solid growth across our businesses, particularly our consumer businesses and an increase in liquidity related term deposits. Primary consumer checking customers were up 5.1% from a year ago, up from 4.7% in the fourth quarter. We have steadily increased the growth rate of this higher cross sell more profitable customer base over the past four quarters through product enhancements and consistent focus. As shown on page 10, tax-equivalent net interest income increased $157 million from a year ago, even though our net interest margin declined 29 basis points, reflecting the benefit of lower funding costs. Net interest income declined from the fourth quarter as expected, primarily from two fewer days in the quarter and lower variable income. Our net interest margin declined by seven basis points from the fourth quarter to 3.2% driven by three primary factors. Lower income from variable sources reflecting lower PCI resolutions reduced the NIM by four basis points, customer driven deposit growth reduced the NIM by two basis points and the liquidity actions that we took in the fourth quarter in response to increased regulatory liquidity expectations reduced the margin by one basis point. While our deposit growth and liquidity actions reduced our NIM, they had minimal impact on net interest income. Like last quarter balance sheet repricing and growth did not impact the net interest margin this quarter. Growing net interest income remains our focus and we believe we should be able to grow net interest income throughout the remainder of the year. Non-interest income increased $148 million from the fourth quarter with lower mortgage origination revenue offset by stronger equity gains, mortgage servicing revenue and brokerage fees. Compared with a year ago, non-interest income declined $750 million primarily reflecting lower mortgage banking results. Non-interest income excluding mortgage banking was up $534 million from a year ago with growth across many of our businesses, including brokerage, trust and investment management, credit and debit card, commercial real estate brokerage and equity investments. Our equity gains have steadily increased over the past year, reflecting good operating performance in our portfolio and the benefit of strong public and private equity markets. We have been in equity related businesses for over 50 years. Like the other businesses at Wells Fargo, these businesses which are permitted under the Volcker Rule have experienced management teams that have produced strong results for decades. Our equity gains this quarter reflected roughly the same number of transactions as last quarter but our gains per investment were higher benefiting from positive market conditions. Our mortgage results in the first quarter reflected the expected decline in origination volume. We originated $36 billion of mortgages down $14 billion from the fourth quarter. Our unclosed pipeline increased to $27 billion at the end of the quarter and we expect a normal seasonal benefit of a stronger purchase market in the second quarter to drive origination growth. Our gain on sale margin was 1.61% in the first quarter within the range of the margins we saw in the second half of 2013. We also continue to see improvement in our net servicing results where servicing revenue up $229 million from the fourth quarter. As shown on page 12, expenses were down $137 million from the fourth quarter and down $452 million or 4% from a year ago. We also improved our efficiency ratio to 57.9%. Our first quarter expenses included $440 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as $221 million in annual equity rewards for retirement eligible team members. While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense reflecting day count and the impact of our annual merit increases and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter, such as outside professional services and advertising expenses are expected to increase in the second quarter. We also plan to continue to invest in our businesses and revenue-based incentive compensation expense could increase as businesses grow. However, we expect our efficiency ratio to remain within our target range of 55% to 59% in the second quarter. Turning to our business segments, starting on page 13. Community banking earned $3.8 billion in the first quarter, up 31% from a year ago and up 19% from the fourth quarter. Retail banking continued to grow cross sell, achieving a record of 6.17 products per household, up from 6.1 products a year ago, while mobile banking continued to be our fastest-growing channel with 12.5 million active mobile customers up 23% from a year ago. Store traffic has remained strong with teller transaction stable from a year ago, despite decreases in geographies that experienced severe winter weather during the quarter. Our credit card business grew balances and fee income compared with a year ago, reflecting record new account growth up 6% from the first quarter of 2013. Purchase volume grew 14% from a year ago and household penetration increased to 38%, up from 34% a year ago. We continue to be the number one auto lender in the country, with record originations in the first quarter of $7.8 billion, up 15% from a year ago. Wholesale banking earned $1.7 billion in the first quarter, down 15% from a year ago and down 17% from the fourth quarter. This decline was primarily driven by lower PCI resolutions and investment banking revenue and seasonally higher expenses. Wholesale banking continued to generate strong loan growth, up 7% from a year ago and up 2% from the fourth quarter. The linked quarter growth was broad-based with corporate banking growing $2 billion from new loan growth and higher utilization rates from our energy and large corporate and institutional customers. The asset-backed finance portfolio increased $2 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily due to higher utilization rates on warehouse lines and the commercial real estate portfolio grew $1.8 billion from the fourth quarter driven by higher utilization rates on construction loans and new loan originations. Credit quality remained exceptional with $59 million in net recoveries for the quarter. Wholesale banking has had net recoveries for five consecutive quarters, reflecting our conservative risk discipline and improving market conditions. Cross sell increased to a record 7.2 products per relationship, up from 6.8 a year ago. Treasury management continued to be a key relationship building product with revenue up 4% from a year ago, driven by strong sales growth, growth in commercial card volume and pricing increases. Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $475 million in the first quarter, up 41% from a year ago and down 3% from the fourth quarter. We understand the importance of investing and saving for the future, which is why we are focused on offering our customers sound guidance and advice. Our brokerage advisory assets have grown to $388 billion, up $63 billion or 19% from a year ago. Revenues from advisory assets increased 25% from a year ago and recurring revenues are now 80% of WBR revenues up from 74% a year ago. Wealth brokerage retirement also had strong loan growth with average loans up 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by high quality nonconforming mortgage loans. Turning to page 16. Credit quality continued to improve with first quarter losses down $138 million from the fourth quarter and net charge-offs declining to 41 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only one basis point of average loans and consumer losses declined to 75 basis points. Nonperforming assets have declined for seven consecutive quarters and were down $840 million from the fourth quarter. We had a $500 million reserve release in the quarter and we continue to expect future reserve releases absent the significant deterioration in the economy. We also continue to focus on strong capital generation and believe the most important measure of our capital strength is the estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach, fully phased in, our ratio grew to 10.04%, up 28 basis points from last quarter. Although we repurchased 33.5 million common shares in the first quarter, the amount of shares outstanding at the end of the quarter was up due to annual employee benefit plan issuances. As John mentioned at the beginning of our call, our 2014 capital plan included an increase in share repurchase activity compared with 2013 activity and we expect our share count to decline in the second quarter and throughout 2014 as a result of our anticipated share repurchases. Also during the first quarter, our Board approved an additional 350 million shares in our repurchase authority. Our 2014 capital plan also included a proposed dividend of $0.35 per share for the second quarter, subject to Board approval, an increase of 17% over the $0.30 per share we paid in the first quarter. At our last Investor Day in 2012, we provided a target payout ratio of 50% to 65%. We look forward to revisiting this target at our next Investor Day on May 20 in San Francisco. In summary, our consistent EPS growth reflects the advantages of our diversified model. Our results in the first quarter benefited from good loan growth and good deposit growth, improved credit quality and lower expenses. Our capital levels continued to grow, while we returned to $2.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are optimistic that the continued improvement in the economy and the focus of our team members on meeting the financial needs of our customers will continue to produce strong results. We will now open up the call for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a couple of questions. One, just on the LCR, I know you mentioned, that the LCR related bills hit the NIM by one basis point in the quarter. So just wanted to get a sense as to how far along you think you are and how much more you need to do to get to either 100% or whatever cushion you are going to run over 100%? Tim Sloan : Sure. Betsy. That's a really good question. You saw us in the third and fourth quarter in particular make a number of decisions where we raised the liquidity in a number of ways to try to anticipate where the domestic LCR would ultimately land. I think the problem that I have got in terms of or a challenge we have in terms of giving a specific answer to the question is we don't know what the final rules look like yet. But rest assured that we think we have adequate liquidity to operate the company and we don't anticipate whatever the final rules are, that it's going to have a material impact on the company. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay, so don't be surprised if we have a couple of more basis points coming out but it's not going to be much more than that. Is that a fair way of thinking about it? Tim Sloan : I wouldn't necessarily equate it to net interest margin. Clearly the impact of our liquidity build this quarter was much less than in the fourth quarter in particular but again it's going to be a function of what the final rules look like and those are in flux right now. But again, I don't believe it's going to have a material impact on the net income of the operations in the company. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Got it, okay and then just secondly on mortgage. The basic question is, how are you thinking about the go-forward from here? You did indicate that weather related was tough in 1Q and we do have a seasonal pick up with purchase activity in 2Q but going in to the year, I think you know the industry was thinking that mortgage originations would be somewhere between the 1.1 and 1.3 in terms of the (inaudible) dollars origination and you have some capacity in your mortgage origination business to potentially take some share in that environment. Do you see that we are going to be a materially lower levels origination for the full-year? Have you adjusted your expenses for that? At this stage I saw you cut back in headcount a little bit in the quarter and maybe if you could speak to what the plans are for that over the next quarter or two? Tim Sloan : Sure. I will jump in and then John may want to follow-up. The first thing is that when you look at our mortgage business, it was it was profitable, both on an origination and the servicing side which we are very pleased with. Mortgage is an important business for Wells Fargo. We have been in it for decades. We have been through cycles. Our mortgage team is poised and ready to take advantage of a stronger selling season. You can see that we entered the quarter with a slightly increased portfolio and pipeline, which we are very excited about but again, when you look at the fundamental drivers of the mortgage business and that is, rate still historically are very low, the affordability index is very attractive and consumer debt is coming down as well as employment continues to increase. So we are optimistic. I don't know what the size of the market will be but I know that our mortgage team is poised and ready to take advantage of opportunities. John, I don't know if you are going to -- John Stumpf : Sure. Yes. I would just add a couple of things to that. We are optimistic. Housing continues to improve. I don't think we will see the percentage increases in values this year that we saw last year but we believe it to be positive. I don't know if this is going to be in the 4% or 5%, which is kind of the consensus but as I travel around the country, there is a lot of enthusiasm about housing. And just because of the mortgage, you know, who knows where the mortgage market will be, there is frankly a lot more cash buyers today, to be honest about it. So housing is better and a bigger share of our origination, say, are purchase money, which is actually a healthy place to be and when you think of the sales force, the team that we have and all referrals coming out of our store channels and other places, this really plays to our wheelhouse. So we are excited about it and weather did have some impact but we are excited about the selling season. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : I guess I am just interested to see how some job cuts in mortgage this first quarter -- John Stumpf : Well, we are all interested in seeing that. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : All right. That's not an indication that you are too optimistic going into year? Tim Sloan : No. We are adjusting. It's a big business and we are always looking at how to get more efficient, of course and making sure that we have the right number of team members but we are ready for whatever comes and if its not as good, we will make adjustments. If its better, we will make adjustments that way. We have been nimble on our feet for decades in that business. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Yes. Okay, thanks. Tim Sloan : Thank you. John Stumpf : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Good morning. Tim Sloan : Hi, Erika. John Stumpf : Hi, Erika. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Thanks much for the clarity on the share count outlook. I do want to pose a question though on the 350 million share repurchase authority that I have been getting from investors. How should we think about the catalyst that will drive the pace at which you use up this authority over the next few years? John Stumpf : So Erika, the way that I would describe it is that and think about it and step back for a second, we returned $11.4 billion to our shareholders last year. We are going to return more than that this year. In terms of the specifics of how that's going to play out on any given day, in a month or within a quarter, we don't have a specific plan in place that we are going to execute but we would tell you that we think our shares are on sale every day and we are going to repurchase more shares this year than we did last year and you are going to see that share count go down in the second quarter, in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Great. John Stumpf : And the reason we can do that is because the earnings of the company. So just think about it. And that's the fundamental driver here. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : And so, as a follow-up to that, you are clearly an earnings machine and you have plenty of excess capital anyway you measure it. I am wondering, John, could you update us on how you are thinking about what potential acquisition opportunities there could be in terms helping enhance particularly some of your fee businesses? John Stumpf : Sure. We don't need to do anything. That's the beauty here but we are always looking at things in an opportunistic way. The biggest capital required acquisitions or the ones that use the most capital are deposit businesses. We are, of course, at a level now where we are ready at the capital overhead. So the things that we look at are, is there a way to enhance wealth brokerage retirement possibly and that would be interesting to us. Portfolio purchases. We announced something with Dillard's recently. So these are the kind of things that we like doing. We like the card business. What were doing, if there can be an add here or there. So I would think of it as bolt-on businesses and not think of it in the way of transformational but again, if we don't do anything that's also fine. Erika Najarian - Bank of America : Great. Thank you for answering my questions. John Stumpf : Thank you, Erika. Tim Sloan : Thank you, Erika. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Hi. Good morning, guys. Couple of quick questions, Tim. One or two nitpicks on net interest income. How much did the day count hurt NII dollars in the first quarter? And then when you say that you think you can grow net interest income for the rest of the year, I assume you mean starting from the 1Q starting point? Is that a good way to read what your comment was there? John Stumpf : John, that's correct. So from the first quarter starting point, we believe that we are going to grow net interest income throughout the year, similar to what we did last year. The impact of a couple of days was somewhere in the $120 million to $130 million range for the quarter. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay and then in terms of investing cash, with rates coming down this quarter, it doesn't look like you did too much deployment this quarter. Could you just comment on that? There was some movement in held-to-maturity investments. It looked like they went up but can you just comment on what happened this quarter on cash deployment? Tim Sloan : Sure. The good news is that the first call in cash department is always for loan growth and you saw good loan growth year-over-year and on a sequential quarter basis. So we were very excited about that. But you are right. Rates have been pretty volatile this quarter. There have been times during the quarter, when they were more attractive from our perspective and we did accelerate some of investments. Most of the purchases that we made in the quarter, which were about $13 billion on a gross basis, were in the held-to-maturity category and we have specifically purchased some more treasuries. Every quarter has a little bit different complexion. You have seen us be more aggressive and you saw us be more aggressive, for example, in the third and fourth quarters of last year. We will continue to invest our excess liquidity in a very appropriate way but you are right, rates are little bit lower than that we find attractive today. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay and then on the volatile sources, where are we on that this quarter? Is there a multi-quarter average or normalish that you could compare whether those volatile sources below average this quarter? Is there any way to contextualize that? Tim Sloan : Well, the variable income, particularly related to PCI resolutions was, I would say, above average in the fourth quarter. This quarter, if there is such an average for a volatile item, which is hard to work, to be honest, is a little bit of a challenge but I would say this quarter is a little bit more typical than what we have seen in other items in the variable category like loan fees and resolutions and things like that. But the fourth quarter was just a little bit higher and this feels a little bit more typical. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay and then can you have any comment on where you are in preparations for the OLA? I know the rules aren't finished yet but is there any quantification of available bail-in resources or what level of potential requirement you might be preparing for to help us think how far along you are? Tim Sloan : Sure. Again, it's similar to the LCR question and that is, we don't know what the final rules look like yet. We are hearing the same things that you probably are, that its going to be based on the required level of Tier 1 common equity here in the U.S. and then some sort of metric that is going to be reflective of risk in the underlying companies. I mean, the good news is that our business model is a little bit less risky than others and that I think should benefit us. Based upon what we are hearing, we don't anticipate any significant changes in the level of our long-term debt but having said that, I don't know what the final rules are going to be. My understanding is that they could be released sometime this quarter, could be next quarter. We will adjust. I wouldn't anticipate it having a material impact on the operations of the company. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay and then last thing for me. Just on reserve releases, can you give us underneath the service, what's driving the reserve release in terms of categories? I assume there is not much that you are releasing out of the commercial book anymore. Is it really, to the extent you see further reserve releases, is it coming out of mortgage and home equity? John Stumpf : I would say, John, it's predominantly but not completely consumer driven. You have seen and its just a reflection of the fact that the underlying credit quality of the company continues to improve. When you think about the quality of the loans that we have originated post-crisis, the loan losses, credit quality are very, very good. And so our expectation is that while our loan loss reserve release was down this quarter from the prior quarter and from the prior quarter before that, we do anticipate future releases but its primarily consumer driven. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, great. Thank you. John Stumpf : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Great, thanks. You had alluded to, Tim, before the idea of bolt-on type acquisitions. Is there like a maximum size that you would think about in portfolio acquisitions and if its what used to be thought of as a specialty finance business but has perhaps like internet based deposits, does that qualify as a bank? Does that restrict you? How do you think about those two questions, as it relates to the acquisition possibilities? Tim Sloan : Moshe, I don't think there would be any difference in how we review internet-based deposits versus more traditional deposits. Deposits are going to be viewed as deposits. And as John mentioned, it's not a business that we can buy. Clearly we have adequate capital to run our business and excess capital, which we primarily want to return to our shareholders. So we have the capacity to do a relatively large acquisition. However, our focus is going to continue to be on running the business. As John said, we don't really need to do an acquisition to continue to grow. If you look at some of the sizes of the acquisitions that we have done over the last few years, the largest have been portfolio acquisitions. I think the largest was $4 billion, $4.5 billion. So we can clearly do something of that size and really not miss a beat. Could we do something a little bit larger than that? Sure we could but as you know, we are pretty discriminating in terms of what we want to acquire. So I wouldn't anticipate us making any big splash in the near future. John Stumpf : Yes, let me just make sure we are all on the same page here. Tim's absolutely right. Our best opportunity to increase shareholder value is run our existing businesses even better. We have huge opportunity. We have this diversified business model, this culture. 97% of revenues are here in the U.S. It's still a very fragmented market. This is where the opportunity is and we don't need to do anything. If we do, it would be clearly accretive and it would look opportunistic to you and to us but our focus on running the business. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Great and one of the things on the mortgage side that trade press has said a lot about, is that basically a lot of the origination growth has come in the non-banks. Could you talk a little about your strategies just from a market share standpoint given that there has been this growth coming from outside of the traditional banking industry? Tim Sloan : I think it's a fair point. We are not overly concerned about, though obviously we have got to be cognitive of our competition and the reason for that is, we have the best distribution in the entire market. We have number one market share. We have a very experienced team. We have got over 6,200 stores, retail locations plus additional mortgage offices and I don't think anybody is better positioned to take advantage of business and we view it as a core business. We are growing this business. We want to continue to grow the business. We are not concerned about that. So we are going to have competition. We have non-bank competition in every one of our businesses. John, I don't know if you want to -- John Stumpf : Sure half of the U.S. population and half of the businesses in America reside within two miles one of our stores. Just think of that. And while people, a lot of times join us online, they pick the location, they pick the provider that they are familiar with or that's close by them because they still use the store even for the millennials who are very technologically advanced and savvy. So this is really a very important part of what we are doing. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Okay. John Stumpf : So we don't know focus necessary just on share for share's sake. We focus on adding value and meeting the needs of our customers. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Great, just one last nitpicky question. If you look at the yield on the loan portfolio, commercial and commercial mortgage loans, just about $300 billion. It's a pretty sizable drops in the yield. Was that part of the restatement? Was that a PCI thing? Or was there something else going on there? Tim Sloan : Those are mostly related to the decline in the PCI resolution. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Got it, okay. Thank you. John Stumpf : Thank you, Moshe. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : Hi. Good morning, everyone. John Stumpf : Hi, Joe. Tim Sloan : Hi, Joe. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : I just wondered if perhaps you could give us any more clarity on the relative change in the mortgage related production expenses, quarter-to-quarter or sequentially, just based on the cutbacks you announced in the back half of last year? Tim Sloan : Well, they were down. The way that I would think about it, Joe, is that we have been responding to the decline in the refinance activity and we started to do that in the summer and throughout the fall and through the winter. We think we are appropriately staffed right now to take advantage of the spring selling season. And so there will be a little bit of a reduction in terms of the base level of expense because of the changes or the decisions that we made in the first quarter in terms of the number of people, when you think about the second quarter. But we are hopeful, candidly, that the expenses rise in the mortgage business in the second quarter because that's going to be reflective of the fact that originations are up and there will be more incentive-based compensation. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. That makes sense. I guess beyond that, the other question would be just beyond mortgage. Do you see weather having any factor in your loan growth trends this quarter? And I guess, maybe another way of looking at is, how did the pipeline look at quarter-end relative to three months ago? Or how do you see loan growth progressing through the year? Tim Sloan : Loan growth in general or in mortgage, Joe? Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : No, beyond mortgage, other categories. Tim Sloan : The pipelines look good. I think we were really pleased. In the first quarter, $1 billion plus growth on a net basis and $7 billion in the first quarter, that's a really good first quarter, number one, just on an absolute number. The other thing that was exciting from our perspective is how broad-based it was. It wasn't just in any one specific business. It was in our commercial and wholesale businesses. It was in many of our consumer lending businesses and it was in the relationships we have in the wealth, brokerage and retirement business. So it was very broad-based. So we are optimistic about continued loan growth. I don't know what the number is going to be but none of our businesses are saying that they don't think they can grow loans for the rest of the year. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks for the update. Tim Sloan : Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Please go ahead. Chris Mutascio - KBW: Good morning, John and Tim. Good morning. How are you guy doing? John Stumpf : Good. Tim Sloan : Good, Chris. Chris Mutascio - KBW: First, Tim, good luck in your role and if Dave is listening, congratulations on his pending retirement. I am pretty jealous of that. Tim, I wanted to ask you a quick question, actually two quick questions. On the gross servicing, on the mortgage side, on page39 of the release. Before hedging and before any fair value adjustments, you had a pretty good increase, about a 15% increase in the gross servicing income from fourth quarter to first quarter. What would drive such a big increase despite the fact that the portfolio is roughly the same size? Does the lower expenses on foreclosures impact that gross servicing income? Tim Sloan : Yes, it\u2019s a fair point. When you look at that page, you see that our servicing fees were over $1 billion, which was terrific. Now you can look back and see that phenomena in the second quarter of last year too but it's primarily driven by the point you just made Chris and that is that the quality of the portfolios is better and that's a good thing but it's primarily a lack of late charges and special servicing fees and the like. Chris Mutascio - KBW: Okay and just an unrelated question. I am just kind of backing in on the reserve. You have been releasing about 10, well, I don't see releasing but the reserve ratio has been going down about 10 basis points plus or minus for the last couple of quarters per quarter. At that rate, if that were to continue, you would be at a reserve ratio to loans of 1.30%, 1.35% range by end of the year. Is that something that you are comfortable going to in an environment that we are in right now in terms of the regulatory environment? Tim Sloan : Chris, candidly, I didn't appreciate the math that you just described that it's been about 10 basis points a quarter but it has been. It's been accidental more than anything. It's really a function of the underlying improvement in the portfolio. I think that that ratio will continue to improve. I don\u2019t know where, we don't know where it's going to land. It's going to be a function of the performance of the portfolio but it's definitely going to go down. Chris Mutascio - KBW: Okay. Thank you. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Brian Foran - Autonomous: Good morning. I was wondering if I could ask about the Basel III capital and over the past couple of quarters, it's just grown faster than a simple model of earnings less dividend less buybacks and linking RWA growth with asset growth would imply. What's been the main drivers of that? And as we look forward, do you think the Basel III ratio continues to grow faster than that kind of simplistic view would imply? Or is it going to converge with the normal earnings growth rate? Tim Sloan : Well, Brian, it\u2019s a good question. The whole topic is a little bit complicated, primarily because we have had a number of rule changes and rule interpretations by the entire industry, number one. If you recall in the third quarter, we did reduce our RWA and we called out some specific items in the third quarter to reduce our risk-weighted assets but I think the trend in terms of being different than just a basic math that you just described, it's more likely that it's going to closer to the basic math than you just described than not. Candidly it will continue to be a function of the underlying risk within the portfolio. That is the primary driver. If we can continue to improve credit quality, continue to improve market risk, continue to improve operational risk, those will be the big drivers because that's what the new methodology is based upon. Brian Foran - Autonomous: I appreciate that and on the LCR, I know the rules aren't finalized, so all this is kind of prospective as opposed to anything you would be doing now but I guess in a very simplistic level, it seems to raise the value of retail deposits and lower the value of commercial deposits relative to each other just because the retail deposit runoff assumptions are so much lower. How big a deal is that? Is that something that just hit the margin, maybe it fits with the mix of commercial deposits or something or as currently written, is that a bigger deal that actually shifts the focus of industry deposit gathering? Tim Sloan : I don't think it is going to fundamentally shift how we think about gathering deposits. And John, you may have a different view but I mean, anytime we can bring in and broaden a relationship with one of our retail or commercial customers, we want to do that. We want their deposits. What we don't like is our wholesale deposits in the more traditional defined sense or hot money, things like that. We are looking for long-term relationships but even in the most extreme interpretation of the new rules, we still want to grow our commercial deposits. And again that's because we have such a large deposit base. We are not overly concerned about the impact in terms of how it affects the LCR but we will know what the rules look like and the impact, I am sure, later this year. John Stumpf : Brian, Tim is absolutely right. We just love deposits when they are part of a primary relationship and we like them. At times when some were asking us why you are growing deposits because you can't utilize them. And we said, it's good for long-term shareholder value. We have a fixed infrastructure and the more customers we can serve with that fixed infrastructure, magic happens. Not always every quarter and sure we are all looking for earning assets but I will take all the deposits we can get that are part of a primary relationship and we cross-sell off that and it's a major driver in customer loyalty. So it's a big emphasis here for us. Brian Foran - Autonomous: Thank you for taking my questions. John Stumpf : Thank you. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Stumpf : Hi Ken. Tim Sloan : Hi Ken. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: I just wanted to follow-up on the deposit side question. So with you guys sounding pretty confident about the loan pipeline, we are also continuing to see a very strong amount of deposit growth from you guys as well as in the industry and I am just wondering, are there any undercurrents where you are at least starting to see customers use deposits to fund their businesses? Or do you think we are just into a new regime where it's all just about building the relationship and continuing to see deposits grow well as well as grow better. I guess the question is what's different, if anything, as far as how you are seeing loan pipelines grow versus deposit growth continuing? John Stumpf : Let me take a shot at that. You are right. What you typically see, Ken, is when loan start to grow the customers tend to use their own cash first. So there is some of that going on but there's a lot of liquidity in the system. People are saving more. Americans save more now than they did in the last decade or two. And frankly, our the health of our retail delivery system, when I say the health, I mean the online and the stores and the ATMs and the mobile and phone, all of those working together as an omni-channel, is a very compelling value proposition for businesses and consumers and we are getting a disproportionate share. And we just love that. And I will also say this. Our deposit franchise is probably undervalued today given where absolute rates are and that will change over time. The other thing that's happened is we probably have a better set of competitors today than we have had. More rational competitors as in the past. So it's a combination of a lot of things and we are expecting to continue to see strong growth. When I look back at five years ago, when we merged with Wachovia, if you would exclude CDs, we had about $650 billion of deposits. Today if you exclude CDs, we are about at $1.50 trillion. We grew $400 billion dollars in five years. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Yes, great. My second question, just, IB was soft as it was for the industry on a quarter-to-quarter basis and some of that is seasonal but I just wanted to get your comments and your thoughts about market share opportunities and where you think the IB pipeline looks from here? Tim Sloan : We continue to be optimistic about the growth in our investment banking business and the reason for that is that most of the business that we are doing in investment banking is with existing Wells Fargo customers who already have a relationship across the board. So because we haven't penetrated those customers as much as we would like, we still think that there is a lot of opportunity there. The market share is a result of focusing on customers and clients as opposed to trying to get to a specific market share number but you are right. We understand that that business can be a little bit volatile. We were down a bit this quarter. I am hopeful we will be up in the second quarter and the third quarter but as long as we focus on our clients and on the overall relationship, particularly those that are already, we have got a good chance to continue to grow the business. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay and then my last real quick one is just, you mentioned the discrete tax benefit in the first quarter. Can you just to clarify what your expectation is for the tax rate for the rest of the year? Tim Sloan : Sure. The expectation is, it's likely the tax rate is going to go up. I would love to be able to tell you that we could have that kind of tax benefit every quarter but I sure wouldn't plan on it. I think it's more likely that the tax rate for the rest of the quarter, which obviously is going to be very dependent on how much money we earn and we are looking forward to growing revenues and growing income over time but I think it's more likely that that tax rate is going to be in the low 30s. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. Thanks. So kind of back to historical. Okay, got it. Thanks, guys. John Stumpf : Thank you. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Good morning. John Stumpf : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo - CLSA: So, Tim, I am looking at this and thinking what are you leaving your successor, 17 quarters in a row of higher EPS and that's tough to continue. I know I have been asking this several quarters but if you take out I estimate $0.07 benefit due to the lower tax rate, that's a trend that's going to maybe be tough to continue. I don't what's your thought about that. Tim Sloan : Well, Mike, I would love to take credit for 17 quarters of consecutive earnings growth but there's another 264,999 people around here that really get the credit for it. It's not about what we do every quarter. Obviously, we are very proud of not only the last 17 quarters but the last five years where we have grown our earnings on a compounded rate of 16%. So the trend has gone on for a long period of time but every quarter is a little bit different and the second quarter is going to have a different complexion than the first and the fourth and the third of last year but we continue to be optimistic, Mike. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Well, I would ask it a little bit differently. Revenues are down 3% year-over-year and it's good. Now expenses are down 4% and that's helped the efficiency improve from close to 59% down to 58% but that's still on the high end of your target of 55% to 59%. So did you guys not get as much in savings as you would have liked or is that a future opportunity? Tim Sloan : We continue our goal of improving the efficiency of the company. We provided a range of 55% to 59% a couple of years ago and we haven't gotten to the 55% level. That's clearly a goal that we would like to achieve sometime. We think the improvement that we have made year-over-year and on a sequential quarter basis to get back to 57.9% has been very good. But I am hopeful that the primary reason that the dollar expenses could continue to grow in the company is because revenue is going to grow. That's a good thing and that's why we focus on efficiency. So there's still a lot of opportunity in terms of becoming more efficient at Wells Fargo. We are not done yet. Mike Mayo - CLSA: On the expense side, can you just elaborate on a few of the key initiatives that might move that efficiency ratio to the lower end of the range? Tim Sloan : Sure. There's not really any one key efficiency project, Mike. We are a large company. We have lots of different businesses and each business is focused on improving efficiency but for example, we are focused on the amount of space that we have. We have done a great job in terms of reducing the amount of square footage we have in the company but the fact of the matter is our people, our team members are working differently than they did 10 years ago and five years ago. They are spending more time with customers and less time in the office. So we have an opportunity to reduce occupancy cost and reduce our square footage over time. That would be an example. John Stumpf : Mike, something else you could think about is that we still have a number of loss mitigation folks as we are still working with elevated foreclosure and those kinds of issues but on the other hand then we are investing more in operational risk and compliance and those sort of things. So you are right. We are at the higher-end of that range but on the other hand as you know that's a ratio. It's a numerator expenses divided by revenue and we have seen revenue because of interest rates on the margin revenues while we have been able to grow NII. The margin is not at an all-time high. So as that improves that will also give you some lift but whatever we do here we will be very careful about what we spend money on but never at the expense of the long-term but we are focused on it. That's a good point you bring up. Mike Mayo - CLSA: That's why I brought up, revenues are down year-over-year and you are still at the high-end of the efficiency range but I guess we will hear more about that at the investor conference? John Stumpf : Actually, that's actually a good thing. Think of revenues down and we actually improve the efficiency ratio but there is opportunity and yes, you are right, we will talk more about that. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And then if you can just elaborate on the management changes, John. I guess you are gearing for the next generation. How much longer do you plan to stay around and who would be in the pool of potential successors? John Stumpf : Well, I am glad you asked and I was going to give you that information. I am 60. I know you think I look a lot younger but I plan to stay here as the Board is okay with that and they want me through my 65th birthday and we have got great people here. We have a terrific team of leaders and you know some of them. I wish you could know more. For those of you who come to our investor conference next month you will get to meet more of them. Please come. That's one of the reasons we love to show you more of them. But this is a great team and I couldn't be more confident. In fact I think it's the best team in the industry. And one thing, even though, and Dave has been such a great leader, even with his leaving, the average tenure of my tenure is still around 28 years with this company. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Thank you. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Hi, guys. Tim Sloan : Hi, Matt. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : I am sorry if I missed it but did you provide the estimated leverage ratio under the new rules that came out last week or this week? Tim Sloan : Matt, we didn't and we are still working through that calculation but just assume that at the parent company level, we are comfortably above 7%. So it's really not an issue for us. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay and that leads me to my next question. If we look at the three banks that are bigger than you, I think when you kind of put together all the new requirements out there for capital liquidity, it's a bit more onerous for them than it is for you. I am just wondering like are you actually seeing them pullback in certain areas that you now feel like you can compete in and has that changed since last year when we first got the current proposals for the SLR? Tim Sloan : Matt, I wish that was the case. The business is very competitive across the board today. We expected that all of our competitors are going to adjust to whatever the new rules are. We have candidly been doing that since 2009 but it's a competitive market out there and hopefully for whatever reason, we can continue to grow. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay, and then just lastly, a number of lumpy either revenue items or the tax gain, anything on the expense side besides a seasonal increase in cost that you would want to point out like litigation costs or anything else lumpy that we should be thinking about? Tim Sloan : No. Not beyond the seasonal items in the first quarter but again I want to emphasize that you should expect some increases in other line items within expenses in the second quarter that I called out but nothing in the quarter that was lumpy from an expense standpoint other than the seasonal compensation related items. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay, on that expense outlook, when you piece together the decline in some of the seasonal benefits and increases elsewhere, if we just kind of hold revenue flat quarter-to-quarter, do expenses stay flat or go up or down or what's the net of all those items? Tim Sloan : Yes, Matt, we will know for sure in about 90 days and I just don't know what the exact dollar expenses will be but one of the reasons why I called out some of the categories is reducing some of those categories are going to rise relative to their first quarter numbers. But again a lot of our expenses are driven off revenue. If revenues are higher in the second quarter and that's the reason that expenses are up, I think, we will all be very, very happy. John Stumpf : Yes, I don't think any of us look to the future and say let's hold revenues flat. We think we are a growth company. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thank you. Tim Sloan : Thank you, Matt. John Stumpf : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim: Thanks. I wanted to talk a little bit about the macro hedge on the mortgage side. The servicing profitability has actually tripled since last year, going from $300 million to about $900 million per quarter. That represents more than half of the mortgage banking income. So I just wanted to talk about and get your feelings on further improvements in that as we move forward and just have few precise questions about maybe some items that could help there as well. Tim Sloan : Well, Marty, you are absolutely correct. Our servicing income is up significantly over the past few years or the past few quarters as you can see. The drivers are primarily the fact that the underlying quality of the portfolio continues to improve. So there is less adjustments that we need to take to the value for things like foreclosure cost to make any changes related to the consent order or servicing settlement and so on and so forth. In terms of the hedge, I wouldn't think about it as kind of a macro hedge. It's a very complicated set of hedging activities that we need to do. We have got a large group of people that does it. They are very experienced but as we have talked about in the past, we are not trying to make any sort of macro bets from an interest rate standpoint or in terms of a market standpoint. We are just trying to generate a predictable set of earnings from an underlying business that we like a lot. It was very beneficial when we went through the refinancing boom and we believe can continue to provide good earnings. You are absolutely correct that it's a larger portion of earnings than maybe the origination side but my guess is that's going to change from quarter-to-quarter depending upon origination volume. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim: When I meant macro-hedge, I meant more originations versus servicing, not the hedging and the servicing portfolio. Tim Sloan : Well, I am sorry. Yes, you are right. But again, I think sometimes folks think that somehow the servicing business is a natural hedge to origination volume and given what we have seen over the last year or so, given the size of the refinance opportunity, we can see that really wasn't the case. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim: To some point but not completely? Tim Sloan : Correct. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim: When you look at the prepayment speeds, not really accelerating with refinance, not really coming off the floor, you still wrote down the MSRs about $400 million this quarter. I know rates came back in but really cash flow is what matter more than just a rate. So rates are proxy. But if don't get a significant increase in prepayment fees there really shouldn't be further write-downs in the portfolio at this point. So I was just curious what you thought or what was driving that write down this quarter? Tim Sloan : Well, you are absolutely correct that rates are a driver. We have seen a lot of volatility in rates for certain but again rates are the primary driver, also just underlying prepayment fees that we are seeing for other reasons in terms of how quickly folks are selling their homes and moving elsewhere but our best guess is that we could continue to see some benefit from the servicing portfolio. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim: And then lastly, the provision for unfunded commitments jumped up this quarter about $250 million. Is that something we should see at the same level? Or is that something you made a little adjustment on this quarter that might fall back as you move forward? Tim Sloan : Well, it's a reflection of the fact that our loan commitments grew which is a good thing but also we just adjusted some of our estimates and I wouldn't anticipate that that would repeat itself on a quarterly basis. Marty Mosby - Guggenheim: All right. Thanks. Tim Sloan : Thank you. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Good morning, guys. How are you? John Stumpf : Hi Nancy. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: A question for you that, I think John McDonald asked the question about the release in loan loss reserves and I would sort of ask for an additional detail on that. How much of this release was enabled by the reserves you built after the Wachovia deal? In other words how much or how many of these reserves are related to better credit quality at Wachovia than you had anticipated? Tim Sloan : You know what, I don't have the percentage off the top of my head, Nancy. I think what you saw is that we continued to build reserves throughout 2009 and I am trying to remember what quarter we stopped building reserves. I thought it was through most of 2009 but I would say it's a reflection of clearly improved credit quality in the underlying portfolio that we inherited from Wachovia as well as the Wells portfolio but I don't know what the percentage is just related to that because today it's really all mixed. We don't really think about it that way. John Stumpf : But Nancy, you are right to this extent. The Wachovia portfolio turned out to be better than we had thought and if you just look at how much we have moved from, on the PCI side into the accretable from the non-accretable, and we especially did a lot better on the Pick-a-Pay. We just had a terrific team that attacked that early on but credit turned out, I think partly because of things that we did. It turned out to be quite a lot better. Tim Sloan : But Nancy, again, just to reinforce John's last comment and I should have mentioned it, most of the improvement that we saw in the Wachovia portfolio, was really in what you see in PCI and the detail we provide there as opposed to in the loan loss reserve. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Okay. Secondly, this is sort of a tangential credit quality question and has to do with Dave Hoyt's decision to retire. Number one, Tim, congratulations but with the admonition that timing is everything in life. Secondly, Dave Hoyt was the best in the industry at two things, number one, not answering a question. He was expert at that. But number two, just foreseeing credit quality trends way in advance and I have had the question from others and I am a little bit concerned that Dave is sort of looking out into the future here and seeing that commercial credit quality is about as good as it's going to get. Could you just comment on that? Tim Sloan : Well, Nancy I worked for Dave for about 20 years and he absolutely was a terrific judge of credit quality. I think if Dave was on the phone, he would also say that there were hundreds if not thousands of people that there were behind him in wholesale banking that helped in that. So there's no question that Dave's retirement is something that we weren't looking forward to. But we have a great team here and I would not read into his retirement as him saying from here on in credit quality is going to significantly deteriorate at Wells Fargo. In fact, I think it's more likely that it's going to continue to improve. Now the likelihood in the commercial portfolio that we are going to continue to have quarters of recovery as opposed to loan losses, that's not going to happen forever. But the fact of the matter is that culture really matters and the culture that we have in the wholesale banking group in terms of making good credit decisions is going to continue on, because that's what Dave was very good at instilling in thousands of people within the wholesale banking group. John Stumpf : And I can tell you my perspective and while I have not had that much time with Dave, I have only had 16 years with him. He is retiring. He has a fabulous family including grandchildren. He has a lot of other interests and he just felt it was right for him and while we are sad to see him go, we celebrate with him his next stage and as Tim mentioned, his legacy are the thousands of people that he has led that are in leadership roles right now that continue to propel this business forward. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Well, please let him know that I am sure I am not the only analyst who is going to miss sparring with him. One other thing. On private equity, just the gains you had, you guys has long had an expertise in technology, private equity investments and is that still or is that sort of the primary source of a lot of the gains this quarter? Tim Sloan : It was a source of some of the gains, Nancy, but it was really across the board. We had, as I mentioned, about the same resolutions, I would say about half were in technology-related, the other half weren't. And we are very pleased with the gains that we had this quarter but as you can appreciate that you can't count on those at the same level every quarter. I wish we could but this is a very buoyant time in the equity markets, both public and private, notwithstanding some of the market volatility over the last couple of days and we have got good management teams. As you said, we have been in the business for a long time. So we continue to be optimistic about the long-term success of those businesses but quarter-to-quarter, it's going to be what's it's going to be. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: All right. Thank you very much. John Stumpf : Thank you, Nancy. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hi Paul. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Hi. This is actually Jessica Ribner for Paul. How are you? John Stumpf : Well, we have upgraded. How are you, Jessica? Tim Sloan : Good. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : You have upgraded. It's true. Then who is going to read the transcripts. You guys have actually shrunk your market share almost in half to about 16% over the last couple quarters or the last few quarters I should say but you are also talking about growing it. Where do you see that going? Tim Sloan : Yes, sure. It's a good question. Again if you step back and think about the time at which, in the cycle that our market share was so high, arguably two times, maybe a little bit less than that, it was because the primary source of mortgage origination volume depending upon the quarter could have been two-thirds of volume or three quarters of volume or even more in some quarters was refinance volume. So that's reflective of the fact that we are the largest servicer. We had the highest-quality servicing portfolio and generally those customers gave us the first call and we were able to meet their needs by refinancing that mortgage. We had indicated that we thought that as the refinancing volume declined and as the mix changed to more of a purchase money market, our market share would go down. So that was absolutely anticipated but we don't think of the business as a market share business. We think about it as how do we solve the needs of our customers. Do we have the right number of people in the right places? As John mentioned, we got the best distribution system in the market and so we are optimistic about being able to grow. Whether that means we will grow market share? I don't know but we are optimistic about growth in the business. John Stumpf : Jessica, the other thing you should think about is that the 16% or whatever that number is 16% or 17%, part of it is in aggregation business where we do correspondent banking business and which we love that business but it's a lower margin business and part of it is a retail business where we actually originate the loan through one of our home mortgage consultants. Some of the correspondent business is going directly to Fannie and Freddie. So that business is actually changing a bit. So when you look even at the time when we had maybe double that share, you have to look at both sides of that and while I focus on all of it, it's also important to make that distinguishment. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Okay, well. Thank you. And then kind of a related question. You guys said earlier on the call that you added about $7.2 billion, it sounds like jumbo mortgages on the balance sheet. Is that correct? Tim Sloan : No. Our loan growth was primarily, on a gross basis for the quarter was about $7 billion point-to-point. The growth in non-conforming mortgages on a gross basis, which would be the jumbo category, was about $5.8 billion. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Okay, and where do you see that trend going? Tim Sloan : Hopefully it will continue to go up. I think that one of the areas that we indicated a couple of years ago at our Investor Day was a real effort on the part of our team in the wealth area as well as in our retail banking area to coordinate more on those opportunities and they have done just a terrific job. So we are hopeful with the improvement in the weather and the spring selling season that we will continue to see that grow over time. John Stumpf : The one's we put on portfolio are very small part of the originations. It's less than 5% or so. So there's opportunity there. Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets : Okay, great. Well, thank you very much. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Please go ahead. John Stumpf : Hi Keith. Keith Murray - Keith Murray : It's actually Keith Murray for Keith Murray. So it\u2019s a bit of a downgrade for your guys. Sorry. John Stumpf : We still think that\u2019s an upgrade. Keith Murray - Keith Murray : Thank you very much. Just on all the new rules, you have got Basel III, you have got SLR, you have got LCR. When you think about loan pricing and pricing for commitments, has that all been factored in yet and are you still kind of working through the changes that will have to be made? Tim Sloan : Really good question. I don't believe that the industry, set us aside for a minute, the industry has necessarily adjusted yet because their capital rules have just been finalized. The leverage rules, for example, are relatively new and we haven't seen the final liquidity rules. I am sure there will be some adjustments, just like there's been adjustments to all the other new rules and regulations that we have post-crisis. So I think it's more in the future than in the past. Keith Murray - Keith Murray : Okay, and then are you seeing much impact from non-bank lenders out there? Every private equity firm, non-banks are seeing a lot of them try to do more loans to the middle market firms. So are you seeing much impact at all? Tim Sloan : Well, there's no question that post-crisis, given a lot of the regulatory changes created opportunities for unregulated or differently regulated institutions and that's been the case for as long as I have been in the lending business and been with the bank. I think the important point to make is that generally though those firms frequently are very good are monoline firms and that is they have one product they can provide credit. How we differentiate ourselves is that we have relationships and that we can provide tens of products or more and broaden that relationship. So we don't find ourselves losing a lot of business to non-banks. I also think that generally the competitive environment is a little bit more rational than it would be today. But again, we have a real advantage when we compete against a monoline product provider versus our relationship-focused and cross-sell orientation. Keith Murray - Keith Murray : Thanks, and then just finally, on fee based businesses that you have, if you look out for the rest of this year and through 2015, which of those businesses do you think has the most potential upside for revenue growth. John Stumpf : We really all of our businesses. In fact, we think there's growth opportunity but a couple of them jump out wealth, brokerage, retirement. You saw that we are at 41% and I don't think we can do 41% every quarter or every year but that's a huge growth opportunity for us. The card business. We think we have got some exciting things happening there but that doesn't diminish anything else. We have opportunities with what we are doing international because we have more of our U.S. customers doing business there. We have opportunity in our capital markets businesses and even mortgage where you think where people would say, well, geez, you have the number one share. There is huge opportunity there. Half of our customers who call us at our bank who have a mortgage don't do it with us. So there is all kinds of opportunity here. Keith Murray - Keith Murray : Okay. Thank you. John Stumpf : Thank you. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey : Thanks very much. Hello. Just a couple of follow-up questions. One is, I know that your card fees declined by about the same amount as they did in the first quarter of last year but in terms of your actual charge volumes was there any decline that was more than what is typically seasonal in this first quarter? Tim Sloan : No. Not at all. Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey : No. So in other words, no disruption from weather or any other exogenous temporary employment or any other exogenous factor? Tim Sloan : No. Not at all. Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay, and just turning to the gain on sale trend for a moment. I recognize that the changes weren't big but most of the proxies that we use suggested flat and so I am just wondering if there was anything in mix or otherwise that would have explained the decline? Tim Sloan : No. There wasn't necessarily a big change in mix. That's one of the reasons why we have provided a range beginning in the third quarter of last year. I think there was a concern in the market that as volume went down that gain on sale margins would go down significantly. We think that the range that we have provided plus or minus 1.5% is a reasonable range to operate in but comparing any quarter, 5 to 10 to even 15 basis point level of volatility is not uncommon at all. Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey : Great, and then lastly, just getting back to Brian's question about the accretion of Basel III capital versus the growth in earnings, recognizing that there should be convergence, it also seems that the quality of the portfolio that you have originated over the past few years has lower embedded risk. So wouldn't that suggest that as the risk component becomes an increasingly important determinant of your Tier 1 under the Basel III, wouldn't that suggest that Basel III capital continues to grow ahead of what the earnings math would otherwise suggest? Tim Sloan : It could, but again, because it's a more complicated calculation right now because you have got the impact of market risk, you have got the impact of operational risk and candidly, the operational risk calculations for the regulators as well as the entire industry continues to be a work in progress and influx. I wouldn't want to jump to a conclusion that just underlying credit quality only would be the sole driver of improvement in RWA. Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey : Great, and then just last one for me and I hate to come back to this topic because it's already been addressed many times, reserve releases. The nonperforming assets continue to come down but many of the forward-looking credit quality indicators are starting to flatten in terms of their sequential improvement. So all was equal and, of course, your portfolio of loans continues to grow, so all was equal, wouldn't that indicate that the pace of reserve release should start to decline also? Tim Sloan : Well, it could and, to your point, that's what you have seen over the last three quarters. We went from a $900 million release in the third quarter to $600 million last quarter to $500 million this quarter. I don't know what the release is going to be in the second quarter. We do believe we are going to have a release but it's a fair point. I mean, this is not going to go on forever but the fact of the matter is the portfolio continues to improve. Eric Wasserstrom - Suntrust Robinson Humphrey : Okay, all right. Thanks very much. Tim Sloan.: Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS. Please go ahead. John Stumpf : Derek? Operator : Derek, your line maybe on mute. If you are on a speaker phone, please pick up your handset. And there is no response from that line. John Stumpf : All right. Why don't we then conclude. Let me make a couple of comments. First of all, I would like to thank Tim Sloan for the great work he's done as our CFO. As you all know, he's going to take over the Wholesale Bank but Tim, thank you for the great leadership and the work you have done here. You have just been terrific. For those of you who don't know John Shrewsbury, many of you do, you will get to see him, if not before but you will surely see him when you come to our investor conference, remember that was May 20 in San Francisco. We look forward to seeing you. It's always an exciting time for us to talk about our business and share with you the enthusiasm and some of the great people that we have. So thank you very much for your interest in Wells Fargo and we will talk to you next quarter and the investor conference earlier than that. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all participating and you may now disconnect.",

I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf. John Stumpf : Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The second quarter was another strong quarter for Wells Fargo. We earned $5.7 billion in the quarter by our continued focused on creating long-term shareholder value to meeting our customers' financial needs including growing loans and deposits and deepening our relationships with our customers.  Let me highlight our growth during the second quarter compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.7 billion, up 4% from a year ago and earnings per share up $1.01 per share, up 3% from a year ago. We had strong and broad based loan growth and our core loan portfolio is up $51.3 billion or 7%. Our credit performance continued to improve with total net charge-offs down $435 million or 38% from a year ago, and our net charge-off ratio was only 35 basis points annualized on average loans. Our outstanding deposit franchise continues to generate strong growth. With total deposit up $97 billion or 9%. We've grown deposits by an average of $265 million everyday over the past year. We deepened relationships across our company. Retail banking cross-sell was 6.17 products per household. Wholesale banking cross-sell was 7.2 products and wealth, brokerage and retirement cross-sell was 10.44 products. We reduced expenses from a year ago while we continue to invest in our businesses including strengthening our risk management infrastructure. We also follow through our commitment to maintain strong capital ratios while returning more capital to shareholders. In the second quarter we increased our common stock dividend by 17% and continued to reduce our share count. We returned our net $3.6 billion to shareholders in the second quarter, up significantly from $1.6 billion a year ago. I am also proud that during the second quarter Wells Fargo was ranked the most respected bank in the world and the 11th most respected company overall according to Barron's Magazine 2014 ranking of the world's most respected companies. This recognition is a result of our dedicated team members remaining focused on our consistent vision and their commitment to meeting our customers' financial needs. While the economic recovery remains uneven, there are many indicators that economic growth is accelerating and we remain optimistic about the opportunities the recovery provide to Wells Fargo and for our customers. The strong improvement employment in June demonstrated the strength in a labor market with unemployment at lowest level since September 2008. The housing market rebound remained on-track with home prices up 8% from a year ago and up 25% from the low in June 2011. Despite these increases home affordability continued to remain attractive due to historically low mortgage rates and rising household incomes. In June, the conference board's measure of consumer confidence reached a six year high and vehicle sales reached an eight year high. The economy is also benefiting from strong energy production with domestic crude oil production running at the highest level in 26 years and our reliance on foreign energy sources has been falling for nearly a decade.  I am confident that the economic recovery and our diversified business model will continue to provide opportunities for future growth as we remain focused on helping our customers meet their financial needs.  Now John Shrewsberry, our CFO will provide more details on our second quarter results. John? John Shrewsberry : Thanks, John. And good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. Wells Fargo had a very strong quarter as demonstrated by fundamental drivers of long-term growth. We earned $5.7 billion in the second quarter; down a $167 million from the first quarter but keep in mind our results last quarter included a $423 million discrete tax benefit and $0.08 per share impact. Our pre-tax income grew $303 million from the first quarter. Revenue grew from first quarter including both net interest income and noninterest income. Core loans grew 8% annualized and average deposits grew 9% annualized. We grew pre-tax, pre-provision profit for the third consecutive quarter and credit quality continued to improve. Capital remains strong and we returned more capital to shareholders. I will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call today. As John highlighted and as you can see on Page 3, we had strong year-over-year growth in loans and deposits. Our growth in EPS and net income reflected this benefit along with the reduction in expenses and an improvement in credit quality. Our results were driven by momentum across many of our businesses. One way to demonstrate this business momentum is through noninterest income growth. Mortgage fees while up from first quarter were down $1.1 billion from a year ago due to lower refinancing volume. Excluding mortgage fees, fee income was up 9% from a year ago reflecting broad based growth in retail brokerage, deposit service charges, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage commissions, trust and investment management, merchant processing and market sensitive revenue. That's the benefit of our diversification. We have over 90 businesses focused on meeting our customers' financial needs. We also grew net interest income from a year ago. And as you know growing net interest income measured in dollars has been our focus as deposits and other sources of liquidity have growth more rapidly than loan demand or other attractive investment opportunities. Page 4 highlights our revenue diversification. While our balance between net interest income and noninterest income has been consistent, the drivers of noninterest income can vary each quarter. For example, equity investments were 9% of our fee income in the first quarter but declined to 4% in the second quarter. Other businesses such as deposits, investment banking and mortgage contributed more to fee income this quarter resulting in overall fee income growth demonstrating the benefit of diversified business model. Let me highlight some of the key drivers of our second quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective starting on Page 5. Our balance sheet is never been stronger, capital liquidity, asset quality, funding mix are all exceedingly strong. We increased average earnings assets by 3% from the first quarter by growing loans, increasing short-term investment in trading assets and purchasing securities. In addition, our credit quality continues to improve. Investment securities increased $8.7 billion from first quarter reflecting $17 billion of purchases primarily U.S. Treasuries and federal agency debt partially offset by run off. We also improved our liquidity position in response to continued heightened regulatory expectations. We issued $7.8 billion of liquidity related long-term debt and increased liquidity related short-term funding by $5.9 billion. Total short-term investments grew to $238.7 billion which helps us meet our regulatory obligations and provides dry powder to grow loan and invest in securities. Turning to the income statement on Page 6, revenue grew $441 million with growth in both net interest income and noninterest income. The $246 million growth in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher revenue based incentive compensation and deferred compensation expense and an increase in operating losses primarily from litigation accruals related to various legal matters. I'll explain the drivers of our expenses in more detail later on the call.  Income tax expense increased from the first quarter which included $423 million discrete tax benefit. As shown on Page 7, we continue to have strong, broad based loan growth in the second quarter. Our 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth even with the continued reduction in our liquidating portfolio of $56.5 billion over the same time period. Our core portfolio which excludes our liquidating portfolio grew by $51.3 billion or 7% from a year ago and was up $15.2 billion or 8% annualized from the first quarter. Period end loans were up $29 billion or 4% from a year ago and up $2.5 billion from the first quarter. This growth was impacted by the transfer of $9.7 billion of government guaranteed student loans to held for sale which removes them from total loans. These student loans have been included within our liquidating portfolio since we stopped originating them in 2010. We transferred this portfolio to held for sale at the end of the second quarter reflecting our intent to sell our entire government guaranteed portfolio. However, we remained committed to the private student lending business. Excluding this transfer, total loans would have increased to $12.2 billion or 6% annualized linked quarter. On Page 8 we highlight how broad -based our loan growth continues to be at Wells Fargo. C&I loans were up $19.4 billion or 10% from a year ago as we successfully grew loans across our commercial businesses including asset backed, corporate, government, commercial and asset based. Real-estate 1 to 4 family first mortgage loans grew $7.3 billion or 3% with growth in high quality nonconforming mortgage primarily jumbo loans. Foreign loans grew $6.2 billion or 15% from a year ago reflecting growth in trade finance and the U.K. Commercial Real Estate acquisition we completed in the third quarter of last year. Auto loans were $5.5 billion or 11% reflecting strong origination as we remained the number one auto lender in the country while maintaining our focus on pricing for risk. Commercial real estate loans were $4.4 billion or 4% reflecting new origination and an acquisition in the third quarter of last year. Credit card balances were $2.4 billion or 10% with new accounts up 4%. Our growth rate has been above the industry average reflecting new account growth, product enhancement and increased usage among our existing customers. Deposit growth also remained strong in the second quarter with average deposits growing $91.7 billion or 9% from a year ago and up $24.2 billion from the first quarter, up 9% annualized. Average deposits totaled $1.1 Trillion and we benefited from strong growth in both commercial and consumer balances. Our average deposit cost declined to 10 basis points in the second quarter, down 1 basis point from the first quarter and down 4 basis points from a year ago. Our ability to generate strong deposit growth while reducing deposit cost demonstrated the fundamental strength of our outstanding deposit franchise. We have been able to grow deposits by offering best in class products and excellent customer experience and robust multi channel option. Our primary consumer checking customers were up 4.6% from a year ago. Our ability to grow primary customers is important to our results because these customers have more interaction with us, have higher cross-sell and are more than twice as profitable as non primary customers.  As shown on Page 10, tax equivalent net interest income increased $184 million from first quarter benefiting from an additional day in the quarter organic loan growth in higher mortgages held for sale in trading assets. Our NIM declined from the first quarter to 3.15% driven by customer deposit growth which essentially neutral to net interest income but reduced the margin by approximately five basis points. Liquidity related actions we took in the second quarter to meet increase regulatory liquidity expectations reduced the margin by one basis point however higher income from variable sources including higher PCI resolutions and periodic dividends offset this decline. Balance sheet repricing in growth once again did not impact the NIM this quarter as the majority of the repricing from the higher rate environment to the current rate environment is behind us.  Noninterest income increased $265 million from the first quarter with growth across our diversified businesses including mortgage banking, investment banking, deposit service charges, card fees, retail brokerage, commercial real estate brokerage and insurance, offsetting a $460 million decline in market sensitive revenue. Market sensitive revenue declined 34% from first quarter while all other noninterest income grew 8%. Trust and investment fees increased $197 million or 6% from first quarter on higher investment banking and retail brokerage asset based fees. Mortgage banking grew $213 million from first quarter, up 14% with growth in both originations and servicing. The second quarter benefited from a seasonally stronger purchase market with 74% of our originations coming from home purchases, up from 66% last quarter. Total originations increased to $47 billion, up 31% are unclosed pipeline increased to $30 billion at the end of the quarter, up 11%. We also continue to see improvement in our net servicing results for servicing revenue up $97 million from the first quarter reflecting higher MSR hedge performance and an increase in net servicing fees reflecting the benefit of lower servicing and foreclosure costs.  As shown on Page 12, expenses were up $246 million from the first quarter while our efficiency ratio remained at 57.9% reflecting our revenue growth. The key drivers of our expenses included personnel expenses declined $106 million from the first quarter which included seasonally elevated incentive compensation and benefit cost, salary increased as expected due to annual merit increases and one extra day in the quarter. Personnel expense included $130 million of higher revenue based incentive compensation in the second quarter which is a type of expense increase we like to see because we are growing the top line. Additionally, personnel expenses were impacted by $84 million in higher deferred compensation expense which offset in trading revenue. Outside professional services and advertising expense increased from the first quarter levels which tend to be seasonally lower. And operating losses increased $205 million from the first quarter largely due to litigation accruals for various legal matters. We remained focused on managing expenses and we expect our efficiency ratio will remain within our target range of 55% to 59% for the third quarter. Turning to our business segment starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the second quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 11% from first quarter primarily from higher taxes. Retail banking cross-sell was 6.17 products per household, up from 6.14 a year ago. Our debit and credit card businesses continued to grow benefiting from account growth and higher usage. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago driven primarily -- driven by primarily checking customer growth. Credit card purchase volume was 16% from a year ago with new account growth and more active accounts. Active accounts were up 14% as the Wells Fargo credit card is becoming more top- of-wallet for our customers. Credit card household penetration increased to 39%, up from 35% a year ago. We remained committed to serving our small business customers at an increased primary business checking account customers 5.2% from a year ago. During the second quarter, we launched Wells Fargo Works for Small Business, an initiative that provides guidance and services to small business owners. This new initiative is resulted in strong engagement with small businesses across the country including millions of views of our online video series and increased traffic to wellsfargoworks.com. Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter down 3% from a year ago and up 12% from the first quarter. Loan growth remained strong and broad based across businesses, up 8% from a year ago and up 2% from first quarter. Capital finance increased $2 billion from first quarter driven by higher utilization rates, new customer growth and growth in factoring assets. Commercial banking grew $1.8 billion from the first quarter with widespread growth across geographies and industries. Commercial real estate grew $1.4 billion driven by new loan originations including customer M&A activity. In addition, corporate banking, government and institutional banking, asset backed financed and equipment financed portfolios all grew from the first quarter. Revenue increased 7% from the first quarter reflecting diversified growth across a number of wholesale banking businesses. Investment banking revenue growth was broad based across product categories. Eastdil Secured, our commercial real estate brokerage business increased revenue, strong performance in public and private markets. Asset management fees grew -- from increased market valuation and in flows. Total assets under management increased $35 billion from a year ago. Long-term assets including equity and fixed income strategies were up 12% while money market funds have declined by 4% from a year ago. The shift out of money market funds moderating growth in total asset under management but revenue benefited from the shift to higher fee generating long-term assets. Wholesale banking revenue also benefited from the sale of 40 insurance offices in the quarter.  Wealth brokerage and retirement earned $544 million in the second quarter, up 25% from a year ago and up 15% from the first quarter. The strong year-over-year results reflected 9% revenue growth driven by recurring revenue. Net interest income was 11% from a year ago and asset based fees were up 14% benefiting from market performance and continued client demand for plan based advisory solutions. Our brokerage advisory assets have grown to $409 billion, up $78 billion or 24% from a year ago. Loan growth remained strong with average loans of 12% from a year ago driven by growth in high quality nonconforming mortgages in security based lending. We also benefited from the partnership involving WBR and community banking to better meet our customers' saving retirement planning and investment needs and we increased the number of private bankers in our banking stores by 22% from a year ago. Turning to Page 16, credit quality continue to improve with second quarter credit losses down $108 million from first quarter and the net charge-off ratio decline into 35 basis points of average loans. Losses in our commercial portfolio were only 3 basis points of average loans and consumer losses continue to decline to 62 basis points. Nonperforming assets have declined for seven consecutive quarters and were down $686 million from first quarter although the pace of improvement is slowed. We had a $500 million reserve release is same as in first quarter. We continue to expect future reserve releases, absent a significant deterioration in the economy but expect a lower level of future releases as the rate of credit improvement slows and the loan portfolio continues to grow. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach fully phased-in increased to 10.09% in the second quarter. Our share count declined in the quarter reflecting the repurchase of 39.4 million common shares and we executed a $1 billion forward repurchase contract which expected to settle in the third quarter for approximately 19.4 million shares. We expect our share count to continue to decline throughout 2014 as a result of anticipated net share repurchases. We also increased our dividend to $0.35 per share in the second quarter a 17% increase. Our net payout ratio in the second quarter was 66% in line with our recent guidance of 55% to 75%. In summary, our results in the second quarter demonstrated the momentum across our fundamental business drivers including growing loans and deposits, increasing both net interest income and noninterest income while credit improved and capital remained strong. While we've demonstrated our ability to grow during the variety of economic and interest rate environments, we are well positioned to benefit from an improving economy and higher rates. Our diversified business model provides us with many opportunities to better meet our customers' financial needs as economic growth become robust. Our strong balance sheet with our large balance of short-term investments primarily driven by our strong deposit growth provides us the ability to further grow loans and invest in securities. We are optimistic that our outstanding franchise and our focus on serving the real economy will continue to produce strong results. We will now open up the call for questions. Jim? Operator :  (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Hi, good morning. John, was wondering on the legal side of things. Can you give us a sense of what type of legal issues you are building reserves for? And also can you comment whether you are having discussion with the DOJ and mortgage task force, made up of state AGs that other banks are having discussion with? John Shrewsberry : The best disclosure for our legal activity is found in our Q and K where there is great detail on item that are probable and estimable and frankly even more matters, we can't comment on anything specifically. The items that I referred in the expense section or variety of matters that essentially added up to the number that you saw. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : On the loan growth, can you comment what you are seeing in terms of utilization of lines by customers, is that getting better and what's driving what appears to be slight kind of acceleration in the loan growth you saw this quarter. John Shrewsberry :  Well, we called out one area where there has been an increase in utilization in the comments that was in capital finance but overall in wholesale banking utilization is relatively flat, it's ticked up just a little bit. So this is -- this loan growth isn't just driven by that. John Stumpf : John, the nice thing about the loan growth is broad based. If you look at it's consumer, it's private banking area, commercial and cross so it's really broad based, it is one of the -- I think the strengths in what we have been doing the last number of quarters especially this quarter. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And then last thing for me John on the net interest income side of things. Do you know at this point is the liquidity building you have been doing, is that done or you are not sure yet on that front? John Shrewsberry : We think that where we stand today is probably about where you need to be and if the final rule making around LCR comes in a little bit differently then the actions that we have to take shouldn't materially change things so we are about where you need to be. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And seems that the churn has stopped with your reinvestment rates kind of looking like they match your roll-off rates. So I guess from -- with that perspective in mind, are you looking to grow an interest income dollar kind of in line with loan growth from here or there are other factors we should think about? John Shrewsberry : Well, you should be -- should look at the balance sheet at every period and assess what types of inflows we have of additional liquidity and what we have done with it. Some of will be loan growth, there will be more security growth; there will be some that sits in cash while we wait to make decision about securities investments. So the facts and circumstances will lead it on that path but back to your question about roll-off and roll-on, it appears that the NIM hasn't been diminished by a change in pricing scheme with respect to loans or securities for that better because of what you described. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein :   Okay. And you are still looking to grow net interest income from the current levels? Do you still think you can do that? John Stumpf : Absolutely Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks, good morning, everyone. Hi, there. I guess first was just on-- upon -- question on the loan growth. I guess specifically in C&I end of period loan were up little over $9 billion or almost 5% sequentially, the strongest increase to the past year. I was just curious little bit more what's driving that? Are you are seeing signs of increase confidence among borrowers and may be more of a willingness to make investment? John Stumpf : Joe, this is John Stumpf. We are seeing that. As I am always talking with customers and our talking with our team, there is as I mentioned in my opening comments, there is more optimism. I think consumer confidence is at six year high. It is not breakout but it's -- we are having more discussion with more customers about buying homes, buying autos, investing in infrastructure if you are a business, buying something so we are real economy company. We are in the real economy and there are certain sectors of economy that are doing very well. We are big energy lender both on renewal side and the hydrocarbon side, plus the real estate has been very good for us, little market such it's very broad based. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : Okay, that's great, thanks. I guess the other question was just if you could talk a little bit more about what's your experience has been in mortgage with the spring selling season. And how do you feel about both volumes and staffing levels for the rest of the year there? John Shrewsberry : Sure. Well, we've been pretty clear on the record that we found the spring selling season to be little less than we have originally imagined, although it is nice growth from the first quarter just based on the time of year. And our view on the whole year in terms of mortgage origination is not inconsistent with the MBA and other published metrics. So you can see our pipeline going into the third quarter higher than it was going into the second. So that's probably means good things for the third quarter relative to the second quarter. The margins are holding in there. But we are not seeing -- we are not seeing a breakout returns to pre crisis levels of the enthusiasm around home ownership and so the purchase market is softer than we thought that it would be. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : And is that like to drive any other right sizing on the staffing side or do you feel pretty good about where you stand there? John Shrewsberry : I think -- we have been very good at being flexible about that work force. And adding as we needed to as production volumes increased and then making changes as production volume decrease. So I think we are keeping that in sync with the production opportunity. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch : Good morning. Hey, my first question is a follow up to John's line of questioning. The first is you feel like you in are where you need to be in terms of liquidity. And the majority of the repricing from the high interest environment as you said John to the current interest rate environment is behind you. Can we assume that Wells Fargo's net interest margin is close to the bottom with the wild card being deposit growth being stronger continuing to be stronger? John Stumpf : I would say this way Erika. Again, we don't manage to the margin; deposit growth has an impact on the margin. What we say -- what we are saying is we are focused on growing net interest income and we believe we can do that. And loan demands been good and that is good for growing net interest income. Secondly, we have millions of dollars available in that cash flow if you will, to make investments at the right time so we are optimistic about growing net interest income over the long term. The margin will be impacted by -- cost growth has a big influence on that. And again most at neutral to income if not neutral to the margin. Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch : And the second follow up question just as we think about the next quarter's earnings power, I know that it is in the appendix that you did reclassify about $2 billion from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield and you are expecting the yield on the Pick-a-Pay portfolio or the accretable percentage to be 6.15% from 4.98% this quarter, is that going to have a positive impact on net interest margin as sequential basis as we take into account all the different components of the core balance sheet that we talked about so far in this call. John Shrewsberry : You should think about that as worth about $65 million per quarter in terms of incremental accreted interest income. It's related to the $1.9 billion re-class from nonaccretable yield to accretable yield and over the life that it will accrete under and based on the balance it's related to. Helpful? Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch :   Got it. And just -- yes, and the third follow up question is another follow up to John's. I know you are not going to answer any questions about litigation in depth but I guess as we think about further accruals in your litigation reserve, can we expect as we think about the next few quarters Wells Fargo continuing to maintain at 55% to 59% efficiency ratio despite potential higher operating losses from legal accrual? John Shrewsberry : I would say that given everything that we know we anticipate operating between 55% and 59%. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Thanks, good morning. First question just on the mortgage business. I am just wondering John, two things. First of all, just your general sense of the gain on sale environment, obviously it is continue to reset lower but do you think we've gone to more stable kind of base here? John Stumpf : Yes, I do. I think the margins have been running in that 140 to 160 range and from what we see there is rationality in pricing. And those margins are look reasonable to us. We have no reason to believe it will be markedly different from that in the near future. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: And my second mortgage question and the servicing fees line, it had a nice expansion but with the book not growing and rates back down, so I am wondering can you give us some context of what the growth driver has been underneath that servicing fees line? John Shrewsberry : Well, so it's -- it has a lot to do with servicing expenses. So fewer on reimburse expenses coming through, fewer foreclosure and default expenses so it is more efficient servicing operation and more of the net fees flowing to the bottom line. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. So we will see that all in the Q? John Shrewsberry : Yes. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. Then my third question is just on capital and capital return. Clearly $0.35 dividend, you earned $1.01; so above the 30% threshold that we've known to be the benchmark. So given that we are now past this year's stress test, can you just give us your thoughts around flexibility around and above that 30%? And kind of your post-game on how you have looked at this year's stress test process in that regard. John Shrewsberry : We think 66% payout ratio comes with the combination of repurchase and dividend is an excellent spot to be in. It is between the goal post that we set up 55% to 75%. Can't be much more precise than that but we hear our shareholders loud and clear that they want more return of capital. We are committed to executing on that so that's about all the rest to say. And we look forward CCAR process. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay. Then my last tiny one related to that is just -- the buyback was bigger, the share count just dripped lower. How close are we to finally getting that average diluted share count really starting to move downward? John Shrewsberry : That's a good question. You can see the point-to-point numbers that have changed. The average is what it is just because of the timing in the quarter between when we issued shares to our benefit plans and when shares were repurchased with repurchase was little bit more even throughout that -- throughout the quarter and the issuance was a little bit more front end loaded. So the average didn't change as much as the point-to-point but it will be probably be like that during quarter where there is slightly heavier issuance but yet we expect the net number to trend down the way we've described it. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Hi, what was the amount of gain on the sale of the 40 insurance branches? John Shrewsberry : About a $100 million Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. And conceptually was there anything that offset that? I guess you had the increase in litigation accruals of $200 million. Anything else that would be kind of nonpermanent? John Shrewsberry : It's tough to describe expenses as permanent and non-permanent. I know you are looking for an offset for that non recurring revenue but the expense story is the efficiency ratio story, if we've got for example this quarter higher incentive compensation related to revenue growth that's going to move things around. We've got our deferred comp hedging that moves things around. So it is hard to give you a neat offset to that. Mike Mayo - CLSA: How about the run rate in minority expense? There was a decline and that helped a little bit. Is that permanent? John Shrewsberry : It's hard to say whether that's permanent or not. We will work with Jim Rowe and get you something specific. So we can responsive to that Mike Mayo - CLSA:   Okay. And then the increase in investment banking linked quarter was up a lot. Can you give any context to that? John Shrewsberry : It's broad based so there is some equity capital market, debt capital markets, loans indication, M&A activity, it was just a busier quarter, I think that our investment banking share might have picked up a little bit but the whole market was busier in the second quarter than it was in first quarter. Mike Mayo - CLSA:   And mortgage originations, as you mentioned they were up linked quarter. And it seemed a little bit better than what you were saying at the Investor Day. So were things a little bit better? And if so, why? I know it's not as much as you originally thought for the spring selling season. But that's a little bit of a bump and I guess you expect a little more of a bump in the third quarter. John Shrewsberry : Well, the gain was at the low end of the range which is how we thought about and described in Investor Day. In terms of volumes they were -- I think we feel about the same as we did six weeks ago which it is was less than we had originally anticipated. So we feel about the same. We are glad the results are good. They are certainly up seasonally quarter-over-quarter. But we might have imagined a little bit more going in to year. John Stumpf : Mike, about 74% of our originations are production this quarter was purchase money and that really plays into our hand. We have long-term relationships with realtors and builders. We have a wonderful crew of people who are our team members are out calling so we should expect to do better vis-\u00e0-vis because others who don't have a sales force on the ground. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. And then last question. I guess what -- I'd ask two sides of the same question. Are you taking too much risk in an area such as auto lending, where the loans are up 10% year-over-year? You have had some cautionary language from regulators, and it seems like every bank is expanding in auto lending. So are you concerned about that? On the other hand are you taking enough risk? Because based on our models which go back a couple decades, it looks like your net charge-off ratio for the firm is the lowest ever in modern history. So that would say take more risk. So where do you come out on that decision? John Stumpf : Well, Mike, you hit both side right. I mean it is I think 35 bases -- it is loss - I remember in my 37 years with the company and in the auto area specifically we looked carefully at what's going on with FICO scores and we look at delinquencies and a whole bunch of things there. So no I don't think we are taking inappropriate risks. Is that going for taking the right risks and we are finding the right place? And after all this is a business that we have been in long time and we don't come and show up and leave and secondly it is a short -dated asked that we know a lot about -- John Shrewsberry : And you probably recall at Investor Day we had a specific slide on disclosure on the growth in the auto portfolio in particular that showed among other things over a long period of time what's been going on in our portfolio with FICO scores, average loan to value and payment to income ratio of our auto customers. And each of those has improved, not only over the last five years but improved meaningfully from pre crisis levels. So the portfolio actually looks really good. Our relationship with -- and autos and our business proposition there is that we own the relationship with dealers. We banked the dealers directly, we provide them with floor plan financing, and we provide them with real estate financing. We bank them personally and we are a very reliable takeout for indirect auto paper and we get more than our fair share as a result of the paper we want and the portfolio composition reflects that. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi, thanks much. A couple questions. One is on the mortgage origination side. And I think you were doing some rollouts on July 1. Just wanted to see how those executed, and now that that's behind you, are there any opportunities to make that side of the business more efficient. John Shrewsberry : When you say rollout, do you mean changes in headcount? Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Well, there were some technology changes and some systems-related changes, process-related changes that you did effective July 1. John Stumpf : Well, Betsy, we have been doing a number of those over a period of time, be more efficient and to give our sales force more information upon sale but that's not a big issue. I mean those things happen, that haven't any impact on the business. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then just looking forward a little bit less positive on the outlook for volumes for the full year. Is there any opportunity to peel back some of the investment in the production side of the business? Or are you sticking with your current plan at this stage? John Shrewsberry : We are very flexible about that. And constantly reading what we think we need in terms of capacity. As you know, the work force in that line of business has become flexible work force just because of the ebbs and flows of origination patterns as a refinancing opportunity comes into the money and then goes away. So I think we are very real time in responding and what we think we need. And if we think that we need more because the third quarter opportunity seems bigger then we will staff it up and if we think that we need less then we will dial it back. John Stumpf : Betsy, you are on important point and I think it has been asked couple of times this morning. In the mortgage's business besides having to be good underwriter, good servicers, and all those things, good at flexibility, wrapping up and wrapping down is a core competency here. And if you are in this business and you have to be good at that. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. One other thing -- John Stumpf : No. You never know what the volumes are going to be. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Sure; no. Then one of the things you did mention at Investor Day is that Mel Watt obviously had some suggestions for underwriting and potentially changing some of the elements of the grid and I know that you had indicated that there were several meetings that you were going to be taking -- that were taking place with you and others in DC around those suggestions. Can you give us any sense as to how those dialogues have been going? Any update on how you're thinking about underwriting in the credit box? John Stumpf : Well, those meetings with our mortgage company continue with Mel Watt and his team and others. I think the goals here is to get more credit corporately to borrowers who want to own homes and who can afford homes. And that's in the interest of borrowers; it is in interest of lenders like us, and interest in investors and the country. So we are trying to harmonize that. Some things in the past created less harmony. You low rates at one side encouraging borrowing and you have put backs from the GSEs on the other side that make lenders less willing to lend money. So we are trying to get everybody on the same page. I think he has been helpful in that and obviously we are participating in that. So and as we get more clarity there we can make loans, confirming loans that serve more customers. That's the goal there. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. As I know you'd spent a lot of time with the FHA, and that at the margin helped open the credit box in certain parts. I mean do you feel like you're at the stage where we're likely to see any changes come this year? Or it's really more of a next-year event with the GSEs? John Stumpf : Well, I'll tell you predicting what happen in Washington on legislation is -- that's way above my pay scale so but the important point is here is that there are some incremental changes happening and that's helping open the credit box a bit and corporately so we are still doing full underwriting and those sort of things. But I hate to venture a guess on when GSE reform will become law. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Right. No, I was asking really more about when your credit box on GSEs would loosen up potentially versus what had happened at the FHA where you have already loosened up a little bit there so -- John Stumpf : I understand, okay. Well, we are just -- we're keep working on that and I think there is lot of emphasis on may be sure again corporate customers get loans that they can repay. John Shrewsberry : And capturing that first time buyer that lower credit quality customer may be very -- will be very important to that customer when credit becomes available but not likely to change the overarching view of what the size of the mortgage market is in 2014 or 2015. And it is not likely to have a big impact on earnings of mortgage originators. There is not that much going on there. It is very important to them but there aren't enough for those loans at 140 basis points to make a giant different. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank :  Good morning. It seems like from here the efficiency ratio will be increasingly important, just given how low the credit costs are at these levels and you talked about maybe some less reserve release going forward. So just as we think about that efficiency ratio and being closer to the higher end, is there opportunity to migrate down in this environment? And if so, how do we think about the expense opportunity versus growing revenues? John Shrewsberry : Sure. Well, we are -- I will stand out by saying we are sticking with our 55% to 59% because that's where we think we will be through the cycle. We constantly focus on our efficiency, we spend a lot of time in that many programs designed to root out and to get the bottom of the most efficient use in resources that we can have. And that's important because there are areas where we continue to spend and invest money to have the right people facing customers and investing the right product for customers. And there are also areas like risk management, compliance, technology etcetera where we are making increasing investment to build the better company for the future. So all that's going on at the same time. And it would arrive that this 55% to 59%. You can rest assure that we are doing what we can to keep expense as efficient but I wouldn't count on a big lever there moving down closer to 55% all other things being equal to drive near-term performance. John Stumpf : So couple examples of things that we are doing. As you know about since the merger five years ago we've reduced the number of square feet that we used to house our people and through our stores and so forth from 100 let say 15 or 17 million square feet to 94-95 million square feet. We are testing and successfully so a new urban store if you will, neighborhood store, we have now three of those in the Washington area, have a very different expense component but still just as productive. So there is a lots of things we are working on. So we can use those dollars and savings to invest in other areas of business that John mentioned. Expense -- there is lot of focus on that here but not -- again I have said in the past we are not slavish to it. If our expenses grow because revenues growing up, that's a good thing. And we will make the investment that we believe will make-- need to make for the long-term success of the company. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. So if I am hearing you correctly, as we think about the efficiency ratio going forward, there may be some opportunities for it to tick down a little bit, more dependent on revenue. John Stumpf : I would say yes surely, it is a ratio. So no matter it is denominator, we are working both side of it. John Shrewsberry :  And as we've said publicly in the past to the extent that we had revenue increases as a result of rates moving up. We probably migrate to the lower end of efficiency ratio because those dollars of revenue don't have expense attached to them. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank :   Okay. Yes, I'm harping on it because the efficiency ratio hasn't really moved the last several quarters. As we start thinking about the back half of the year and going forward the mortgage revenue comps get a lot easier and it feels like we could start seeing some improvement there so -- John Shrewsberry : Have you noticed that were best in class at the ratio where we currently operate? Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Understood. Fair point. Just separately on the tax rate, last quarter came in low; you called out that gain both at the time and then again today. But today's or the second-quarter tax rate seems a little bit higher than at least what we were looking for. What is the outlook? Should we pencil in the 32% going forward or --? John Shrewsberry : Yes. You said pencil today's effective rate going forward. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. and then just lastly, I had a follow-up on an earlier question. The mortgage servicing revenue that is coming from the MSR gains, that is writing up the MSR because the expenses to service the loans are coming down? John Shrewsberry : That's right. The future cash flows are higher as a result of future expenses coming down, current and future expenses coming down. Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And is there still I feels like there is still opportunity to reduce the cost of servicing going forward, which therefore would increase the value of the MSR. It feels like there is still more of that opportunity there. John Shrewsberry : There maybe. We are probably in that middle innings of perfecting servicing over time. There are still -- and more of elevated level of troubled loans out there compared to what we hope to steady status years from now. And when that happens it will be in the future and the benefit of will be the discounted than future benefit of it but you are right, it is probably opportunities at some point in future. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Keith Murray with ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Keith Murray - ISI Group : Thanks a lot. Can you spend a minute on cards? So you obviously have increased penetration impressively on the card side. Just a question : From penetration to actual usage, how long does it take? Obviously you guys have shown very solid loan growth on the card side. But how difficult, once they get a card from Wells, to get them to start using it, to move up the pecking order versus other cards? John Stumpf : This is an area that I think is one of our biggest opportunities in the company. If you look at Wells being as we all talk about in the real economy, we have leadership roles in variety of lending classes, whether autos, in consumer, small business, real estate and we are just passionate about helping our retail customers understand the value of having a Wells Fargo card and not only in their wallet but top of wallet. And there were some areas that we were under serving, especially our affluent and emerging affluent customers and our partnership with American Express is off to a very good start. Obviously, we do a lot of things, it was with VISA, and important in Master Card partners of ours. So we can sell a card to a customer at a fraction of the cost of someone else in the outside. We know these people better, we give them better products, and we have a lot of exciting benefits that we are giving as part of the card offering. And it is not only having the balances there. It's being involved with the customer on the payment side. So when we merge the two companies over five years ago, Wachovia came without a portfolio because he had sold their card business off so we are at about 22% penetration rate. Today we are at 39%. I always tell our people, do you know how many of our consumers have credit cards they all do. In fact, they have more than one card. Now, I don't know that we didn't get to 100% but we are marching smartly up the line and you are right, it is not only about the number of plastic cards we have outstanding, it is one that have been used. So I am thrilled with what we are doing. We have still lot more work to do. Big opportunity for us. John Shrewsberry : That's right. And it is both in the balances as well as interchange and utilization. John Stumpf : And it just works beautifully. Keith Murray - ISI Group : Okay. Just switching gears to OLA, you had given us your thoughts on that on Investor Day. Obviously you guys issued some long-term debt this quarter. Do you feel like you're getting close to where you're going to wind up needing to be, for OLA? Or any updated thoughts and things you're hearing from Washington on that? John Shrewsberry : I wouldn't -- there is no real updated intelligence. We still are hearing and are of a mind that the range that will probably published at some point in the future is in the high teen to low 20s in terms of loss absorption cushion. We see ourselves on a risk based approached at the low end of that range and at or within striking distance of that range. So based on everything that we know today, we don't anticipate it having material impact on Wells Fargo. Keith Murray - ISI Group :   Okay. And then just finally for me, we have read a lot about the SNC review and regulators focus on leveraged loans, etcetera. Just can you give us any thoughts related to that? And any changes you have seen this year in how the regulators are approaching it versus past years? John Shrewsberry : Well, they are talking about it lot and there is multiple regulators talking about it little differently so I think there is an effort to harmonize their points of view. But obviously they've got a big focus on what's going on with leverage lending inside of banks and banks mean different thing depending on which regulator and which firms are covering. So I would anticipate more clarity some time later this year or maybe beyond that but it really isn't enough for to understand what's going on and at some level to encourage certain types of behavior and discourage others. The big emphasis is on the most levered and most collateral free leverage lending. We don't anticipate having an extraordinary impact on Wells Fargo based on our business mix. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research :  Hi, I was wondering if I could ask about deposit growth in the rising-rate scenario. And I guess if I oversimplify the two schools of thought or the two ends of the spectrum are deposits have only shrank industry wide in 2 of the past 90 years, and those were pretty marginal declines; so you can kind of bank on industry deposits growing. And then I guess JPMorgan was pretty explicit about the other end, where they feel like some of the need to drain liquidity out of the system as rates rise could drive deposits down as much as 10%. So I know there is a lot of uncertainty. Part of it depends on how the Fed acts. But as you think about liquidity planning and stress testing you do internally, any thoughts on the range of best-case and worst-case deposit growth you think about? John Stumpf : Let me just give overall view how we think about it. I think one of the things that -- is may be under appreciated about Wells today is the quality of our deposit franchise. And we have $1.1 Trillion of deposit at 10 basis points. About a $1 Trillion of core deposits and many of these -- most of these deposits what I would call transactional mean that people use these deposits either are they are checking accounts or saving accounts, we only have 30 to 40 billion [AR] of CDs, we have a very high quality deposit base. We are also growing primary checking accounts. Think about that. The primary account by between 4.5% and 5%, lower 5% depending whether it's small business or consumer. And in fact these some of the strongest growth number we-- I have ever seen. So because of the quality of our deposit franchise, the quality of omnichannel delivery system. And no one knows of course, it will become fact in history what happens with disintermediation about when rates rise and so forth. I am of the opinion that you are going to see at least for the first couple hundred basis points move up in rate, probably very little movement in disintermediation. You can make the argument that the squeeze down your M1 and M2 and some of the liquidity about the system. We found over time as you suggest early that deposit generally grow. And it might not grow as fast as but I am very confident about how all our deposit franchise will perform in a rising rate environment. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : That's very helpful. Maybe on the student loan sale, what's your thought process on the decision to sell as opposed to I guess the alternative of just letting it gradually run down over time? Is it a capital free-up or a regulatory? Or what's the benefit of selling out of it now? John Shrewsberry : Sure. Well, we had designated -- that the government guaranteed student loan business which is distinct from our private student loan business that we are very committed to over the long term. We had separated after government guaranteed part of the portfolio into liquidating portfolio in 2010 when we stopped originating those loans as that market changed. So they have been part of our run off portfolio for that period of time and amortizing down a little bit. We see the opportunity in the market to move those loans off the book. They are relatively low yielding. They are not strategic. We don't have bigger relationships with most of those customers and that's the decision. So we have transferred them all to held for sale status to signal this intend to sell, we are going about the process in the next quarter or so. Brian Foran - Autonomous Research : If I could sneak a last one in on MSR hedging -- or I guess more specifically the line item you give of $475 million, the market-related valuation changes net of hedge results. I feel like -- I always strip that out of core EPS; I always set it at zero and then I always end up being too low. It's almost always a positive number. Is that a number that through the cycle you would expect to be kind of a wash? Or am I just missing that there is a carry component to it because of the way you structure the hedge and things like that? Through the cycle it actually -- over the past 5 years it's averaged $200 million a quarter. And there is a volatile component to it, but through the cycle it should be some positive nonzero number? John Shrewsberry : It is a carry component. The bundle of instrument that we use to hedge the asset to create the right duration profile as rates move up or down that we think the value is -- changing value is neutralized. That bundle of instruments throws out positive carry. It will depend on the shape or the slope of the yield curve at different points in time. And of course in the past it has been impacted by other expense items that have been flowing through, they are less of them today. So it is a little bit more standout in terms of its net. And then there is also the influence of what happens when rate speed up or down -- prepayment rates speed up or not, and of course we have gone through a period recently where the asset is linked-in. So there is a lot of different things going on there. And it is not currently what through the cycle actually mean in this context because as rates move you are in different places and as the shape of the curve moves you are in different places that are different than a business cycle or credit cycle. But you can look at the performance over some period of time and set whatever average you think is right. But I think zeroing it our is probably conservative. Operator : Your next question is will come from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Great, thanks. Most of my questions have actually been asked and answered. But one quick thing, that the -- you have taken a big step up in capital return. Just talk a little bit about what might influence you to go to the very high end of your range or to the lower end of your range, in subsequent periods. John Shrewsberry : So we are setting our expectations in our levels internally from one key card process to the next based on how we anticipate that we are going to earn and the negotiation if you will that we are having with regulators which -- it is part of what constructs the balance between dividend and repurchase. And if you think about an annual payout or if we thought about an annual payout based on the annual number, it would be a calculated number in that range. From quarter-to-quarter as I mentioned earlier with respect to what happen to share count, we've got different things going on with share issuance so that the net buyback will be bigger in some quarter than it is in others which is going make us look like we are dancing around inside the range. And that's the reason for moving around inside the range. Now, more importantly if growth opportunities began to emerge in a more meaningful way where we needed to retain more capital to put it work then that would also be a driver, I think Investor Day you probably recall that Paul Ackerman went through an analysis of the amount of capital that we thought was appropriate to set aside for asset growth and that's amount that was -- the amount of earnings necessary are available to distribute. So that's the starting process. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Just as a follow-up to that, any thoughts on portfolio acquisition opportunities in the current environment? Anything standing out? John Shrewsberry : I wouldn't say anything standing out. We are at there looking in both consumer and commercial and commercial real estate assets. We've -- I mentioned in the loan growth context that we have done a couple of commercial real estate acquisition. These are all announced but that have happened in the quarter. Pardon me, that is happened in previous quarters. So we are looking at those. We have talked about card programs like the Dillard's program where we will be picking up a portfolio receivable in addition to managing that card program going forward with more opportunity there. So we are looking at lots of things. Some things make more sense than others but that's an interesting way for us to add both assets and new customers to the bank. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Got you. Very last thing. Just on that up sale, just two quick questions. Do you think you will sell it in one piece, or do you think you'd break it up into pieces? And do you service that portfolio? John Shrewsberry : With respect to the first half of the question it depends, we would be willing to sell at one piece. It is a big number. So it may happen in component pieces. And on the second half, we do not service those loans. Operator :  Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Market. Please go ahead with your question. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market : Yes, thank you very much. On the mortgage production side, the $47 billion that you guys produced, how much did you sell into the MBS market, and how much did you portfolio? John Shrewsberry : I don't have that number handy. I think the lion share of that was sold. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market : Okay. Do you have handy with you what was jumbo? John Shrewsberry : About $8 billion, nonconforming mortgages increased $8 billion to about $96 billion. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market : Then my guess is you put portfolioed all those nonconforming jumbos. John Shrewsberry : That's correct. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market :   Go ahead. John Shrewsberry : The question is whether that $8 billion is part of the $47 billion because if it then that answers the question at what we sold. So we will confirm that. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market :   Okay. That makes sense given the MBS issuance data that has been out. I don't have June; but given May and July I think you probably issued probably somewhere between 33 and 35, so that would coincide with some of that. Have you been portfolioing any conforming loans on your residential portfolio? Or has it just been nonconforming jumbos? John Shrewsberry : Nonconforming, not portfolio conforming. Paul Miller - FBR Capital Market : Yes. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing of the jumbos? Are they 4.25%, 4.5%? Are they mainly 7/1, 10/1s? Are you portfolioing any 30-year? John Shrewsberry : So it's a mix 5/1, 7/1, 10/1 and 30 year and they are priced for their point on the curve. Operator : Your next will come from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Mutascio - KBW: Good morning, John. John, how are you? As a happy Wells Fargo deposit customer, I got a letter in the mail several weeks ago, and I wanted to get your thoughts on it. It was changing the overdraft, no longer going from processing it from a high to low but going now to first received. I thought that already happened. I guess I was wrong. So I guess my question is : Will this have an impact on deposit service charges going forward with the change in the overdraft processing? John Stumpf : It is not going to be meaningful, no. Chris Mutascio - KBW: Okay. But has it happened in certain parts of the country? Because I'm here in Baltimore, Maryland; I thought it was the old Wachovia franchise. Has it happened in certain parts of the country? In other words the shift to first received and now we are converting other parts of the country? Or this is throughout the whole franchise? John Stumpf : Repeat that one. This is really as a process we are able to with debit; we are able to do it on a real time basis. And it was more incorporating that into that hierarchy with checks to get them synchronized and that was the reason for making that change. Chris Mutascio - KBW:   Okay. So again but the end result of that, this isn't any impact to deposit service charges going forward? John Stumpf : It is not to be meaningful. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead with your question. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Good morning, guys. A question about the spring survey from the OCC, where they made some fairly pointed comments about deterioration in credit quality, not only in leveraged lending. I think there was sort of a loosening of loan standards; I mean, there were a whole bunch of bullet points that were somewhat alarming from a credit-quality standpoint. Do you guys see that this is at an inflection point in credit quality? And do you feel or are you feeling increased pressure to maybe start building reserves rather than continuing to let them draw down? John Shrewsberry : So at least two different questions there. The first part on the competitive environment for loan. And it is a more competitive environment. There are lots of people out there. Lots of banks out there with a lot of liquidity competing for loans. And we do see more competitive -- more borrower friendly structures that we have to react to from one asset category to another. Now in some like in mortgage for example, part of it is just getting more clarity on what the rules are and what's going to work and what's saleable to agencies and things like that. And for other things -- for other types of assets, we mentioned auto earlier, there are people out there who for example are extending the terms on auto loans, so links that you might not seen in past. And of course we are all leverage lending is probably the most visible because it's pretty easy to measure the aggressiveness based on leverage multiple for example. So those things are happening. Our front line and relationship managers and others are confronted with having to make decisions about where we want to be in, where we don't want to be. We think we are very good at spotting that. And managing credit risk has been strength at Wells Fargo as you know for a very long time. With respect to reserving, we are looking at our risk allowance for credit losses every quarter and it reflects and its change reflects what's going on in the portfolio. When its bottom up analysis of what's in the portfolio, what it looks like, what's risk rated, how it is performing and what our expectations is for near term credit losses. And as we said here, we anticipate reserve releases declining over some period of time in part to reflect -- from 35 basis points it's hard to argue that whether it can get much better from there or sort of bounded by zero on the one side and would expect to gravitate more towards some whatever normalized means with some higher level of net charge-off. So that's going on the one hand and then there is portfolio growth. As we said, we had a lot of new loans put on and all things being equal at some point, our reserves will have to grow to reflect the increased loan balances which we think is a great thing because we want those loans on the books serving customers, earning interest and creating the environment to cross sell those customers. That's how I see them. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Do you think you will have an ability to telegraph the change that will actually happen when you have to start building reserves? Because my guess is that the industry is going to be -- or Wall Street is going to be somewhat shocked when that starts to happen. John Shrewsberry : As I look at the industry data so what's going on with reserve releases from other banks, they have been trending and it begun to trend with a few exceptions back up towards zero. So I think people see that coming and it's a reflection of asset growth on one hand which is a good thing and then of course the big reserves that we put on at the -- in the heat of the crisis that in some cases were more than relative what was necessary. So we look at quarter-by-quarter, just to be clear, this is a gap exercise, we built it up based on what's actually in the portfolio and the experience that we are managing. As you have seen in the data right now our allowance for credit loss is pushing 5x what our actual charge-off experience is right now. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore. Please go ahead with your question. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners : Good morning, guys. Thanks. Just a couple follow-ups here. Just to be clear on the line of questioning from Nancy on credit quality, so just looking -- it feels like, to your point, maybe it's hard to get much better than 35 basis points in aggregate and recovery seem to be less robust and maybe it's a very modest uptick in C&I. Like, how should we think about the level? I mean, should we think about it in this very low range for a period of time, and we're still very far from what you've previously deemed as normalized, the 75 to 85 basis points? How should we think about maybe that near-term? John Shrewsberry :  I think it's going to be hard for the 35 basis points to move rapidly to any much higher number. And we know what kind of assets we have been putting on the book for the last few years which I think we all believe are very high credit quality particularly on a historical basis. So normalization will happen over some period of time but at least from our perspective we wouldn't expect it to be an abrupt move. Credit is still quite strong. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners : Got it. Then just a little ticky-tack on the reserving. So not only for the loan growth that's picking up and relief from legacy issues for the industry, there is also this upcoming change in accounting at some point. Any update or thoughts on the CECL coming through, and when one might need to start thinking about that for the industry in general? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So what we know about that is that it sounds like it is going to happen. It is not final but we are going to be hearing about it from the Fed in the coming quarters. And at least the way I read it there is not going to be much of an opportunity to change anyone's mind. But of course for anybody who is included into this, this is life of low-- essentially life of loan reserving. The expectation, our expectation is that would begin to phase in the 2017 timeframe or later. And so it's not really today's issue and just for the avoidance of doubt, our reserving practices today do not reflect that future contemplated life of reserving -- life of loan loss approach. So it's out there, let's call it 2017 plus and something wrong and have to figure out how to adapt to. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners : Great, that's helpful. Then lastly just following on the balance sheet dynamic questions and the NIM optics and issues around deposits. Can you maybe just re-clarify in terms of deposit velocity in a higher rate environment that Brian had brought up earlier? How much -- I mean, do you if at all consider ring-fencing 5%, 10%, 15% of deposits maybe at risk of reversing in a higher rate environment as some institutions have indicated? John Shrewsberry : I wouldn't say that we don't describe it in our deposit stress testing internally in quite that way. And we talk about the types of deposit accounts that we have and we assigned what we think are the right level of behaviors to those accounts and through that we assess what we think the right level of liquidity is to carry and that liquidity comes in the form both of cash and cash equivalent which are extraordinary at Wells Fargo today as well as our securities are relatively liquid securities portfolio that we in a pinch would consider to be saleable or financeable. And answering a slightly different question, the sum of those two things is such a significant part of our balance sheet today that it seems like ample coverage for whatever portion of deposits might be -- might unexpected retract or disappear in the event of move up. John Stumpf : And I think as I mentioned before I think we are going -- our deposit franchise will out perform competitors because of the nature of the kind of deposits we have and the amount of core deposits (inaudible) amount of retail core and I think there is going to be surprise, I think we will surprise ourselves and how well it's going to do. John Shrewsberry : That's right. We have the relationships that we have with our deposit customers is cemented by the tools that we have that we use, that the products that we offer them and allow them to manage their money. So whether it's a consumer or a business customer, we've got the best in class interface that allows them -- and frankly it is hard to move away from -- in terms of moving money, analyzing money, investing money etcetera, the mobile convenience, the online convenience what we have referred to as this omnichannel relationship. It's not easy or convenient to want to change that. So something really has to be compelling about an individual depositor circumstances or we would have to really be tone deaf to what deposit pricing needs to do in order to retain our balances. So we feel really good about that. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners : Thanks, that's helpful. Then if you don't mind, just in terms of -- you've mentioned a couple quarters now how you've had this great continued growth in core deposits. But it's optically impacted the NIM but hasn't really negatively impacted the NII. Would a similar dynamic be envisioned in a higher rate environment if in fact the velocity was greater than one envisioned? In terms of it could go the other way and you could have an optically better net interest margin; but the NII could remain relatively stable despite all that. Or how should we think about that? Or how do you think about that? John Stumpf : What's happened in the past is typically what happen is that the margin will increase and net interest income increase because assets have reprised faster than liabilities will. So I mean \u2013 hypothetically we will wait to see what happens at that time. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore Partners :   Got it, great, thank you, guys. John Stumpf : All right. Well, thank you much everybody. We appreciate your interest in Wells Fargo. Thank you for joining the call. Excellent questions and we will see you next quarter. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all participating. And you may now disconnect.",

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference. Jim Rowe : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf. John Stumpf : Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our strong results in the third quarter reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and were driven by our continued focus on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs in the real economy. Let me highlight our growth during the third quarter compared with a year ago. We generated earnings of $5.7 billion and earnings per share of $1.02, both up 3%. We grew net interest income and non-interest income, resulting in 4% revenue growth; and our efficiency ratio improved to 57.7%. Pretax pre-provision profit increased 7%. We had strong broad-based loan growth with our core loan portfolio up almost $51 billion or 7%. Our credit performance continued to be excellent with the net charge-off ratio declining to only 32 basis points on average loans on an annualized basis. We had a $300 million reserve release this quarter, down from $900 million a year ago. In fact in my 32 plus years with the company, I have not seen credit better. Our deposit franchise continued to generate strong customer and balance growth with total deposits up $89 billion or 9%. We grew primary consumer checking customers by 4.9% and primary small business and business checking customers by 5.6%. This level of business performance has enabled us to maintain strong capital levels even while returning more capital to our shareholders through a higher dividends and share repurchases. We returned a net $3.6 billion to our shareholders in the third quarter, up 29% from a year ago. Before I turn it over to John Shrewsberry, our CFO, I\u2019d like to take a minute or two and share some of my thoughts on the economy and the housing market. While the path to a full economic recovery remains uneven, including the volatility we\u2019ve seen recently and the current low rate environment provides some challenges, I am very optimistic about the future. The U.S. economy added 248,000 jobs last month, the 48 straight monthly employment gain tying the record for the longest consecutive string of job gains ever. There are currently more job openings than at any time since early 2001. Household wealth is at an all-time high and after years of paying down debt, the consumer debt burden is at the lowest level in over 30 years. Consumers are now better positioned for increased spending and borrowing. The U.S. economy is also benefiting from the increasing domestic oil and gas productions, which is at the highest level in almost 30 years and rising fast, up 14% over the past year. Fiscal conditions have improved at all levels of government, and government payrolls are once again on the rise for the first time this decade. Historically, most recoveries in this country have been led by housing. While the residential real estate market has definitely gotten better, which is good for the U.S. economy, it has not fully recovered. I believe there are several factors holding the housing market back from a complete recovery. First, household formation is slower than it has been in the past. Second, national student debt balances have increased leading less money available to pay for our mortgage. Third, in some markets, inventory is not available especially in coastal areas. Finally, credit is still not obtainable for all qualified borrowers due in part to the credit overlays that many mortgage lenders, including Wells Fargo use to help reduce repurchase risk. Despite these challenges, a recent survey we conducted showed that home ownership is still an aspiration for 95% of respondents. Home prices are up 7% over the past year and I believe the housing market will continue its recovery driven by pent-up demand and affordability that even with the increase in home prices is still far better than the historical average. These trends are all positive for our country, our customers, our shareholders, as well as Wells Fargo and we continue our service to the real economy. Now John Shrewsberry, CFO will provide more details on our third quarter results. John? John Shrewsberry : Thanks John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplements starting on page two. John and I will then answer your questions. Wells Fargo had another strong quarter earning $5.7 billion and growing EPS to $1.02. Generating this level of consistent earnings while economic growth has been uneven and interest rates have remained low, demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model. We grew both revenue and pre-tax, pre-provision profit from second quarter and have grown pretax pre-provision profit for four consecutive quarters. Our results also reflected solid loan and deposit growth that was diversified across our businesses. Our capital levels remained strong even as we returned $3.6 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. As John highlighted and as you can see on page three, we had strong year-over-year growth across a number of important business drivers. We grew net interest income amidst the persistent low rate environment with strong earning asset growth; and our ability to grow non-interest income by $542 million or 6% from a year ago even as mortgage originations declined by 40%, demonstrates the benefit of our diversified sources of fee income. Page four highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. We have over 90 businesses and in any given quarter, some will drive more revenue growth than others. For example, the strength in the markets over the past few years has benefited our market sensitive businesses. Market sensitive revenue was 5% of our total revenue in the third quarter, up from 4% in the second quarter but lower than the 7% contribution in the first quarter. Let me highlight some key drivers of our third quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on page five. Our balance sheet has never been stronger; we\u2019ve increased our liquidity position, improved the quality of our assets and hold more capital. Furthermore, while we\u2019re positioned to benefit from rising rates, we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong results if rates remain low. Investment securities increased $9.9 billion from the second quarter with $25 billion of purchases partially offset by run-off. We issue $16.3 billion of liquidity related long-term debt as well as some additional liquidity related short-term funding during the third quarter. We are now solidly over 100% for the LCR, but keep in mind that the LCR is a minimum requirement. We have a significant amount of cash available to deploy, both to meet our customers\u2019 financial needs and to opportunistically purchase high quality assets. Turning to the income statement on page six, revenue grew $147 million during the quarter with growth in net interest income and stable non-interest income. I will highlight the drivers of revenue growth in more detail later, but let me take a moment now to highlight the growth in market sensitive revenue which increased $231 million from second quarter. Net gains from debt securities were up $182 million as we sold securities, primarily non-agency MBS as part of our ongoing balance sheet management. Net gains from equity investments were up $263 million from second quarter, reflecting strong results in our venture capital businesses, but were down a $135 million from first quarter. We\u2019ve been in these core businesses for decades and results are naturally cyclical and driven by market conditions. Non-controlling interest reduces the impact of the equity gains to our net income and increased $166 million from second quarter. The increase in market sensitive revenue from debt and equity gains was partially offset by $214 million of lower trading gains, the decline in trading reflected $163 million of lower deferred compensation plan investment results which was offset in employee benefits expense and lower customer accommodation trading. Our results this quarter also reflected $227 million of lower income tax expense from the second quarter, reflecting tax benefits primarily due to charitable donations of appreciated securities. As shown on page seven, we continued to have strong broad-based loan growth in the third quarter, our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core portfolio grew by $50.8 billion or 7% from a year ago and was up $12.2 billion or 6% annualized from the second quarter. Our liquidating portfolio was down $21 billion from a year ago and is now only 8% of our total loans, down from 10% a year ago. Average loan yields have remained relatively stable over the past year and were up one basis point from second quarter. On page eight, we highlighted a number of our loan portfolios that had strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up $23.8 billion or 13% from a year ago with diversified growth that I\u2019ll highlight on the next page. We\u2019re the largest commercial real-estate lender in the country and we\u2019re benefiting from the growth in new construction. Our commercial real-estate portfolio grew $3.1 billion from a year ago. Foreign loans grew $700 million or 2% from a year ago, reflecting growth in trade finance and the UK commercial real-estate acquisition we completed in the third quarter of last year. Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $16.4 billion or 9% from a year ago with growth in high quality non-conforming mortgages, primarily jumbo loans. The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio was outstanding with only seven basis points of loss in the third quarter. We\u2019re the number one auto lender in the country. Auto loans were up $5.5 billion or 11% from last year, reflecting strong originations. Credit card balances were up $2.8 million or 11% from a year ago, benefiting from continued account growth. Slide nine demonstrates the diversity of the businesses that contributed to the growth in C&I loans; let me highlight just a few. Asset-backed finance increased $5.3 billion with increased utilization and new originations across all asset classes. Corporate banking grew $4.4 billion, driven by new customer growth and higher utilization rates from existing customers. And commercial banking serving our middle market customers grew $3.8 billion with diversified growth across geographies and industries. As you can see on page 10, average deposits totaled $1.1 trillion in the third quarter, up $25.6 billion from second quarter with growth in both commercial and consumer balances. Due to our outstanding deposit franchise, we\u2019ve been able to grow deposits over 5% on a year-over-year basis every quarter since the third quarter of 2011. Our primary consumer checking customers were up 4.9% from a year ago and we grew primary small business and business banking checking customers by 5.6%. Our average deposit costs were 10 basis points in the third quarter, consistent with second quarter and 2 basis points lower than a year ago. Our NIM declined 9 basis points from the second quarter, 4 basis points of this decline was from strong customer driven deposit growth because excess deposits remain invested in cash equivalents in the current environment. Deposit growth put pressure on the NIM, but was basically neutral to net interest income. Liquidity-related actions both term deposits and long-term debt also diluted the margin by 4 basis points. The impact of all other balance sheet growth and reprising was again minimal this quarter, reducing the margin by one basis point. Despite the decline in the net interest margin, we continue to grow net interest income on a tax equivalent basis, up $147 million from the second quarter as a result of the growth in earning assets, higher PCI accretion and one additional day in the quarter. Our balance sheet is asset-sensitive, so we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from higher rates, but we\u2019re not relying on rates to increase in order to generate growth. As we have demonstrated in this historically low rate environment, we believe we can grow net interest income overtime even if rates remain low. While total non-interest income was unchanged from the second quarter, we had growth across a number of business drivers including deposit service charges, retail brokerage, trust and investment management, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage and the market-sensitive revenue that I highlighted earlier. This growth was offset by lower investment banking fees, which declined 24% from second quarter consistent with the decline in the market people [ph]. Insurance was down $65 million reflecting the impact from the sale of 40 offices last quarter and also seasonality in the crop insurance business. Other non-interest income was down $95 million from second quarter, which had included the gain from the sale of the insurance offices. Mortgage banking revenue declined $90 million from second quarter. Mortgage origination gains were up $266 million from last quarter primarily due to gain on sale margins increasing to 182 basis points and higher mortgage repurchase reserve release. The majority of our originations were tied to purchase activity, 70% originations in the third quarter, up from 59% a year ago. We currently expect originations to be down in the fourth quarter reflecting normal seasonality in the purchase market. Servicing income declined $356 million from second quarter; approximately one-half of this decline was from higher unreimbursed direct servicing products, which reduced gross servicing fee. The rest of the decline was driven by lower net mortgage servicing rights results reflecting lower carry and hedging gains. Our gain on sale margin is expected to remain within the range we\u2019ve seen over the past four quarters. As shown on page 13, expenses were up $54 million from second quarter, while our efficiency ratio improved to 57.7%. We\u2019ve consistently worked to improving our efficiency which has enabled us to maintain a high level of customer service, while we\u2019ve continue to appropriately invest in our businesses. We\u2019ve been significantly increasing our investments in our already strong risk management practices. Our quarterly expenses related to risk and compliance have increased by approximately $100 million over the past year and we\u2019ve added over 1,500 team members in this area. Additionally, operating losses in the third quarter were $417 million, primarily reflecting litigation accruals. We expect our efficiency ratio will remain within our target range of 55% to 59% in the fourth quarter. Turning to our business segments starting on page 14, community banking earned $3.5 billion in the third quarter, up 4% from a year ago and up 1% from second quarter. By consistently providing outstanding customer service with the convenience of the most extensive store network in the country, an award winning mobile and online banking, we\u2019ve had strong net household growth. In fact, August was our strongest month for net retail bank household growth in over three years. These additional households will help drive our future growth as we focus on offering customers the products and services they need to help them succeed financially. Our results continued to benefit from growth in our debit and credit card business. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago driven by primary checking customer growth and increased usage from existing customers. Credit card purchase volume grew 16% from a year ago. We\u2019ve continued to increase our credit card penetration rate growing from 36% a year ago to 39.7% and our new customers are spending more and transacting at a greater frequency. By consistently focus on meeting the financial needs of our small business customers, Wells Fargo has been America\u2019s number one lender to small businesses for 12 consecutive years. We do business with 1 in 10 small businesses and grew primary business checking customers by 5.6% from a year ago. Wholesale banking earned $1.9 billion in the third quarter, down 3% from a year ago and 2% from second quarter. While earnings were down, there were number of underlying trends that demonstrated business momentum. Loan growth remained strong, up $28.8 billion or 10% from a year ago with growth across many businesses as I highlighted earlier. Credit quality remained outstanding with seven consecutive quarters of net recoveries. Deposit growth was also strong with average core deposits of $43.1 billion or 18% from a year ago with diversified growth across wholesale businesses. Wholesale banking cross-sell increased to 7.2 products per relationship, up from 7.0 a year ago. And treasury management grew revenue by 9% from a year ago, reflecting new product sales and re-pricing. Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $550 million in the third quarter, up 22% from a year ago and 1% from second quarter. Year-over-year results were driven by strong revenue growth up 7% with increases in both net interest income and non-interest income. Asset-based fees increased 18% from a year ago, reflecting increased market valuation and net flows. WBR results continue to benefit from strong loan growth, up 13% from a year ago driven by growth in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security-based lending. This was WBR\u2019s fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Turning to page 17, credit quality continued to improve with charge-offs at historic lows. Our new charge-off ratio declined to just 32 basis points with average loans; consumer losses were 62 basis points and commercial loans had a net recovery of two basis points. The improvement in our asset quality reflected the benefit of the improving economy and our continued focus on originating high quality loans. For example, approximately 57% of the consumer first mortgage portfolio was originated after 2008 when new underwriting standards were implemented. Non-performing assets have declined for eight consecutive quarters and were down $406 million from second quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $607 million while foreclosed assets increased $201 million driven by higher government ensured or guaranteed properties, primarily in judicial states. The reserve release was $300 million in the third quarter, down $200 million from the second quarter and down $600 million from a year ago. We continue to expect future reserve releases absent a significant deterioration in the economy but expect a lower level of future releases as the rate of credit improvement slows and the loan portfolio continues to grow. Our capital level has remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach fully phased in at 10.46% in the third quarter. While the amount of RWA we determined under the standardized and advanced approaches has been converging, our ratio this quarter was determined under the advanced approach because RWA under the advanced approach was higher. As shown on slide 19, our strong capital levels have allowed us to return more capital to our shareholders. We returned $3.6 billion to shareholders in the third quarter and our net payout ratio is 66% in the third quarter within our target range of 55% to 75%. Our common shares outstanding declined by 34.9 million shares in the quarter, the largest decline in over six years. We purchased 48.7 million common shares and entered into a $1 billion forward repurchase contract that\u2019s expected to settle in the fourth quarter for approximately 19.8 million shares. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 58.7 million shares from a year ago and expect further reductions in the fourth quarter. In summary, our results in the third quarter reflect the benefit of our diversified business model which has enabled us to produce strong and consistent results over a variety of economic and interest rate environments. Our results were driven by strong loan and deposit growth, and we grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profits. We increased our capital levels and returned more capital to shareholders. We continued to execute against all of the targets we established at Investor Day operating within our stated ranges for ROA, ROE, efficiency ratio and capital return. Our balance sheet has never been stronger reflecting higher capital liquidity levels and improved asset quality. While we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from increased economic activity and higher rates, as we\u2019ve demonstrated by our consistent financial performance in a variety of environments, we\u2019re not depending on the economy improving or rate rising to generate strong results. I\u2019m optimistic about our future opportunities as we continue to focus on serving customers and growing relationships. I will now open up the call to questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, good morning. John Stumpf : Good morning. John Shrewsberry : Good morning. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : John, my first question is on the net interest income and net interest margin. We hear you loud and clear in terms of the message with regards to the NII trajectory. As we think about the net interest margin going forward given the stability of your loan yield over the past three quarters and your funding cost also stable over the past three quarters. Is really there is the incremental hit on the margin in this rate environment really going to come from deposit flow given that you did issued $16 billion in debt in the quarter for liquidity purposes already? John Stumpf : So that\u2019s probably true and it also has a lot to do with what we choose to do with the access deposits or frankly access funding as it sits on our balance sheet. We\u2019re making choices between leaving that liquidity in cash equivalents setting at the Fed or deploying it in the HQLA or loans for that matter if there enough demand for it or other assets with yields. And we\u2019re making those determinations based on how we feel about entry points in the market and what we think it does to our capital sensitivity in the event of a backup subsequently and it\u2019s those types of choices that are going to drive us to increase the all-in yield on the west side of the balance sheet, whether the funding is coming from deposits or from term funding. Erika Najarian - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch : Got it. And my second question is given Governor Tarullo\u2019s speech early in the September, there are clearly two ruling issues where the industry that may not be as relevant to Wells. Higher CET 1 buffers relative to your short-term funding base and also the interpretation of NSSR by over rules by Basel. Do you see advantage given where you are on both the business mix and capital spectrum to perhaps take advantage of players that need to have more stringent buffers mainly in terms of continuing to grow market share in wholesale banking? John Stumpf : It\u2019s possible. On both of the measures we think we end up at the low-end of the risk-adjusted spectrum in terms of the bad outcomes that occur. And that might give us an opportunity to do a little bit more for our customers if they needed and if the risk-adjusted returns are appropriate. I think that the -- we\u2019re all waiting to see what happens to the returns in those businesses based on the actions taken by people who are constrained by both of those -- who are more constrained by both of those new ratios. What it means for pricing, what it means for our customer behavior et cetera. But we\u2019re happy with the approach that we\u2019ve taken and we\u2019re here to serve the customers that we have. And, but you are right, we\u2019re probably at the more advantaged end of the spectrum with respect to both of those measures. John Shrewsberry :  Yes. Erika I said, to add to that, nothing that\u2019s happening to-date and nothing that we see in the horizon will allow will get in our way or impede our way to help customers and to serve them. And I think that puts us in a very good position. Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, I\u2019ll step-off. Thank you for taking my questions. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Hi, good morning. John Stumpf : Hi. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: John I appreciate your color on reminding us about that minority interest back out on some of the trading related activities. But just wondering if you can help us understand from those portfolios that still generate a healthy amount of fee income, what\u2019s kind of left in it still there if you think across net gains from trading activities debt securities and net gains from equity investment sort of question that comes up frequently with the investment community? John Stumpf : Sure. Well, there are variety of different businesses that contribute to those results. So the big drivers would be our -- the venture activity that we have, the Norwest Venture Partners, it would be the activity of investment banking where we\u2019ve got customer combination trading. It\u2019s the impact of the hedging that we do for our deferred comp program and then there is, at least in this quarter and probably in future quarters some amount of balance sheet management on the debt portfolio. And they all contribute. So it\u2019s a diversified set of investments, different drivers in each case, some of them are more sensitive to where we are in the rate cycles, some of them are more sensitive to where we are in the equity valuation cycle. But they\u2019ve contributed more or less you\u2019ll call it 4%, 5% to 7% or 8% over a number of quarters. And there isn\u2019t one thing that I would hang on, I\u2019d think of them as being core to our business results in different ways, but over the long-term. John Shrewsberry : Ken? And John mentioned that within those business decades, actually a lot of decades, 50 years, so this with respect to venture and equity partners, so these are long term businesses for us. Ken Usdin - Jefferies:  Yes. And I think that\u2019s the point which is that you don\u2019t see any growth coming as far as the ability to continue to realize either gains or benefits from those activities and there is some countercyclical pieces within it as well? John Stumpf : They are part of what\u2019s a broader set of diversified non-interest income whatever it is. So whether they\u2019re contributing 4% or 7% as it has been in recent history and how they work in sync with all of the other things that are going on in terms of customer facing fee generating activity that is the diversified model. And as I mentioned, some of them are more interest rate sensitive and were in a low rate environment, so there is higher unrealized gains. Some of them are levered to equity markets and exit strategies for portfolio investments. But I would think of them as part of the broader mix of diversified non-interest income sources. Ken Usdin - Jefferies:  Understood. And my next question is just on the expense side, understanding that you\u2019re going to still be living in this some 55%, 59% range, we did see kind of flattish fee side, a little bit NII growth but then a little bit of higher expenses as well. And I\u2019m just wondering as you think about that level of expenses and continue to manage forward in what\u2019s still looking to be a pretty tough rate environment and these ongoing challenges from NIM pressures, any adjustments that you\u2019re thinking about or contemplating as far as just kind of the need to continue to manage that expense base even tighter than you\u2019ve already been and where would opportunities be so? John Stumpf :  We\u2019re always trying to be as efficient as we can to make sure that we have the resources available to deliver what customers need. And of course as we\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019re at a time when the focus in the investment, in the risk management area is very high. So we\u2019re working constantly to try and be as efficient as we can and in areas where it won\u2019t impact customers and where it doesn\u2019t hinder us in terms of our risk management activity. Some examples, which we\u2019ve talked about a little bit before are really in other areas, for example the space that we consume, the way we think about our purchasing, the technology that we use et cetera. We can always be a little bit more efficient. And it\u2019s a constant job here to try and make the most of that. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: But you guys haven\u2019t felt that incremental compliance burden increasing to a level where you feel the need to pull the continuous improvement cord? John Stumpf : I think we are pulling the continuous improvement cord and in part, because we\u2019re spending more in compliance and risk management, like we\u2019re spending more in our -- in the customer experience and our customer facing activity. But in order to afford both of those things, we have to be really vigilant around the business as usual expenses; and that\u2019s continuous improvement. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Understood, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Hi, good morning. John, question on the mortgage revenues; on the servicing side, the growth servicing revenues are down about 200 million, you mentioned the unreimbursed servicing costs. Is that for your one-timers that the pop-up and those, it seems like those were coming down from a while and then they\u2019ve kind of reversed this quarter, that just bounced around or any color you can give on that? John Stumpf : It had come down; it bounced back up. Our sense is that trajectory is going to be reduced over the longer ark of the mortgage servicing cycle; it\u2019s going to be hard to forecast it quarter-to-quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t expect it as low as it\u2019s been for the last couple of quarters, this maybe a more average quarter. And over some period of time as the level of non-performing loans, foreclosed assets et cetera begins to abate then you\u2019d expect that to raced itself down, but this is probably a relatively normal level. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And in terms of capital on the advanced approach, you mentioned the RWA kind of ratio to total assets seems like it got a little better on better credit quality and data refinements. Any more color on that? Is that something that also just kind of bounces around quarter-to-quarter or we still have some model improvements you can do from here? John Stumpf : There is always more that we can do with improved and more focus on data and modeling. But you could come to a point where just because of the nature of our assets, loans and securities that attract the risk weights that they do that were constrained on the standardized side. So, and we mentioned that they are converging, they are very close together right now in terms of the RWA calculation. But the takeaway is that our capital level did increase a little bit in the quarter under the advanced approach. And in spite of that, we\u2019re still earning north of 13% as an ROA, which we\u2019re very proud of. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : And that stuff that just rolled off in terms of the better credit-quality like older assets that roll off, is that why it\u2019s getting better? John Stumpf : It\u2019s a combination of roll off and hard work around data and modeling and continuous refinement. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : And with that ratio at 10.46 is this the kind of level that you want to run at on Tier 1 common? John Stumpf : Tough to say. As we said in Investor Day, this is probably in excess of the buffer that we might have imagined when we originally vectored in toward our regulatory capital levels. And it\u2019s really a function of CCAR and some of the assumptions that are made in the CCAR process as it is applied. So as we go from CCAR to CCAR and we present our starting capital point, we present our expected capital generation and our capital actions and what they yield in terms of capital levels, we\u2019re trying to manage that as appropriately as we can to got the right amount of return back to shareholders, which we believe that we\u2019ve done at a 66% payout ratio. But it\u2019s an art form because of all of the inputs and the other actors in the process. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And just a quick follow-up to Erika\u2019s question on the liquidity building, it sounds like you\u2019re now above the minimums of your calculations, but you might decide to build some buffer going forward, so we might expect a little bit more on that front from you? John Stumpf : So I think we\u2019re in a period where big banks are trying to figure out what the right buffer is as a result of our own internal stress testing and the expectations on G-SIBs in particular. So we\u2019re in the phase. We feel great about where we are right now. Nobody has mentioned [deal lack] yet, but there is some work to do to figure out where we\u2019re going on that front and how that -- what the interplay is between liquidity we\u2019ve already built and what future requirements are going to be. So I think that heavy lifting is probably behind us for the time being. But I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re stopped. John Shrewsberry : And John, one of the strengths of the company of course is our continued ability to grow high quality, low cost core deposits, which is critical in all of this. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay, great. Thanks guys. John Stumpf : Thanks John. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Hey guys. John Stumpf : Hey Matt. John Shrewsberry : Hey Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Just wanted to open some of the rate related questions earlier, this was not a Wells specific issue, but you are the first of kind of the original banks to come out. If the tenure does stay, right now it\u2019s sitting at 2 to 2.2, my screen shows. Is this meaningful as we think about I guess, both the NIM and then could there be some opportunities on refis if we stay down here for a little bit? John Shrewsberry : I don\u2019t know if that gets us back in the money refi scenario, but probably still some distance away from that. I think that it is meaningful than it\u2019s more about the expectation that how long rates stay low because that will influence the decision to redeploy cash equivalents into assets with duration. And if you imagine that term rates are going to back up in the foreseeable future, just from a capital preservation perspective, you\u2019re probably less likely to redeploy out of cash and into higher earning assets. And so that\u2019s the calculus and the judgment that we make here relatively regularly and it feels frankly like the market is now discounting the idea that there is any sort of meaningful move up in rates in the 2015 timeframe. So if we\u2019re going to be lower for longer, I think it means a lot for banks like ours and it could mean you have to be that much more vigilant on expenses. I think it means you have to think about how your assets are deployed and how much cash you think you really need to carry. And we\u2019ll be conducting that balance between the risk to capital if rates back up and the risk to earnings if rates stay low or underinvested. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then I guess a somewhat related theme spread pressure in the commercial lending business. We saw your yields down about 10 bps quarter-to-quarter. And I guess there is two phenomenon that\u2019s going on. One, the new loans that you\u2019re adding at lower spreads just generally speaking for the industry but then maybe some loans that you did a few years ago are coming up for renewal and there is some de-pricing there. Maybe just talk about like which of those two is a bigger driver at this point, how should we think about other dynamics in that book? John Stumpf : I don\u2019t know which of those two drove the 10 basis-point drop in this quarter or who was a greater contributor to that drop in this quarter. It is a competitive environment out there. We\u2019re happy to be able to have a full toolkit when we square off with our commercial customers because we\u2019re in a position to earn more of their business and to generate more of a return on the risk capital that\u2019s associated with the loan that we\u2019re going to make. We contrast ourselves with some other firms that we compete with who are getting paid primarily from the loan yield itself enough from the broader relationship. So we like our competitive stance in that range. We have backed away from the table in some situations, not so much on price, but where we see credit or terms getting a little bit frothy, because that\u2019s another lever that people pull in order to compete for these types of assets. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Any signs of stabilization in that spread or just still in (inaudible)? John Stumpf : I think at some level, it\u2019s got to be stabilized by the marginal player who is only getting a return from the asset itself, because there are levels below which they can\u2019t go, because they\u2019re not going to generate a sufficient return on capital. And they have no other cards to play in terms of generating relationship returns by providing product or service. And some of the smaller banks who participate in those markets would be examples of that. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. John Stumpf : Hello Joe. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks. Good morning John and John. John Shrewsberry : Hey, Joe. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : I guess looking at your new C&I slide on page nine, how much of your growth do you think is coming from market share gains as opposed to increased demand? And along those lines, last quarter you talked about seeing increased confidence among business owners. Is that still the case generally? John Stumpf : Well, speaking for market share gains, it depends on which column in that slide you\u2019re talking about. We have leading market share and our increasing share in some of those businesses; and some of them, they might include examples of businesses where we\u2019ve chosen to slow down a little bit, if the competition\u2019s got racy. So it\u2019s a combination of things, of both market share growth and of the size of the market increasing. So, Joe, if you look at more than just commercial customers broadly, there has actually been fairly good activity, now there has been volatility lately in the market, but if you look auto sales and we participate in that business of course, August was the biggest sales month, maybe in I don\u2019t know how many years. Consumers, our credit card activities are increasing. We\u2019re doing -- we had growth in our mortgage portfolio. So, it\u2019s very broad-based. And when I\u2019m out calling customers, corporate customers, middle-market customers, there seems to be more -- at least more discussion about activity. And the marketplace is not totally ubiquitous; there is places that are stronger, and energy for example and those places are really doing well; [Agus] having a pretty good year; technology. It depends on what part the requirement is. But core I see and I hear more optimism than I heard a year ago for example. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. I guess lastly just can you share with us any thoughts on Apple Pay and how readily you see it being adopted and what sort of impact it may have on the broader payments business? John Stumpf : Yes, as you know, we are participating in that. And there are I think 7 million to 8 million [terminals] merchants out of the marketplace and only a few hundred thousand have the NFC chip in them and that you need that the near field communication chip. So, this will take, there will be an adoption but we\u2019re pleased and excited on behalf of our customers to participate in that. And it will evolve over time. Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Thanks so much. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hi, good morning. John Stumpf : Good morning Betsy. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Hey couple of questions. One was on the two that you did mention, there obviously is something that you\u2019re in the review of. I think the expectation is that in the U.S. at least we\u2019ll have to have senior through common 20% to 25% of risk weighted assets. And if you\u2019re on the high-end of that range, can you give us a sense of what you might do to minimize any impact? John Stumpf : There is still a lot to know. We\u2019re seeing similar headline numbers, maybe a little bit lower, 19.5 to 23.5. And this is all research that\u2019s been published based on information that\u2019s in the market that hasn\u2019t beneficially sanctioned. So who knows? And over what period of time it has to get phased in is unknown. What counts, what doesn\u2019t count among your existing capital structure is unknown. What -- which entities that you issue out of and whether there are going to be caps on those types of things. So there is a handful of questions that are unknown. Our sense is that we\u2019re going to end up at the lower end of the range. We calculate that we probably have about 18% today that qualifies and for the end up having the issue we\u2019ll probably be issuing a form of senior unsecured mostly Holdco debt. And it will happen over some period of time. And it will end up being an earnings drag because we\u2019ll issue that debt and pay our corporate spread and we\u2019ll take that cash and we\u2019ll reinvest it in some more yielding either HQLA or equivalent. And it will become a new part of the cost structure and capital structure of bank. So, my short answer is there is still a lot to know, but we\u2019ll deal with it when it comes and it doesn\u2019t seem instrumental. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Right. And there is no rush to get it done quickly, right, I mean I think it\u2019s -- you have until 01/01/19? John Stumpf : Don\u2019t know yet, but I\u2019ve heard it similarly that it will be a longish raise in period. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Then two other quick questions, one is on the auto business. You highlighted that you are nation\u2019s largest bank lender of auto and wanted to understand how you\u2019re thinking about that given the risk retention rules that are out there, clearly it\u2019s just a proposal so it\u2019s not fully baked yet but this outline that you have to at sometime in the future hold 5% of any securitizations that you do in auto. Does that matter to you? John Stumpf : It doesn\u2019t matter to us in our current business model because we don\u2019t securitize our auto loans; we own 100% of the risk on every one of them. And frankly in the auto loan securitization business for those who do use securitization that\u2019s the general business model which is that people own the bottom of the capital structure and retain their own risk which is different than mortgage, but that\u2019s how auto finance companies generally works. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to have a real impact on Wells Fargo. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Right. And obviously from the perspective of the competitive dynamic if there were a committed play? John Stumpf : Well, to the extent that it makes harder for other people to compete and that could be there for Wells Fargo. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And then lastly just on mortgage. John you mentioned at the beginning a lot of the headwinds that are sitting in front of us in mortgage, one of the questions we get often is what about the credit box? And is there an opportunity here as home prices improve and as consumer balance sheets improve that there is some losing of standards on the credit box; maybe you could speak to that? John Stumpf : Well I would say, I don\u2019t know that\u2019s valued so much. I think the bigger part of the credit box right now to open up would be a better understanding of repurchase risk. And we\u2019re doing a lot of work with folks and the government about that issue. I think that influenced it more than value of homes. Although values are important, but because your credit overlays today are not related to values, they\u2019re related to in many cases repurchase risks. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Right. And apparently the FHFA is working on crystallizing that more clearly for people I assume it\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about? John Stumpf : Yes, exactly. There has to be, I think it\u2019s helpful to America to American homeowners, perspective homeowners to the agencies and to originators that there is a understanding of when risk transfers. Now, if the originator does a poor job and doesn\u2019t underwrite properly, surly they should be held accountable. But if a default happens later and due to a technical issue unrelated to the payment ability of the customer that could have been known then risk should transfer. And whenever that period of time is, I think that would be helpful. And there are a number of Americans who want to buy home, can afford to buy home, who simply can get credit. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : So do you think you, if you had certain amount of clarity like two plus three years risk transfers assuming we did a good job as an underwriter, would that have a material impact on how you are putting on your credit overlays? John Stumpf : Well, it would surely change. It would really the change the way we look at overlays. And I\u2019m not saying it is, could have changes to market, but those every home that gets sold that satisfies a customers need not only fulfills a dream, but a dollar spent on a home multiply through the economy like no other thing that we do, I mean a loan to a small business, we love it, do a lot, but a loan to homeowner is magical in that respect. So every time we can serve another customer, good things happen. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Hi, can you hear me? John Stumpf : Yes, hi Mike. Good morning. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Hey, John, do you still dream about checking account? And the reason I asked -- or do you dream about them as much, because with the ten year where it is, I mean do you still go all gung ho, get as much deposits as you can get to the long-term value or do you somehow need to balance that with the need for shorter term profitability? John Stumpf : In fact Mike I\u2019m going to bed earlier these days, so I can even dream longer about them. I still just love checking, and here is why. But it\u2019s a good question, it\u2019s a serious question. First of all, when an account comes like we grew net primary checking accounts 4.9% on the consumer side and 5.6% on the business side, they don\u2019t come alone, they come with a relationship. And the increases you are seeing and debit card activity and credit card, we almost have 40% of our customers now carry our credit card that was 22% in 2009, and they do other things with us. And secondly, you know how expensive it is to bill liquidity for the LCR and other things; deposits are hugely important in that. So, now the love affair has not ended and we won\u2019t be in this environment forever. But if we can serve customers for a long time that feels like even we\u2019d love that. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Well you mentioned that you are trying to mitigate the impact somewhat with expenses and you are actually increasing your number of branches but I guess you are reducing the square feet. Can you give us some sense of what sort of square foot reduction you are looking for in your bank branches say over 5 or even 10 years? John Stumpf : I\u2019ll give you -- let me give you kind of a high level and then I\u2019ll try to answer your question specifically. When we -- if you go back five, six years, we had about 116 million or 117 million square feet and that was not only for our stores but for all of our people; today that\u2019s in the 93 million, 94 million square foot range. We still think we have quite ways to go. We have 6,200 banking stores and we have another couple of thousand other advisor and mortgage stores but let\u2019s just talk about the banking stores for a second. We try to refresh 500, 600 of those every year plus we are -- we\u2019re at pretty steady state right now. We\u2019re in that 6,200; we will replace two with the new one and relocate it. When we do refresh them, we will reduce in many case square footage or increase the density in the stores. I think you and I\u2019ve actually had discussions about which is now a three stores in the Washington area where these are, I wouldn\u2019t say stores of the future in terms of replace all of our 6,200 stores but they fit into the model where they are 1,000 to 1,200 square feet; during the day time it\u2019s a full functioning store, night time the walls folding, it\u2019s ATM best field 7X24; and so all of that matters in the mix. And the reason we are doing that is that we have found stores are still critically important to the overall distribution community and convenience we provide customers. So we will continue to march in this way; it doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to replace every store, sometimes we are even adding space because it\u2019s kind of a hub and spoke. So, it\u2019s really a collage of store designs and activities that all fit into this. But you\u2019re right with the idea of reducing overhead, reducing space we\u2019re providing the convenience customers want. Mike Mayo - CLSA: So over the last five years you reduced square feet by about one-fifth, over the next five years how much do you think you can reduce it by? John Shrewsberry : I don\u2019t know that we have absolute goal, but it will continue to go down. There are lots of opportunities and that\u2019s going to be critical. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And just one separate question, you had a comment in the American Bank I think it was and you alluded to it today that it\u2019s tougher for some individuals to get mortgage loans from Wells Fargo because of the risk of repurchase. And so is this simply, would you describe it as an unintended consequence of some of the regulatory actions over the past few years? John Shrewsberry : I would say it\u2019s unintended consequence of activity, I don\u2019t know but so much on the regulation side, but it sure is. It can give us a cause to pause and other originators, we\u2019re not unique in this. What you have repurchase request that go back 8 and 10 years and in many cases are things unrelated to the credit quality or the credit payment ability of the borrower at the time of the borrowing. We\u2019ve put open ways on. Now we start to reduce a little of those if we start to understand more about repurchase, but it\u2019s just, it is an unintended consequence. I don\u2019t if it\u2019s so much regulation as it is the activities of the GSEs. Mike Mayo - CLSA: So is this a permanent dampening for the mortgage market? John Shrewsberry : No, I actually think that we\u2019re going to -- I\u2019m hopeful we\u2019re going to figure this out. We\u2019re working with actually too many groups who are saying to us, this isn\u2019t working for us. And we\u2019re working with other originators, we\u2019re working with the Mortgage Bankers\u2019 Association, we\u2019re working with the head of the FHFA, we\u2019re working with the GSEs, we\u2019re working with government agencies the Fed and others because we need to figure this out. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Alright. Thanks a lot. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Thanks. Good morning. You guys mentioned in response to an earlier question that we\u2019re not going to be in this environment forever. Following up on that thought, I was hoping you could share your deposit growth outlook just from a high level with QE now coming to an end. Would you expect to see a slowdown and overall industry deposit growth and the corresponding excess liquidity building? And if so, does that mean that some of the excess liquidity driven NIM compression that we\u2019ve been seeing should abate? John Shrewsberry : Let me take a shot at that. Clearly money supply and what\u2019s happening there has influence. But I can tell you our household growth; I think John mentioned in his numbers, August is the strongest we\u2019ve seen in years. And because of where our store distribution and the geography of it, we happen to be in higher growth states. We happen to get a disproportionate growth of millennials and in emerging communities. So I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen at the top of the house with M1 or M2 I\u2019d would like that, but I\u2019m confident about the way we run our retail franchise and the work we\u2019re doing at wealth brokerage retirement. And frankly on the corporate side in winning new customers and growing not only existing accounts, but growing new accounts. And frankly that\u2019s one of the reason stores are important. Our strongest growth is in areas where we have the best distribution of a store network not that it\u2019s the only part of the distribution, but it\u2019s a critical part for acquisition. John Stumpf : One thing that I would add to that is that our deposits are disproportionately core deposits, operational deposits, relationship types of deposits and less so institutional deposits from people who are probably more inclined to immediately shipped out as Fed does whatever they\u2019re going to do to drain reserves in the system and to tighten monitory policy if that ever happen. And as a result, we feel like we\u2019ve got a stickier deposit base. And all things being equal, if we were, it was a question of loosing deposits versus retaining them, we obviously have the ability to price our deposits to compete with whatever the alternative investment opportunity or savings opportunity is for our customers because we\u2019re sitting here with a full service capability and lots of levers in the relationships that we have. So unlike some firms that probably have a higher percentage of institutional deposits that are seeking the last basis point of yield, I don\u2019t think, I think we compare favorably in terms of deposits stickiness. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. I had a second question on the rate environment, assuming that we do start to see the Fed funds rate increase next year. How are you thinking about the potential for an environment where the Feds taking retire at the short end of the curve, but demand for treasuries remain strong at the long end since then we end up with the flatter curve. How are you guys positioned to perform in that kind of environment? John Stumpf : That would actually be not that outcome at all because we would have less capital pressure on loan rates backing up on our bond portfolio and we\u2019d be benefiting as loans and other LIBOR linked assets re-price on at the short-end. So, at least with respect to those two drivers of accounting outcomes, those would be favorable. Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities : Excellent. Thank you. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Good morning, guys. John Stumpf : Hey, Scott. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill: I was just hoping you could spend just a moment or two talking about the operating losses, just given the trajectory, they were up kind of substantially in the second quarter and then up another bit again; I mean I can imagine given some of the conversations we\u2019ve had on regulatory issues, so what might be driving that. But can you spend a second maybe discussing when or how or even why those might crest and then hopefully begin to ebb back down? John Stumpf : Well, we\u2019ve mentioned that this month\u2019s elevated -- this quarter\u2019s elevated level reflects primarily litigation accruals and as a result, there is not much more specific color we can offer except to point you to our crystal clear disclosure in our Qs and K that describe everything that\u2019s probable and estimable and then sum. And it\u2019s like anything else; it\u2019s hard to know whether you\u2019re cresting or not until you\u2019re on the other side of it. So we feel this is a somewhat higher level than it\u2019s been recently and we think it\u2019s well disclosed. Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill: Okay. All right, sounds good. Thank you. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Thank you. I wanted to talk about two different lines of questioning more long-term in nature. One is that as you\u2019re pulling your short-term assets higher by about $25 billion each quarter and you mentioned that in the terms of liquidity but is also adding about 2% to your asset sensitivity every quarter. So it just seems like you\u2019re looking at the level of opportunities that you have in deciding to forego the yields of today and a hope for better yields tomorrow increasing asset sensitivity. So John, I just want to get your feel for how you\u2019re kind of managing that decision you mentioned several times. John Stumpf : Well, it\u2019s a complex decision; it involves our asset and liability and a lot of discussion among management from time to time. And the items that you just mentioned tend to be a little bit backward looking because you don\u2019t know what a quarter\u2019s loan growth is until it\u2019s happened. Floating rate loan growth contributes to asset sensitivity. The governing factors probably what our capital sensitivity is to a back up in rates if we deploy into duration instruments and out of cash equivalents. And getting that right is important, so that we don\u2019t find ourselves with higher rates that we\u2019ve all always been waiting for and a higher level of economic activity which would probably mean more non-interest income generation and more loan growth, a lot of exciting activity and at the same time be damaging our capital to the point that we couldn\u2019t take full advantage of it. And so that is one of those marginal drivers that probably caused us to be a little bit more in cash, a little bit more asset sensitive than -- versus being more fully invested today. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : But at least looking back, funding sources of long term debt and sticky deposits growth with growth in short term liquid assets naturally I guess I just want to make sure we\u2019re both agreeing that that makes you more asset sensitive each quarter. John Shrewsberry : That makes us more asset-sensitive. That\u2019s right. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : And then just real quickly, other line of thinking was John, how have you increased the growth in households and businesses? I mean moving that number up a 4 percentage point on the consumer side and 2, 4 percentage points on the business side long-term is a big driver. How do you see the source of those and is that sustainable at these higher levels? John Stumpf : Well, it\u2019s hard to know whether it\u2019s sustainable because again that\u2019s forward-looking. The reason that it\u2019s happening is a result of the quality of our people, the quality of our products, the execution of our business model and just consistent application of the value proposition that we\u2019re bringing. And it\u2019s paying dividends like we thought that it would, hope that it would. If work goes in the future as a function of variety of inputs that are hard to know, but we like our competitive standing and so to the extent that we\u2019re growing faster than our large and regional bank competition, we\u2019re not surprised by and that\u2019s what we expect. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : And would you see that in the traditional markets or more in you\u2019ve got the Wachovia markets and the franchise not pulled together. So you\u2019re really getting traction and being able to attract new customers now you got all that processed? John Shrewsberry : I think they are all traditional markets now. John Stumpf : Yes, exactly. We don\u2019t think\u2026 Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Understand, I don\u2019t know if incrementally you\u2019re getting some new households in those newer let\u2019s say market? John Stumpf : We\u2019re getting it in all of our markets. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : Alright, thanks. John Shrewsberry : They\u2019re all good to us. Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks : I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Good morning, guys. How are you? John Stumpf :  Hi Nancy. John Shrewsberry : Good morning. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: This is sort of an overarching question John and John that goes to a lot of the stuff we\u2019re hearing not only on your call, but on the JP Morgan Chase call about these sort of continuing calls for increased capital all these other new requirements that are being put on the industry to which there is seemingly no end. And there is -- I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read this in the press as well, this beginning characterization of the banking industry as the new electric utility. Are the regulators trying to enforce so much conformity on the industry that they are going to do away with the dynamism and the willingness of the banking industry? John could you just give us, either John, just give us some perspective on that and where you think that indeed is happening? John Stumpf : Well, there is no question that they can stay. The regulatory, the global regulatory community keeps apparently keeps adding on to both capital and liquidity requirements that are going to have the combined effect of changing business models, increasing operating costs or financing costs and then applying that to an increased denominator of equity in the ROE calculation. To an industry that broadly speaking other than Wells Fargo and perhaps some regional banks has not been over achieving in returns over the last couple of years. So, if you roll the tape forward, I assume that that gets mathematically worse before it gets betters unless a higher rate environment, a higher growth environment a real optimization on the part of the most impact banks in terms of changing their business model allows them to perform at a higher level. So, I think it is, it\u2019s a consequence of what you\u2019re describing, it is happening and we can\u2019t talk or anybody else is going to deal with it. But we\u2019ve, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re proud to have to continue to generate a top of the peer group type of returns in spite of the amount of capital that we\u2019re carrying and the ample liquidity that we\u2019re carrying too. John Shrewsberry : Nancy it\u2019s an interesting question and there is no question that there has been increases, some of them are settled and different issues be combining constraints and different ways. Of our business, 97% of our revenues come from the U.S. We love our international business, but we\u2019re dominant -- our dominant part of our business is here that makes it a bit easier for us and the challenge and I think the opportunity for leadership is to make sure that we do both we meet or exceed the requirements on the capital liquidity and those side and also we continue to invest in things that attract team members to us, attract customers to us, be dynamic in the marketplace differentiating. And we\u2019re so embedded in the real economy that the things we\u2019re doing continue to allow us to grow that business. So, we can never predict the future, but that\u2019s a challenge for us as leaders to do both. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: John, do you see yourself, John Stumpf, do you see yourself as having to change your plans for growth either businesses that you would like to be in? Do you see that you might have to divest any of your present businesses? Should this sort of regulatory minds that continue and intensify? John Stumpf : At this point in time the answer is no, because again virtually everything we do here starts with a customer. And we look at relationship value and pricing and different businesses have different returns and so forth. And we\u2019re always thinking about adjusting like few -- last quarter we sold smaller insurance offices, doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t like interest business, we just -- but there is always things that are going on. But there is nothing in anything I see today that would say I can\u2019t be in this business or we can\u2019t be in that business; it relates to customers. Nancy Bush - NAB Research, LLC: Okay, all right. Thank you. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Please go ahead. Kevin Barker - Compass Point : Good morning. John Stumpf : Good morning. Kevin Barker - Compass Point : I noticed that you had quite a bit of increasing construction loans quarter-over-quarter and they\u2019re basically staying flat for several years. Is there something in particular that\u2019s causing the development and expansion of construction loans or is that something that you\u2019re looking at like an initiative going forward? John Stumpf : We\u2019re the largest commercial real estate lender in the country. And as I\u2019ve said in some place recently, you fly around; go in any city looks like a crane convention going on. I mean there is a lot of commercial activity going on and we serve that community and that sector of the economy. There is also housing is better than it has been in the past. So I think it reflects more the natural activity happening in the marketplace as opposed to us changing our strategy somehow. Kevin Barker - Compass Point : Alright. And then in regards to student loan business, are you still planning on selling the thought portfolio by year end or can you talk about the overall investor appetite for these loans? And then separately on the private side, I know this is a peak lending quarter for student loans but could you provide any color around the demand trend from students given the overall level of student out there? John Stumpf : Well, with respect to the first part of your question, we still do intend to sell those loans, can\u2019t really comment on the specific to sales moving forward, progressing as expected. And what I can tell you is like any other fixed income asset category in this highly liquid environment there is plenty of interest. But in terms of whether it happens in the fourth quarter or later, I don\u2019t want to be too specific. We remain very committed to private student lending and of course our student lending team now will be even more focused on our private business once we\u2019ve sold the self loans. And with respect to whether demand after accounting for seasonality as you mentioned has changed or not changed. We are in a point in time when a very high number of people are already student borrowers and but it\u2019s still one of the three or four most important things that are customers do, they buy a home, they buy a car, they finance their education and they save for retirement and we expect that to continue. Kevin Barker - Compass Point : Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. John Stumpf : Okay. I think we\u2019re done with the call now. I want to first of all thank all of you for jointing us and thank our 265,000 team members across our company for an outstanding quarter. If you look at the drivers of long-term growth, loans, deposits, the capital, the liquidity we have, the household growth, it sure makes us optimistic about the future. We operate within our ROA, ROE and efficiency ratio targets that we had provided a couple of years ago. And we\u2019re really proud that we return more capital to you our owners. So we\u2019re well positioned for the future and we\u2019ll see you in 90 days. Thank you very much everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference. Jim Rowe : Thank you, Regina and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf. John Stumpf : Thank you, Jim. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We just completed another outstanding year at Wells Fargo. We generated record earnings, produced strong deposit and loan growth, grew the number of customers we serve, improved credit quality, enhanced our strong risk management practices, strengthened our capital and liquidity levels and rewarded our shareholders by increasing our dividend and buying back more shares. Our achievements during 2014 demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model and our continued focus on the real economy. Let me share just some of our accomplishments during the past year. We generated earnings of $23 billion and earnings per share of $4.10, both up 5% from the prior year. We grew both revenue and pretax, pre-provision profit. We had strong broad-based loan growth. Our core loan portfolio increased by $60 billion or 8%. Our deposit franchise continue to generate strong consumer and balanced growth with total deposit up $89 billion or 8% and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.2%. Our credit performance continue to be very strong with net charge-off down $1.6 billion and our net charge-off ratio declining to just 35 basis points for the year. Our capital levels increased even as we returned more capital to shareholders. We returned $12.5 billion to our stockholders through dividends and net share repurchases, up 74% from a year ago. While we serve our customers throughout the world, 97% of our revenue comes from the United States and there had been many signs of strength in the U.S. economy. GDP growth accelerated during 2014 and may be even stronger in 2015. Last year was the strongest year of job growth in 15 years and December was the 50th consecutive month of job creation, unprecedented in U.S. history. Consumer confidence is at its highest level since the peak of the last economic expansion. Home ownership remains an aspiration for most Americans and recent development such as the announced reduction in FHA premiums, GSE clarification on repurchase rules and changes in GSE lending guidelines should provide some benefit to the housing market where affordability remains attractive. While lower oil prices have created volatility in the financial markets, America as a whole is a net consumer of energy and American households will benefit from the decline in energy prices, which is positive for the U.S. economy. I believe the improvement in the economy, the strength of our balance sheet, the diversity of our businesses and the continued commitment of our team members to meet our customer's financial needs will provide Wells Fargo with many opportunities in the year ahead. John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our fourth quarter results. John? John Shrewsberry : Thanks John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplements starting on Page two. John and I will then answer your questions. Wells Fargo had another strong quarter, earning $5.7 billion and $1.02 in EPS in the fourth quarter. Our results included continued strong loan and deposit growth that was diversified across our businesses and credit quality continued to reflect the benefit of our ongoing risk discipline. Our capital levels remained strong even as we returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Slide three highlights our strong full year results that John discussed at the beginning of the call, including increased revenue and pretax, pre-provision profit, strong loan and deposit growth, higher earnings and increasing our net payout ratio to 57%. Page four highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income in the fourth quarter. The benefit of our diversified business model is that we have over 90 businesses that performed differently based on interest rates in the economic environment. While the balance between spread and fee income has remained consistent over time, the drivers of fee income have varied. For example over the past five years, mortgage banking as a share of total fee income has been its highest 28%, but because of the decline in mortgage refinancing activity, mortgage banking fees have declined as expected and represented 15% of fee income in the fourth quarter. However other businesses have benefitted from current market conditions, our trust in investment fees have steadily increased over the past five years and we're 36% of fee income in the fourth quarter. These examples demonstrate the benefit of our diversification and how our business mix enables us to focus on meeting our customer's financial needs, while retaining our risk discipline. Let me highlight some key drivers of our fourth quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective starting on Page five. I'll discuss the drivers of our strong loan and deposit growth later in the call. Short-term investments in fed funds sold declined $3.5 billion from the third quarter due to the deployment of liquidity into loans and investment securities. This was the first time since the fourth quarter of 2011 that we've had a linked quarter decline. Investment securities increased $24 billion from the third quarter, due to $35 billion of purchases partially offset by run-off and maturities. The majority of our purchases were U.S. treasury and federal agency securities. Turning to the income statement on Page six, revenue grew $230 million during the quarter with growth in net interest income and stable non-interest income. Expenses increased in the quarter reflecting higher personnel cost, continued investments in our businesses and risk related initiatives and some typically higher fourth quarter expenses. Our results in the quarter also reflected lower income tax expense, which was down $123 million. As shown on Page seven, we continue to have strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter, our 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The core loan portfolio grew by $60.4 billion, or 8% from a year ago, and was up $26 billion or 13% annualized from the third quarter. Loan growth in the fourth quarter included $6.5 billion from financing related to the sale of our government guaranteed student loans as well as the Dillard\u2019s credit card portfolio acquisition. Our liquidating portfolio decreased $20.1 billion from a year ago. It is now only 7% of our total loans, down from 22% at the end of 2008. Total average loan yields remain fairly stable declining just two basis points from the third quarter. On Page eight we highlight our loan portfolio to have strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up $36.4 billion or 15% from a year ago with broad based growth that I\u2019ll highlight on the next page. Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $14.4 billion or 7% from a year ago reflecting continued growth in high quality conforming mortgages, pardon me, non-conforming mortgages primarily jumbo loans. The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio was outstanding with only six basis points of annualized credit loss in the fourth quarter. Auto loans were up $4.9 billion or 10% from last year. While we continued to benefit from the strong auto market, new originations were down from a year ago, reflecting our continued risk and pricing discipline in a competitive market. Credit card balances were up $4.2 million or 16% from a year ago, benefiting from a combination of organic account and loan growth as well as the benefit of the Dillard's portfolio acquisition. Slide Nine demonstrates the diversity of businesses that contributed to the growth in C&I loans. Let me highlight just a few. Asset-backed finance increased $16.7 billion, which included $6.5 billion from financing related to a government guaranteed student loan sale. Corporate banking grew $5.8 billion, driven by new customer growth and higher utilization rates from existing customers. And capital finance grew $3.8 billion reflecting new customer growth. As you can see on Page 10, we had over $1.1 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $22.7 billion or 8% annualized from the third quarter. Our average deposit cost declined one basis point to nine basis points in the fourth quarter. Our strong growth in checking customers continued in the fourth quarter with primary consumer checking customers growing 5.2% from a year ago and primary small business and business banking checking customers increasing 5.4%. Our success reflected the advantages Wells Fargo offers including broad based and industry-leading distribution channels, enhanced product offerings that make it easier for customers to do more business with us and improved customer retention. We continue to grow net interest income on a tax equivalent basis, up $255 million from the third quarter, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets up $43.5 billion or 3%. The net interest margin, declined two basis point from the third quarter due to strong deposit growth, which resulted in higher average balances of cash and short term investments and from actions we took in the third quarter, which resulted in higher average balances and liquidity-related funding. The impact of all other balance sheet growth and reprising benefit in the margin by three basis point due to a larger investment portfolio and stronger loan originations, increased interest income from variable sources benefited the margin by one basis point. Our balance sheet remains asset sensitive, so we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from higher rates, but as we\u2019ve demonstrated by growing net interest income throughout the year, we're not relying on rates to increase to generate growth. Of course the first quarter will be impacted by two fewer days in the quarter.  Total non-interest income was stable from third quarter as higher trust and investment fees, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage commissions and a $217 million gain on the sale of government guaranteed student loans was offset by a $396 million decline in market sensitive revenue, driven by lower equity gains and lower mortgage banking revenue and deposit service charges. The decline in deposit service charges in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower overdraft related fess resulting from changes we implemented in early October designed to provide customers with more real-time information to manage their deposit accounts and avoid overdrafts. Mortgage banking revenue declined $118 million from the third quarter. As expected, mortgage origination income was down from the last quarter reflecting reduced volume from the seasonally lower purchase market. The decline in mortgage rates during the quarter resulted in refinancing volume increasing to 40% of originations up from 30% last quarter. While it's still early, the continued declining rates could benefit origination volumes from the first quarter and we currently expect volumes to be relatively consistent with fourth quarter levels, despite the fact that the first quarter usually reflects its lower purchase market. Our gain on sale margin was consistent with last quarter and is expected to remain within the range we\u2019ve seen over the past four quarters. Servicing income increased modestly from third quarter reflecting lower unreimbursed direct servicing cost, partially offset by lower net head results. Our total trust and investment fees were up $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter which was a record high and increased to $151 million from third quarter driven by higher investment banking activity. Our expenses continue to reflect our investments in our businesses including risk related initiatives.  As shown on Page 13, expenses were up $399 million from third quarter. There were a number of factors driving this increase. Personal expenses increase $272 million reflecting higher deferred comp expense, which is offsetting revenue, higher revenue based incentive compensation and higher healthcare costs. A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. Equipment expense was up $124 million, primarily due to annual software license renewals. Outside professional services increased $116 million, which included higher project related spending on business investments as well as risk related initiatives. Advertising expenses were also elevated up $42 million from third quarter. While these typically higher expenses should be lower next quarter we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense. Our expenses will also reflect our continued investments in our infrastructure -- our risk infrastructure, including hiring new team members and ongoing project spending. Our efficiency ratio is 58.1% for full year 2014 and we expect the efficiency ratio for full year 2015 to remain within our target range of 55% to 59%even if the upper end of our target range we're operating more efficiently than many of our peers. Turning to our business segments starting on Page 14, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 7% from a year ago and down 1% from the third quarter. I've already highlighted the strong growth in primary checking customers. We've also been successfully adding retail bank households. Through November our year-to-date household growth rate was the highest since 2010. Meeting the financial needs of these new households will help drive growth across our diversified product line. Our debit and credit card businesses are examples of where we've had success and yet still have opportunities for continued growth. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago driven by primary checking customer growth and increased usage from our existing customers. Our credit card penetration rate increased to 42%, up from 37% a year ago. Credit card purchase volume grew 17% from a year ago reflecting account growth and increased usage among our existing customers. Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the fourth quarter, down 7% from a year ago and up 3% from the third quarter. Loan growth continued to be strong with average loans up $32.2 billion or 11% from a year ago with growth across many businesses as I highlighted earlier. Credit quality remained outstanding with eight consecutive quarters of net recoveries. Deposit growth was also strong with average core deposits up $33.9 billion or 13% from a year ago. Results also benefited from strong investments banking fees, up 10% from a year ago, driven by higher loan syndication fees, high yield debt origination fees and equity underwriting. Treasury management revenue increased 11% from a year ago, benefiting from record product sales in 2014 and re-pricing. Wealth, brokerage and retirement earned $514 million in the fourth quarter, up 5% from a year ago and down at 7% from the third quarter. Revenue grew 6% from a year ago with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. The growth in fee income was driven by a 12% increase in asset-based fees as we continue to execute on our strategic initiative of focusing on plan-based relationships resulting in higher recurring revenue. Our brokerage advisory assets grew to $423 billion, up $48 million dollars or 13% from a year ago, primarily due to positive net flows. Loan growth for WBR remained strong, up 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in high quality, non-confirming mortgage loans. Turning to Page 17, credit quality in the fourth quarter remained strong with a net charge-off ratio of 34 basis points of average loans. The $67 million increase in net charge-offs from the third quarter was primarily driven by lower recoveries down $54 million, which we would expect at this stage with the credit cycle. Nonperforming assets have declined for nine consecutive quarters and were down $739 million from the third quarter. Nonaccrual loans declined $517 million and foreclosed assets declined to $222 million. The reserve release was $250 million in the fourth quarter, down $50 million from third quarter and down $350 million from a year ago. Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III using the advanced approach full phased on at 10.44% in the fourth quarter. Our ratio declined slightly from the third quarter, reflecting an increase in the risk weighted assets, primarily from strong loan growth in the quarter. We stated that our long term target is 10%, which includes a buffer over required minimums. Since we've achieved our targeted level, our capital ratios may fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting changes in asset levels or composition or changes in OCI impacted by market volatility. These potential changes are why we maintain a buffer. As shown on Slide 19, we returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Our common shares outstanding declined by 45 million shares in the fourth quarter, reflecting 62 million shares purchased during the quarter. In addition we entered into a $750 million forward repurchase contracts that's expected to settle in the first quarter for approximately 14 million shares. As a reminder, our share issuance is usually higher in the first half of the year, given the timing of certain employee benefit plan issuances. So in summary, our results in 2014 and for the fourth quarter reflected the benefit of our diversified business model, with strong growth in loans and deposits. Our loan portfolio is well diversified and charge-offs were near historic lows. We increased the amount of our capital and liquidity and returned $12.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Our net payout ratio was 57% for the year within our targeted range of 55% to 75%. We believe we're well positioned to benefit from an improving economy and increased customer base. Our diverse product line and our continued risk discipline. Our diversified business model has performed well across a variety of economic and interest rate environments and I am optimistic that it will continue to produce opportunities for our customers, our team members and our shareholders in the year ahead. We'll now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Morford : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. John Stumpf : Hey morning. Joe Morford : I just wondered if you could speak to how we should think about weighing the positive and negative effects of the sharp drop in energy prices on the bank, while it should help out the consumer businesses, is it enough to offset any potential credit issues or probably slow down in loan growth and investment banking activity? John Stumpf : Well as I mentioned in my comments Joe, since the United States is a net consumer, net importer of oil, we think it's a positive for the U.S. economy. Clearly that's on average because there is going to be some states that are impacted. Some customers who are going to be impacted and some businesses that's going to be impacted, but we serve 70 million customers. Virtually all of them know how to fill the gas tank and go to a gas pump and that's a real benefit. So we think net, net it's an opportunity. Surely there are offsets like we said, but even within the oil and gas business and John mentioned we are participant there. It's about 2% of our loans. There is still a lot of opportunity for consolidation there and we'll participate in that with our customers. We're looking at our portfolio. We analyze that. We've been through that over the past, but net, net, we think it's a positive. Joe Morford : Okay. Great, I guess somewhat related to that with the teams recently, the expectation is now that higher rates are getting pushed out. We could be lower for longer, which theoretically could weigh on margins. Do you expect to be able to offset that with better growth in the business amidst the stronger economies you talk about or do you see any need to take a harder look at expenses and what other levers might you have to pull there? John Shrewsberry : We're always taking a hard look at expenses. So there is nothing incremental that we would plan on doing there, but continuing to be as vigilant as we have. We've been operating at a pretty strong level in a zero interest rate environment for a very long time and while because of the way our balance sheet is positioned, it would probably be -- there is upside when short term rates move and if that happen later, then that upside might be realized later. We're continuing to position ourselves to compete and to perform in this interest rate environment and so loan growth, deposit growth, redeploying excess liquidity into earning assets, as I said being vigilant on expense, all of those things contribute to the performance that we've had and that we're anticipating continuing to have until that time that rates begin to move. Joe Morford : Okay. Thanks so much for the thoughts. John Stumpf : Thanks Joe. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. John Stumpf : Hi John. John McDonald : I was wondering John on just a question on credit and provision asset quality clearly remains excellent and I wasn\u2019t sure if you mentioned future reserve releases John, but with such strong loan growth and credit metrics now looking stable, should we expect the reserve releases to taper off and might you need to start adding to reserves at some point if loan growth continues at this kind of pace? John Shrewsberry : I think the short answer is yes. if we have robust loan growth going forward all things being equal even, that would contribute to the need for some amount of incremental provisioning. So it's going to be a function of the amount of loan growth, the mix of loan growth, the quality of the portfolio overall and general economic conditions. One thing I would add to Joe's first question also is there is no specific provisioning action in the fourth quarter for what's going on in the energy world. There is nothing anticipated, nothing necessary at the moment, but there is nothing in that quarter either. John McDonald : Okay. Did you make a comment about reserve releases John and if you achieved kind of -- in the past couple of quarters, you said reserve releases could continue. I was wondering if that changed a little bit now with credit bottoming in if I missed out. John Shrewsberry : With the size of the portfolio, the size of the allowance and the amount of the fourth quarter's release, the $250 million, it's close to call. We've said in the recent past to expect them to taper. Now for the reasons that you mentioned and I described, there could be future releases -- there could be future net provisioning. So we're at that point in the cycle I think. John McDonald : Okay. Got it and then in terms of just the net interest income, the puts and takes, did you say how big the Dillard\u2019s portfolio was or could you tell us? John Shrewsberry : We can't because of the nature of the contract we have with our customers. You can see the amount of loan growth in the credit card portfolio from quarter to quarter and that's a combination of the organic growth in the Dillard\u2019s portfolio. John McDonald : Okay. And then any clarity you can offer on what opened up in terms of opportunity to deploy the liquidity this quarter, anything driving that in particular? John Shrewsberry : Well, some clarity around our liquidity framework, clarity around -- further clarity around LCR, further clarity on what kind of cash versus other HQLA we would need to have. I think that emboldened us a little bit in terms of finding an entry point, but as we've said, these are difficult times for finding attractive entry points into fixed income markets when we're thinking about making that switch. John Stumpf : And John also we had as you know continued very strong deposit growth. John McDonald : Got it. Okay. Great. And just one last quick thing on TLAC John, rules on finalized, we do have a proposal, how do you feel on that and would you have to do some gradual preparing for that as we go forward? John Shrewsberry : Sure, well just depending on where the ultimate rule comes out versus the range that's been published, at the low end of the range we've got less to do and at the high end of the range we would have more to do. There is still a lot to know and there is some wood to chop in the regulatory realm to get to the final rule where on the record is pointing out that we really don't -- the industry doesn\u2019t understand the need for the magnitude of the total buffer that's been to our loss absorbing capacity that's been talked about here. We certainly find that it lands a little bit harder on people who seem to have less risky business models. Those of us who are deposit funded with a little bit more straightforward deposit taking and lending type of activity. We would like some clarity on why that makes sense, but however it lands, within the range that's been published, the approach for Wells Fargo is going to be to add more termed at the holding company level and that will have a -- that will have a P&L consequence that we have to navigate through and it will be substantially more manageable at the lower end of the range and somewhat more expensive at the higher end of the range. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Yes. Good morning. Thank you. John Stumpf : Good morning. Erika Najarian : I appreciate the color that you have given us so far on what you expect from mortgage originations in the first quarter, but as we think about the full year and think about your comments earlier, high consumer confidence, accelerating GDP in the context of potentially lower long rate for longer. Is it possible that from an industry level, the origination growth for this year could surpass the current MBA forecast of 6%. John Shrewsberry : Yes. The numbers last time that I've seen from them is $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion. Yes, it could be higher based on those things. As I mentioned in my comments with what was done recently in FHA and some of the things that the GSEs are doing and if rates stay low or are favorable, surely we could see more activity and you could see actually more activity on both the refinance side and the purchased-money side. We'll just have to see how that goes, but -- and I don't think there has been any reduction or any update on those numbers from the MBA, but it could the higher end of that range. Erika Najarian : Got it. And on the flip side to that, you mentioned that you did get more clarity on also your HQLA with regards to being more aggressive on liquidity deployment, but John, you've mentioned several times that absolute level of rates have dictated your cash deployment or liquidity deployment strategy. As we look at into 2015, was the clarity around the rules enough to make you a little bit more aggressive about deploying your liquidity into earning assets or is it going to continue to be largely rate dependent? John Shrewsberry : Oh, it's a good question. It's substantially rate dependent at this point and loan growth dependent as well because that's the first call in all of our available liquidity is making loans to customers. But if we believe that we're in a lower for longer, long term rate scenario separate that from policy rates for a moment, but just thinking about the tenure and mortgage rates etcetera, at the margin that probably emboldens us a little bit additionally to convert what's cash today into duration over the course of the year. And actually we still have tens of billions available. So there's just a lot of liquidity on the sheet. Erika Najarian : Understood and just a quick follow-up, we appreciate the color that you gave in terms of the impact of energy, as there have been a lot of questions from investors in terms of what it would take for banks to adjust its qualitative reserve to reflect lower energy prices? I was just wondering if that's how Wells Fargo does it or do you really look at the reserve at least in terms of your energy and commercial exposure on a name by name, loan by loan basis? John Shrewsberry : So in the case of commercial and corporate loans, it's absolutely that some of the parts have a name by name basis and the risk rating on each loan. We have hundreds of customers in the energy business. They are in the E&P or upstream part of the market. There are midstream companies. There are services companies. We have the largest team in this area, very long tenure. Have been through several cycles and we're working with -- we're building customer by customer and working through each situation to figure out what this job means to them based on their leverage, based on their hedging profile, based on their assets, based on their management capability and that will lead to risk rating changes on a loan by loan basis or a name by name basis as time unfold and it's that activity that would lead to changes in our reserving posture for the portfolio. John Stumpf : And we don't want to minimize this, but this is nature of that business. If you go back just six years, we've had $30 a barrel oil and we've had $140 a barrel oil. We've seen gas for example, natural gas go from $6, $7 Mcf to $2 and some change today and that's just part of that business. John Shrewsberry : On the E&P side of that portfolio, those tend to be reserve based loans, asset based loans with a very interactive approach between the bank and the borrower in terms of determining the value of the collateral and then re-margining the loan down to reflect changes in the value of the collateral and of course that's at our discretion. We have our own engineers and we're very engaged in that process. So all of that -- all of that ties into what the future reserving needs requirements are for that portfolio and as I said, nothing obviously has revealed itself yet and there is nothing in the fourth quarter specifically for that. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. John Shrewsberry : Sure. Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning, guys. John Stumpf : Hi Ken. Ken Usdin : A couple of questions on the fee side, John you had mentioned some of the tweaks you made in October on the service charges side, so I am wondering if you can help us understand what types of changes those were? And then how you're looking at your product set with regards to either payday advance and whatever pending rules we could still get at some point next year on overdrafts and if that would continue to have an impact on your deposit fees? John Shrewsberry : So what happened in October wasn\u2019t a change in the product or what we charged for and rather we un-ruled some incremental technology that allows our customers to have more real time information to manage their own baking affairs and they've been using that information and successfully reducing the amount of over-drafting method and which had an impact on our revenue. We think it's very customer friendly and it's good for all of us. That's distinct from any pricing approach or a product approach that we'll have. With respect to -- go ahead. Ken Usdin : Okay. No go ahead. John Shrewsberry : You asked about short term or payday type lending, I think it's clear that during 2014 we discontinued a product that we used to offer that was a direct deposit advance product that allowed people to borrow on a short term unsecured basis with their next direct deposit pay check as security for a source of repayment for the loan and there was some regulatory urging around that. I think most of the discussion around those types of products is now frankly outside the banking system because it's private financed companies who are providing that and that's how it seems to be doing that with from a regulatory perspective. I would also tell you that the discontinued product is out of the run rate at this point. So the impact has been fully realized. Ken Usdin : And then overdrafts? John Shrewsberry : Hard to say much more about it other its -- we're not in the process of re-pricing or rethinking the product capability. The results that you'll see in our numbers are a reflection of the activity and behavior of our customers as they manage their own baking affairs. Ken Usdin : Okay. Another question I had was just on the kind of market related revenues. They've been trending a little bit lower if I combine trading activities, securities gains, equity investment gains and that's even with the student loan gain in that 354 number. Should we generically expect that you'll still be able to generate this type of market related revenue or is it more likely that we can trend down over time? John Shrewsberry : So there is lot of moving parts there and I would look at a multi quarter average to think about how to model it. On the trading side, their customer accommodation, customer facing trading revenue that we make, which is a pretty modest part of Wells Fargo revenue profile, but will probably ebb and flow along the lines of what you're seeing in the industry just at a more modest level. That also -- the trading line also includes the impact of our deferred comp hedging programs. So it's a little noisy given the magnitude of that versus the magnitude of our trading businesses, but those will be with based on industry factors and the deferred comp programs will be more revenue and more expense in an up market and less revenue and less expense in a down market generally speaking. On the other elements, we've got gains from equity securities, gains from debt securities and in the equity space, you've seen some of the businesses that we've been involved in that frankly are -- that continue to be -- are sources of revenue that we would anticipate seeing if market conditions stay the same as they are today. So I wouldn\u2019t model that down too heavily. And on the debt side, given the levels of rates that we're at and in some markets the levels of spreads that we're at, there are some debt securities, which it makes sense for us to sell and monetize from time to time just because their market value substantially exceeds what we can imagine as their intrinsic or certainly their carrying value. So there will be pops in there from time to time as well. And it's some of those things that gets to that collection that you described. Ken Usdin : Okay. And last one, maybe you can just talk a little about the momentum in the trust business and what type of outlook you see just through asset gathering and after a really strong year and in that part of the business. Do you see -- how is the pipeline for asset growth looking? John Shrewsberry : We're very happy and pleased with the progress we've made in that area. One of the biggest opportunities we have is relationship between David Carroll's Wealth, Brokerage and Retirement Group and Carrie Tolstedt's Community Banking Group. We have as many assets away from customers who call us their bank as we do under management right now. So the relationship and the working date of their to bring those assets home if you will, has been a big opportunity for us and -- but I still view this. Of all the opportunities we have in the company, with all of our businesses probably that is our biggest opportunity to jump a curve or to even do -- to show some incremental growth above what you would see in other more mature businesses. So a lot of opportunity there; pleased with where we are, lot more to do. Ken Usdin : Thanks guys. Appreciate it. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead. Paul Miller : Yes, thank you very much and there has been a lot of news thrown out today, but on your -- if you mentioned this in the prepared marks I apologize, but your C&I loans jumped up. Is that where the Ginnie Mae financing came through on your balance sheet? John Shrewsberry : No, that's not that Paul. Paul Miller : So that's just pure\u2026 John Shrewsberry : The biggest thing to call out is the student loan financing that we did. If you saw the portfolio of student loans and we provided some financing to the company who bought those loans and so if one items stands out in the quarter as outsized, it would be that, but those are all commercial loans. Paul Miller : Yes and is there any particular industry that are doing well? Is it just across the Board and across geographic that this line item picked up? Because this is one of the line items we've been waiting to see pick up in general amongst the bigger ranks. John Shrewsberry : Very broad based. John Stumpf : Very broad. Paul Miller : And you're not saying because the questions that I get is that everybody is concerned about the energy credits, but you're just not seeing and I know you made some opening comments about that, but you're just not seeing anything on the negative side on energy credits at this point. John Shrewsberry : Well this drop in crude is very recent and the companies are taking the appropriate evasive actions to preserve cash, to de-lever, to reduce their expense base etcetera, but it hasn\u2019t worked its way into loan quality. Now loan demand certainly will be down in that area I assume, but in the fourth quarter you can see what the change in growth is out there and net outstandings was which more than makes up for whatever reduced demand there is in the energy space. Paul Miller : Okay guys. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your credit card growth strategy. I think most would agree that credit card assets yields have held up quite well in this slow rate environment relative to other asset classes. Would you consider competing more aggressively on rates in an effort to growth your share of outstanding balances particularly since the high return business where you arguably have room to give up a bit on pricing, while still generating returns that are attractive relative to other lower return over yielding asset classes? John Stumpf : Well let me say it this way. First of all we love the card business, especially for our community bank customers and we've grown from the low to mid 20s penetration to now to 42% of our customers carry our credit card. And we like that business a whole lot not only from the balances we get, but to be relevant to our customers as far as handling their payments, providing them services that are even around payments and so forth for them. We want to provide great value. Pricing sure is part of that. You've seen recently where we've partnered with American Express. We do a ton of business with Visa on the higher end, higher value cards. So this is really a strategy about getting more cards top of wallet with our customers and pricing, rewards, the whole value of proposition is part of that. I wouldn\u2019t say it's just any one thing around price per se, but it around value. Bill Carcache : Great. Thank you. A separate question if I may on municipal deposits, can you talk about how significant municipal deposits are to Wells? Are you deemphasizing them given their relative unfriendly LCR treatment and to what extent do you see future revenue opportunity for holding them? John Stumpf : We have a -- we have a very big municipal business and deposits are certainly part of that. It's a service that we provide to the tax exempt issuing community and by municipal, it's all forms of state and local and country government and other non-profit types of customers. The unfriendly LCR treatment came from the fact that municipal deposits tend to be collateralized by us so that their municipal depositor is safer in the event of a problem with their bank and that wasn\u2019t being taken into account in the original approach to LCR. We think we've gotten that favorable outcome there, so that they're now LCR friendly. Still very competitive. We still like those deposits. We still very much enjoy those relationships because there is a lot of banking service that we provide to those types of clients, but they don't have the LCR problem that they might have seemed to have in pre-clarification that came out in the third or fourth quarter. Bill Carcache : Okay. So it was my understanding that for the purposes of the LCR calculation in the numerator, the high quality liquid assets would not be able to include the collateral associated with the deposits and then had to outflow in the denominator on day one. Is that not the case anymore? John Stumpf : I don't think that you have it right. I think that it works fine. Incidentally there were two issues that people were trying to address in tweaks to LCR relating to munis. The other one was whether high quality muni bonds would be considered HQLA on the asset side and I don't think that there has been a resolution there and there are a number of our customer -- our clients who issue high quality muni bonds to take exception of that and we will see where that goes. But on the deposit side, I think we've cracked the code. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Good morning. I had a question about the efficiency ratio. First what were the drivers in higher revenue driven compensation and deferred comp, especially with lower originations and software trading results? And then the following question to that is are you still at the upper end of your efficiency target, what can you do to get at least back towards the middle end? John Shrewsberry : Well so the drivers of the revenue oriented portion of increased compensation included a handful of businesses. I would say investment banking was one of them where we were $150 million up in the quarter and so some portion of the elevated expense is attributable to that, but it comes from a few others as well. And again to those businesses that performed better in the fourth quarter, so it could be with 90 different businesses, it can be a little here, a little there. That was part of it. So we find ourselves in the high 58% or now 59% and with a lot of emphasis on trying to be as efficient as we can and how we spend our money every day. There are no guarantees that we're moving toward the middle of the lower end of the range in this interest rate environment and as we go through a full year. While we're tackling the things that we need to tackle, we spend a lot of money on risk management, compliance related initiatives other things that have a regulatory origin and some of that is semi permanent, might be around for several quarters and some of it is going to around the run rate for a while. If rates begin to move up that probably moves us down in the range, but it's frankly a 59%, which is the high end of our range where we can tolerate that. We've been performing very well. John Stumpf : Mike, you're hitting one of the important issues for us as. As John mentioned, we take this seriously. We're looking for all those opportunities to eliminate expenses where customers don't find value and it's an ongoing continuous process for us, reducing square footage. It's one of those looking hard at the kind of money we spend that is not revenue producing if you will, but also making sure that we take a look at the long term. So we continue to invest in things like late last year Apple Pay and other things that we do to provide convenience for our customers. So it's always a don't waste, but also we take a long term view, but this continues to be a big focus for us. Mike Mayo : Well correct me if I am wrong. You have a 55% to 59% efficiency target range and what I am hearing now is, well if the rate environment we might be at 59% whereas I wasn\u2019t sure if I heard that same message before or saying well unless rates go up, we won't get to the middle part of the range and you were a little bit lower before. So am I hearing the message wrong or is it simply that you've done what you could for so long with the low rate environment and you can't do a whole lot more or what is it that leads you to say, well, 59% okay. John Shrewsberry : Well I think when we had the range, we knew that we would surely we would love to be at 55%, but we also recognized that that's how we gave a range. These were -- think of as guardrails and we're spending more in cyber today. We're spending more on all things risk. On the other hand, we've not yet pulled out all of our expenses around loss mitigation. We continue to make investments in distribution. So I guess a range is a range and I can't guarantee with the lower end, but if we were at the high end that's also acceptable. In our mind, if we're making the right investments, in the right things and eliminating expenses where we think they can be eliminated. So that's how we feel about it. Mike Mayo : And then last follow-up the cyber expenses or the all things risk expenses, have these ticked up some, or is this kind of what you had expected? John Shrewsberry : They've ticked up in the terms of we continue to make more investments there and we're starting to get the annualization of expenses we made last year. And we'll get more efficient in that over time, but we're spending -- we're spending the money we think we need to spend. And sometimes that's hiring consultants and then over time you can convert whatever they're doing to team members, which tends to be more efficient, you're not as efficient in every process, the minute you adopted it or employ it, but more money has been spent there. Mike Mayo : All there. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. John Stumpf : Good morning. Matt O\u2019Connor: If I could follow-up on the net interest margin was down just two basis points, which I think was very good in this kind of environment. As I look at some of the underlying detail on the yields of the securities and some of the loan yields. I guess I don't totally understand how they've been so stable and wondering if there is anything you can add on maybe first the securities, you've been growing it and the yields have been remarkably resilient. John Shrewsberry : It's just math. What we've been growing hasn\u2019t been that extraordinary in terms of its incremental contribution to the way that it average because the denominators is big as it is. If we continue to deploy as I know you know, if we continue deploying in this environment, ultimately it will start to skew down the way it averaged return and also we've been tending to invest in treasury and agency securities and just from a credit quality point of view, that's going to bring down returns, setting aside the historical book yields versus current book yields and the shape of the current when the investments were made. If we've got corporates and munis and some other things in the starting portfolio, if we're just adding U.S. treasuries, it's going to bring things down, but it just hasn\u2019t revealed itself yet because the numbers haven\u2019t been big enough yet. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then on the loan yields, I guess they've been surprisingly resilient as well. Do you feel like -- I know it's a blend of eight or ten categories the way you disclose it, but do you feel like generally speaking loan yields have stabilized and I am looking at the C&I that was actually up a couple bips, but really up and down the portfolio. It feels like there has been pretty good stability the last three or four quarters. John Shrewsberry : I think that's right. We're in fiercely competitive markets. Not every bit of composition is in the last phase. It's point of spread on a loan. Sometimes it's in the structure of a loan and of course there are places we'll back away from when that happens, but it is competitive, but it hasn\u2019t all shown up in price. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then I mean I just -- I guess putting it all together as you think about the next margin percent going forward, probably largely dependent on loan growth, but how do you think it shapes out? Obviously the rates where they are doesn\u2019t help but is it just as modest pressure of is there more material pressure to come? John Shrewsberry : It depends on the pace of continued deposit inflows and how that gets redeployed. If deposits remain steady where they are, then the loan growth and the redeployment from cash into investment securities is going to be very supportive of the Inco. If we get keep getting high single-digit or even low double-digit deposit growth and it doesn\u2019t make and loan growth isn\u2019t happening at the same pace where redeploying into investment securities doesn\u2019t make sense at the same pace, then the math is going to put pressure on that calculation. And as you know, that's not a calculation we're managing to. It's an outcome of the other things that we're doing, but the driver there is the growth in deposit and how you responsibly deploy that into either loans or securities in the same timeframe that the deposits are coming in. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. All right makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. John Stumpf : Hi Betsy. John Shrewsberry : Hi Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hey, I had a question on investment spend and thoughts around mobile wallet with Apple Pay obviously you did a lot of work there, is there an opportunity to take those investments and potentially expand them into mobile wallet, real time banking other tokenization strategies? John Shrewsberry : Well we're doing a lot of work in all those things, but the so called paperless store and doing real time cash letters and helping customers with real-time information not understanding which channel they're involved. And so I would say all the above is important. What we've found, which is interesting is that our most loyal customers today are ones who use the channels most often and the most types of channels. So even for those customers who are very advanced technology and use of technology, ease of technology who might be dominant in that channel, still visit stores on a infrequent but regular basis. They go to ATMs. So there is lots of things. And we're making -- some of the investments we're making is to set up an appointment with the banker using your technology. We're testing things about being able to authenticate customers knowing they are in the stores, working on things that would authenticate an ATM machine, maybe using your mobile on. So there is mobile devices, so there is just lots of things going on there. And we're actually leaning a lot of those things from retailers and other service providers outside of our industry. So pretty exciting stuff. Betsy Graseck : And do you feel this is like table stakes and will just maintain share or do you think that you're doing things that could potentially drive share up, drive down that expense ratio? John Shrewsberry : Well I think about less or an expense ratio, but these are more than table -- while they're table stakes in some cases, if you don't have a mobile offering, you're probably not going to serve most millennials today. But we think of it more than table stakes. We think it's a big reason why we're growing net new primary tech new account where we're 5% a year. The positive growth we've had clearly is a result of -- partially a result of our distribution model and the Omni channel view we have of these various channels, not separate businesses, but combined into really centric around the customer needs and convenience. And our growth is I think reflective of our commitment to that. Betsy Graseck : And I guess I am just wondering too on a Dillard\u2019s because I would expect that retailers also want best-in-class mobile apps etcetera, is this part of what we should expect you'll be delivering to Dillard\u2019s and other private liable portfolios that you're in? John Shrewsberry : Well I don't want to speak about a particular situation, but I'll just give you this. 16 years ago, we didn't have an online offering. Today over 80% of the customers are actively online, some 28 million or 24 million customers actively online on the consumer side. Five years ago we didn't have a mobile offering. Today we have over 14 million customers on that. I mean mobile is the fastest growing, fastest adopted channel we've had in our history of our company. And the things that customers can now do mobally and the things that they\u2019ll be able to do in the next year or two as we continue to introduce new capabilities is really exciting. So watch for this. It's really important. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. John Stumpf : Good morning. John Pancari : On the -- kick the energy horse here again, so my apologies, but first of all can you just help quantify your total leverage loan book what the size is? And then of that leverage loan book, how much of it is energy? John Stumpf : Sure, so we don't have a leverage loan book. We have loan portfolios in various lines of business. We have an energy loan portfolio, which would include both oil and gas and as I mentioned, it's about 2% of our loans overall and it includes E&P companies. It includes mid stream, pipeline companies and it includes services companies. It also includes some investment grade integrated oil names. But some of that is about 2% of our total loan portfolio. Some of those companies will have higher leverage. Some of those companies will have lower leverage, but we don't draw the portfolio line along the level of leverage. John Pancari : Okay. And then separately related to that, do you have the amount of bond exposure that you may have held in your trading portfolios for any deals that you've done in the energy sector? Do you have that quantified? John Stumpf : Yes, it's a good question. So I'll quantify for you our total securities exposure including what's in trading and also what's in AFS because we have some -- we have some corporate investments in energy names as well. And the sum total of both of those is less than a $1.5 billion at Wells Fargo and it's much smaller portion in trading which of course gives mark-to-market through the P&L every day and somewhat larger percentage of that is sitting in AFS, which we mark every day, but the value change goes through OCI. John Pancari : Okay. All right. And then separately on the loan growth I agree good pick up that we saw in C&I for the quarter, and as we look out into 2015, is it fair to assume that you should see some acceleration in the loan growth that you're looking at for 2015 versus what you achieved in 2014. I think you're in the 4% to 5% range for 2014. Is it fair to assume that, that accelerates from there next year or for the full year 2015? John Shrewsberry : I think knowing what we know about the economy today, we feel better about the next four quarters than couple of the last four quarters. So if the most recent quarter is the continuation of a two quarter trend, then yes, we'll probably have higher loan growth or higher amounts originated. Now if the denominator keeps growing as we grow the size of the portfolio and at some point the rate gets impacted by that. But yes, it feels like a good year for loan growth. John Stumpf : You know John, we think if you're going to grow revenues over the long run, you have to be growing households, cross-sell deposits and loans and we share a plan for all of those. John Pancari : Okay. All right. And my last question. I know there are some questions around the excess liquidity reinvestment and what you've been buying, I know you indicate you're buying treasuries and agencies. Do you have what durations and what yields that you purchased in the quarter? Just to get an idea of what the ultimate impact could be on the margin? John Shrewsberry : Yes, we don't lay out quite that way. You'll see in our tables what we're talking about, but its treasuries and agencies you know the timeframe and I can tell you we're in the intermediate part of the curve. So that will probably get you there. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Good morning. John Stumpf : Good morning, Eric. Oh Regina, he dropped. Operator : Eric, your line is open. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi, can you hear me? John Stumpf : Yes, hi Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : Oh! Hi. That was an odd, because I was not on mute and I have the telephone at least once before. Just to follow-up on the OpEx for a moment, I understand the discussion of the ratio, but just in terms of absolute level, based on what I am hearing in terms of your loan growth expectation, it sounds like we should be anticipating an absolute level of expense that is higher than what we saw in 2014. Is that correct? John Stumpf : It's really tough to say, which is why we're talking percentages and think about things in terms of a range and you can see the items that we're calling out as feeling seasonal in Q4 and there is a handful of them and there an amount to a few $100 million. And then of course in Q1, we typically have escalated personnel in benefits expense as well. In terms of the OpEx of the investments that we're making in risk management etcetera, they will be elevated for some period of time, but because of all of the other drivers to the total expense number. It's possible that we operate and there is a reasonable expectation that we operate at a lower level than we have in the last couple of quarters because we're always pushing down on things where we can. So that's why we give you the range. We think we're going to be in the range in 2015 like we have been in 2014. One other item I had mentioned for those other new two that we do have this deferred comp element that shows up in expense even though it's a P&L neutral item and that creates in some cases a couple $100 million worth of noise in any given quarter, which is material given the differences that we're talking about here. John Shrewsberry : But Eric even though we're at the high end of the range now, one should not assume that it's not top of mind around here, it is. It is. It range top of mind and it's always looking for opportunities to be more efficient, but also continue to invest in the future because we do have a long term view. Eric Wasserstrom : Right. Of course. And the financing that you provided on the student loan sale, what is the expected duration of that? John Shrewsberry : So that financing probably comes down over the course of next couple of years on a relatively steep curve as the portfolio gets permanently financed into student loan ABS and so my expectation I think the reasonable expectation is that it's average life would be maybe a little bit more than a year as it comes down. Eric Wasserstrom : Got it. And just quickly one last thing, the tax benefit that you mentioned in the period from the change in federal tax law, is that a permanent benefit and what should we expect for your kind of go forward GAAP tax rate? John Shrewsberry : So what happened in the fourth quarter is both the impact of the extender legislation that came in at the end of the year as well as the resolution of some discrete matters that we've been working on with the various taxing authorities for some period of time. I would look at recent prior years for what the reason of what a good expectation is for a tax rate going forward. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. So largely unchanged, it sounds like. John Shrewsberry : Yes, I think that's right. Eric Wasserstrom : All right. Thanks very much. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio with KBW. Please go ahead. Chris Mutascio : Good morning, guys; Happy New Year to you. John Stumpf : Happy New Year to you, Chris. Chris Mutascio : I have a quick question for John Shrewsberry, you noted that your investment securities portfolio was increasing quite materially over last year; I think it's up about $50 billion. Can you tell me what portion of that is Ginnie Mae, MBS? How much is that Ginnie Mae portfolio. If you have exposure has it grown in '14? John Shrewsberry : It's negligible. Chris Mutascio : Okay. Because I am assuming the refinance activity there with a 50 basis point cut, plus rates being down, I didn't know what the impact would be perhaps on the margin, but your Ginnie Mae exposure is negligible. John Shrewsberry : Negligible. Chris Mutascio : All right. Thank you very much. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning, guys. John Stumpf : Happy New Year, Nancy. Nancy Bush : Happy New Year. Two questions for you. John you mentioned the changes at in the GSEs and at the FHA with regard to allowable mortgages etcetera. There seems to have been a remarkable turnaround in Washington since the days the financial crises when everybody was cracking down on mortgages and we're in a reverse posture now. As a result of this, do you see any changes that you might make at the mortgage company in terms of businesses that you exited, the wholesale business etcetera that you might want to go back and revisit? John Stumpf : No, well first of all, I think those are positive changes that have been made and I think they've been largely made because it got too restrictive and customers who deserved a loan, who wanted to buy a home could afford it, could not get credit. And I am not -- I don't want to overstate the amount of those folks, but there was that element and I think we've come to a much better place with regulators, with the industry and with customers. But no, we don't have an intention of going back into joint ventures or the wholesale business. We like the business mix we have now. Nancy Bush : Okay. Second question is this. There was -- I believe a heard on the Street column a few days ago in the Wall Street Journal about the impact of the energy price drop on various banks and John I think they mentioned that the figure of 17% of revenues comes to mind with regard to your capital markets businesses related to energy. Could you just clarify that where you stand in capital markets with relation to the energy business and is there going to be a big impact in revenues there? John Stumpf : So in that article they referred to I think geologic information for 2014 that suggested that we had about $280 million worth of underwriting revenue from energy related activity. So that would be debt and equity underwriting and probably loan syndication fees as well. So that's the order of magnitude. The 17% would refer to that as a percentage of the investment banking revenue -- U.S. investment banking revenue for full year of 2014. So if in terms of at risk or where it goes from here, that's a starting point for last year. And it bounced around between I don't know, $150 million and maybe $300 million over the course of the last several years. Nancy Bush : Okay. And just one more question John Stumpf for you, you've been very positive on the direction of the American economy for the last couple of quarters and I think you remain that way. Well I don't know if you saw your predecessor Mr. Kovacevich on CNBC a couple of mornings ago and he was not so positive on the strength of the American economy. I am sure you still talk to Dick from time to time and sort of what is behind the differing views? John Stumpf : What was his name again? Nancy Bush : That K guy. John Stumpf : Oh! The K guy. Well I obviously respect Dick's view and there are different views in the economy, but that being said when I -- and there is volatility clearly. Today, look at retail sales and if I feel differently, so you can feel differently on a day to day basis. But when I look at the businesses that we're in and as I am talking with customers which I am every day and talking with our business leaders and frankly looking at the numbers, 50 consecutive months of employment growth. Unemployment in the five, six range. GDP 5% and will probably have a few quarters this year that start with 3%. So I am optimistic. I don't think -- again I don't think this is a breakout, but I think we're on the front foot and consumer's confidence is at a all time high since the downturn. So the way I read the tea leaves, I'm optimistic. John Shrewsberry : I think Dick also suggest that we could have gotten here sooner. We could be at higher levels\u2026 John Stumpf : And actually I agree with that. Nancy Bush : Okay. Thanks very much. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Hello and well, glad to have wrap it up for you. If you look at the capital deployment ratios, if you look at your total payout this quarter of 72%, which is I think close to your stated target you talked about around 75%. So the increased capital deployment from here, are you going to need to see some earnings momentum or do you think you could push pass at 75% payout ratio? John Shrewsberry : So our target is 55% to 75% and you saw that it bounced around during the course of the four quarters of 2014 for a few reasons. One of them is that we do more share issuance in connection with our benefit plans in the first half of the year and so it drives down the net payout ratio. The first call on our capital is to be available to support more loan growth on behalf of our customers. So the capital deployment horse is out in front of the net payout cart and that's important to remember because we're not hoping that we have enough to support the business growth after we think about distribution. We're making sure we have enough to support the business growth and then we're factoring in distribution behind that. So we anticipate continuing to operate in the range quarter by quarter, 55% to 75% and the fourth quarter was a high take on that in the 70s. Marty Mosby : And that was really kind of looking back towards the E part of that, which is as earnings grow, that gives you more chance, what kind of catalyst do you see until -- while we're waiting on interest rates to create some incremental earnings momentum kind of reigniting that, that we've seen kind of slow down over the last couple of quarters? John Stumpf : Sure, well its loan growth for sure. It's redeployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding earning assets. It will be what the impact is on expenses that we've been talking a lot a little bit, if we do as expected there. And then it's the various sources of fee revenue, which have which reflect quarter to quarter, up year-over-year, but there is a lot of momentum in places like card, places like investment banking, trust and investment fees overall. We just talked about the slightly more bullish case for mortgage this year. All of those are catalysts for growth. Marty Mosby : Thanks. John Stumpf : Yes. Thank you. John Stumpf : Thank you. And thanks everybody who joined us today and again Happy New Year to everybody and thanks for your interest in Wells Fargo. See you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference. Jim Rowe : Thank you, Regina, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf. John Stumpf : Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We earned $5.8 billion in the first quarter, which reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and our continued focus on the real economy. By building relationships with our existing customers and successfully generating new relationships during the past year, we were able to grow loans and deposits and increase our revenue. Our capital levels remained strong and we continued to focus on rewarding our shareholders by increasing our dividend and reducing our shares outstanding. Let me highlight our growth during the quarter compared with a year ago. We generated $21.3 billion of revenue, up 3% from a year ago with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. We had broad-based loan growth with our core loan portfolio increasing by $54.2 billion or 7%. Our deposit franchise continued to generate strong customer and balanced growth with total deposits reaching a record $1.2 trillion, up $102.1 billion or 9%, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.7%. Our credit performance continued to be very strong with net charge-offs down $117 million and our net charge-off ratio declined to 33 basis points. Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation and returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority. Our net payout ratio was 61% in the first quarter. We\u2019re extremely pleased that our 2015 capital plan allows us to increase our quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.375 per common share for the second quarter of this year, of course subject to board approval. Our ability to increase our dividend every year since 2011 demonstrates the benefits of our diversified business model and conservative risk management, as well as our disciplined capital management process. We have over 90 different businesses that are benefiting from the continued strength in the U.S. economy. While the first quarter economic headlines again demonstrated that the economic recovery has been uneven, I believe the underlying economic expansion that is approaching its sixth anniversary remains largely on track. Interest rates remain low, homes are affordable, consumer and small business confidence remains high, and the labor market is approaching full employment after a record 54 consecutive monthly payroll gains. I\u2019m optimistic that the improving U.S. economy will continue to provide Wells Fargo with many opportunities to better serve our customers, our communities, and reward our shareholders. John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John? John Shrewsberry : Thanks John, and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. Wells Fargo had another strong quarter, earning $5.8 billion and $1.04 in EPS in the first quarter and returning net $3.3 billion of capital to shareholders. Our results were driven by average loan and deposit growth and lower expenses while we maintained our strong capital and liquidity positions. Our results also benefited from a net $359 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter primarily from a reduction in the reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the resolution of prior period matters with U.S. federal and state taxing authorities. As a reminder, we also had a $423 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of last year. We take a prudent approach in accounting for our tax liability, which can result in discrete tax benefits depending on the resolution of prior period matters with taxing authorities. Page 3 highlights our results compared with a year ago, including increased revenue and pre-tax pre-provision profit, strong loan and deposit growth, and lower share count reflecting net share repurchases. Page 4 highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income in the first quarter. The benefit of the diversity of our 90-plus businesses was demonstrated by our ability to grow both net interest income and non-interest income in the first quarter compared with a year ago, which was a key driver of our performance. As I\u2019ve highlighted in the past, the drivers of our fee generation vary based on interest rates and economic conditions. For example, market-sensitive revenue, which includes trading and gains from debt and equity investments, declined 22% from a year ago, dropping from 14% to fee income to 11%. However, other businesses had strong growth and we generated higher trust and investment, card and mortgage banking fee income. With this broad-based growth, we were able to grow fee income 3% from a year ago. Let me highlight some key drivers of our first quarter results from a balance sheet and income statement perspective, starting on Page 5. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We generated core loan and deposit growth and have increased liquidity and capital to record levels. Let me take a minute to describe how we\u2019re managing in the current rate environment. We\u2019ve been able to perform well across a variety of rate cycles over time because of the diversification of the business model. We\u2019re often asked about how we manage our interest rate risk, in particular the timing of making investments in a lower rate environment. As you might imagine, we evaluate our interest rate risk position continuously and frequently weigh options to alter the overall sensitivity of the balance sheet. We consider factors such as the expected growth in loans and deposits performance under a wide range of rate scenarios and the trade-offs between the protection from lower rates afforded by adding duration, and the consequences of those actions in higher rate scenarios. Based upon these analyses, we then make decisions about the kind of instruments we use. We can purchase securities outright or extend the duration of variable rate loans with interest rate swaps and the magnitude and profile of the duration we add. All in all, we try to balance a number of considerations and maintain flexibility as conditions evolve. Turning to the income statement on Page 6, revenue declined from fourth quarter as net interest income was lower, reflecting two fewer days in the first quarter and lower income from variable sources; however, non-interest income grew from the fourth quarter even though the fourth quarter included a $217 million gain on the sale of government-guaranteed student loans. The growth in fee income reflected momentum across our businesses, which I\u2019ll highlight throughout the call. As shown on Page 7, we continued to have strong broad-based loan growth in the first quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $54.2 billion or 7% from a year ago, and was up $914 million from the fourth quarter. Linked quarter commercial loan growth was driven by real estate, construction and lease financing. Consumer loans grew slightly as growth in non-conforming mortgage, auto, security-based lending, and student loans was largely offset by payoffs in the junior lien portfolio and seasonality in credit cards. On Page 8, we highlight our loan portfolios that had strong year-over-year growth. C&I loans were up $31.9 billion or 13% from a year ago, with broad-based growth across most of our wholesale businesses. Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $13 billion or 7% from a year ago, reflecting continued growth in high-quality non-conforming mortgages, primarily jumbo loans. The credit quality of our core mortgage portfolio remains strong with only 7 basis points of credit losses in the first quarter. Credit card balances were up $4 billion or 15% from a year ago, benefiting from strong new account growth and the Dillards portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter. Auto loans were up $3.7 billion or 7% from last year. While we continued to benefit from the strong auto market, new originations were down 10% from a year ago, reflecting our continued risk and pricing discipline in a competitive market. As you can see on Page 9, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $97.5 billion from a year ago and up $25 billion from fourth quarter. Our average deposit cost was 9 basis points, consistent with the fourth quarter and down 2 basis points from a year ago. We successfully grew primary consumer checking customers by 5.7% from a year ago and primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5.5%. Our ability to consistently grow primary checking customers is important because these customers have more interactions with us, have higher cross-sell, and are more than twice as profitable as non-primary checking customers. We grew net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis by $396 million or 4% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets, up $170 billion or 12%. Net interest income declined $190 million from fourth quarter due to two fewer days in the first quarter and lower variable income. The net interest margin declined 9 basis points from the fourth quarter due to strong customer-driven deposit growth. This reduced the margin by 5 basis points but had minimal impact to net interest income. Lower interest income from variable sources due to reduced loan fees and PCI loan recoveries decreased the margin by 3 basis points. Liquidity-related activity, which was not LCR-related but taken to demonstrate market access and the liquidity of our securities portfolio, reduced the margin by 1 basis point. All other balance sheet and repricing did not impact the margin in the first quarter. Our balance sheet remained asset-sensitive and we\u2019re well positioned to benefit from higher rates. We believe we can grow net interest income in 2015 compared with 2014 even if rates remain low, as we demonstrated last year. Total non-interest income increased $29 million from fourth quarter and grew $282 million from a year ago, up 3%. Trading gains increased $229 million from fourth quarter, primarily from higher customer accommodation trading, reflecting better markets in high grade/high yield and RNBS, as well as seasonality. Mortgage banking revenue increased $32 million from fourth quarter on higher origination volume, up $5 billion or 11%. Fifty-five percent of originations were for refinancing, up from 40% in the fourth quarter as rates declined. We ended the quarter with a $44 billion application pipeline, the highest pipeline since the second quarter of 2013, and we expect funding volumes to increase in the second quarter given the size of the pipeline and the seasonal home buying that typically occurs during the second quarter spring buying season. Our gain on sale ratio increased to 2.06% in the first quarter as pricing margins expanded, reflecting strong refinance volume and lenders priced to balance volumes and capacity. We currently expect the second quarter gain on sale ratio to be at the higher end of the range we\u2019ve seen over the past five quarters, 140 basis points to 206 basis points. Servicing income declined $162 million from the fourth quarter as MSR results declined $127 million, reflecting higher prepayment expectations associated with reductions in FHA mortgage insurance premiums. This valuation adjustment directly reduced our servicing results in the quarter. As shown on Page 12, expenses were down $140 million from the fourth quarter. Our first quarter expenses included $452 million of seasonally higher employee benefits expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401k matching, as well as $236 million for annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. These seasonally higher expenses were offset by lower salaries, reflecting two fewer days in the quarter, lower revenue-based incentive compensation and reduced outside professional services, equipment, travel and entertainment, and advertising expenses. While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense, reflecting high day count and annual merit increases, and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter, such as outside professional services and advertising expenses, are also expected to increase. Our efficiency ratio improved to 58.8% in the first quarter, and we expect the efficiency ratio for the full year 2015 to remain within our targeted range of 55 to 59%. Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.7 billion in the first quarter, down 5% from a year ago and up 7% from the fourth quarter. As I highlighted earlier, we had continued strong growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 5.7% from a year ago. Our broad-based and industry-leading distribution channels are one reason for this growth. While our customers actively use all of our channels, including more than 75% of our deposit customers visiting a banking store at least once within the last six months, mobile banking is growing the fastest. We had 14.9 million active mobile customers, up 19% from a year ago. Our customers are increasingly using this channel with mobile banking sessions up 38% in 2014, while customer usage of our stores has remained stable. We also continue to successfully grow retail bank households. February was our highest monthly net gain of retail bank households in four years. These new households provide us with growth opportunities as we focus on meeting their financial needs through our diversified product line. An example of how we\u2019re capturing this opportunity is in our debit and credit card businesses, with card fees up 11% from a year ago. Debit card purchase volume was up 8% and credit card purchase volume increased 16% from a year ago. Our credit card business continued to have strong new account growth and active account growth. Wholesale banking earned $1.8 billion in the first quarter, up 3% from a year ago and down 9% from fourth quarter. Loan growth continued to be strong with average loans up $35.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, with broad-based growth across many businesses. We\u2019re excited about our announcement last week regarding the purchase of $9 billion of commercial real estate mortgage loans from GE Capital. This is a portfolio of performing loans primarily in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Canada, which are active lending markets for us. We also agreed to provide $4 billion of financing to Blackstone Mortgage Trust for their purchase of a commercial mortgage portfolio. We expect these transactions to close in the second and third quarters of this year. This is an excellent example of how the combination of our balance sheet strength, the expertise of our team members and our relationship focus positions us to capture opportunities for growth, both organically and through acquisition. While we remain disciplined in deposit pricing, we continue to benefit from strong deposit growth with average core deposits up $44.4 billion or 17% from a year ago. Wholesale banking also had broad-based fee growth, up 11% from a year ago with many of our diversified businesses growing at double digits. Investment banking fees grew 44% from a year ago, and we increased our market share to 4.9%. This growth reflected continued improvement in our equity capital markets and investment-grade originations. Treasury management revenue grew 11%, reflecting new product sales and repricing. Wealth brokerage and retirement earned a record $561 million in first quarter, up 18% from a year ago and up 9% from fourth quarter. WBR\u2019s pre-tax margin was 24% in the first quarter, close to their long-term target of 25%. These strong results reflected 8% revenue growth from a year ago driven by 12% growth in net interest income and 8% growth in asset-based fees. The partnership between WBR and community banking has been successful, generating over $1 billion a month in closed referred investment assets. During the past year, 58% of referred assets were from new investment clients of Wells Fargo. We\u2019re also benefiting from increasing our license to private bankers in our banking stores by 15% from a year ago. This partnership has also contributed to the growth in brokerage advisory assets, which were $435 billion, up 12% from a year ago. WBR\u2019s strong loan growth continued, up 14% from a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. This growth was driven primarily by an increase in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security-based lending. Turning to Page 16, credit quality in the first quarter remained strong with our net charge-off ratio declining to 33 basis points of average loans. Non-performing assets have declined for 10 consecutive quarters and were down $618 million from fourth quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $338 million and foreclosed assets declined $280 million. The reserve release was $100 million in the first quarter, down $150 million from fourth quarter and down $400 million from a year ago. Let me update you on our energy portfolio. We had $18.5 billion of oil and gas loans at the end of the first quarter, or 2% of total loans outstanding. The size of this portfolio was relatively stable from fourth quarter, up only $65 million. Approximately 55% of our portfolio was in the exploration and production, or upstream sector. We\u2019ve been an industry leader in the energy sector for over 40 years, and we take a disciplined approach to not only underwriting but also managing these loans and relationships. Our teams constantly monitor and evaluate this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis. In the first quarter, we performed an even greater review of each loan in this portfolio, and in March we began the spring redetermination process for our reserve-based loans. We realized minimal credit losses related to energy loans in the first quarter and our allowance at the end of the first quarter contemplated the inherent credit losses associated with our oil and gas exposure. Our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel III, using the advanced approach fully phased in at 10.53% in the first quarter. Last month, the Federal Reserve and the OCC announced that we may begin using the advanced approach\u2019s capital framework starting in the second quarter. This approval did not include stipulations requiring us to increase our current advanced approach RWA. We returned $3.3 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and net share repurchases. Our common shares outstanding declined by 7 million shares in the first quarter, reflecting 48 million shares purchased during the quarter partially offset by 41 million shares issued, primarily through employee benefit plans which are seasonally high in the first quarter. In addition, we entered into a $750 million forward repurchase contract that settled earlier this month for 14 million shares. We expect to reduce our common shares outstanding through share repurchases throughout the remainder of the year. As John noted earlier on the call, our 2015 capital plan included a proposed increase to our second quarter dividend to $0.375 per common share, subject to board approval. In summary, the first quarter demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, as shown by the results we highlight on Slide 19. Through our consistent focus on serving our customers in the real economy, we have realized growth across many of our businesses that will help drive future momentum. We\u2019ve grown primary consumer checking and small business and business banking checking customers. We\u2019ve added new credit card accounts, increased debit card purchase volume, and achieved strong retail bank household growth. Mortgage originations have grown, commercial card volume has increased, and we\u2019ve grown investment banking market share. Treasury management fees have grown at a double-digit rate. We\u2019ve increased assets under management, and we have higher retail brokerage managed account assets. I\u2019m optimistic that our diversified business model will continue to generate opportunities for growth and will enable us to continue to invest in our businesses. We will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. Thank you so much for giving us a detailed rundown in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about your liquidity strategy. I also appreciate the $28.4 billion in deposit growth came from consumer and escrow, but taking a step back, of the $1.2 trillion in period-end deposits, how much would you classify as non-operational corporate? I guess we\u2019re just wondering is adopting a similar strategy as your other large bank peers on non-operating deposits, will that be able to alleviate some of the liquidity pressure on the NIM without much give-up on the LCR? John Shrewsberry : It\u2019s a good question, and I\u2019d say the answer is we\u2019re not impacted in the same way as some of the other banks who have gone to the measures that they have announced to discourage those types of deposits. We\u2019re not constrained by the leverage ratio at this point. We\u2019re not meaningfully impacted by institutional non-operational deposits in our GSIB score, and so we\u2019re serving institutional customers and in some cases taking their deposits if it makes sense in the context of the bigger relationship, but we\u2019re not in the same position as the couple of banks who have had to go out of their way to drive down either leverage--change their leverage outcome or drive down their GSIB score. So we will--we\u2019re thinking about those relationships in a way where we can do the most good for Wells Fargo shareholders, so if other people are charging more or are consolidating business activity to be willing to take those deposits, there\u2019s an opportunity for us to improve our business with those same types of customers, but it\u2019s not quite as urgent because we don\u2019t have those problems. Erika Najarian : I guess a better way to think about it is a lot of this excess deposit growth is going to be positive for your LCR and NSFR, given that it looks like it\u2019s mostly retail, so low outflow, high ASF factor type of deposits. John Stumpf : That\u2019s correct. And Erika, the other thing that I know you\u2019re aware of, we love the entire relationships, so surely on the retail side but it\u2019s even true on the wholesale side. When we become the primary account holder, or think of it as a financial partner with a customer and deposits lead with that, good things happen. So that\u2019s all part of serving customers broadly and deeply. Erika Najarian : Just as a follow-up, then I\u2019ll step back, you\u2019ve been very consistent in terms of falling in that 55 to 59% efficiency ratio range, and you\u2019re consistent in terms of your forward guidance. Again, given some of the other large bank guidance in efficiency out there, will it take rates for Wells Fargo to move further down to the 55% portion of that range? John Shrewsberry : Well, that would be one way to do it. An increase in rates, which would have an increase in revenue without a lot of associated expense, would do that. There are other ways to move a little bit lower in the range, depending on the mix of where revenue comes from and the initiatives that we have to manage expenses. But we\u2019re comfortable in the range, we\u2019re at the higher end of the range today, which is still an industry-leading level, and these other folks who are enacting their efficiency plans are coming towards us so we\u2019re going to keep doing what we\u2019re doing. John Stumpf : But we\u2019re not standing still. We watch every expense around here as we repurpose dollars we save into things that we have to invest in. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you, good morning. Can you put into context for us whether the investment opportunities that you discussed that you see before you at the moment are--do you see them as growing, or are they getting harder to identify as you look ahead at, say, the next 12 months versus the last 12 months? Then relating to these investment opportunities, how should we be thinking about the trajectory of your payout ratio longer term? As you generate more capital going forward, is it fair just to view your payout ratio as being inversely related to your investment opportunities? I guess I\u2019m asking from the perspective of kind of general overall view that higher payout ratios are better, but I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s really how we should be thinking about it for Wells Fargo, given that your capital position is already largely optimized and you\u2019re not sitting on a lot of excess capital at the moment, so whether or not we should be thinking about that. John Shrewsberry : So by investment opportunities, are you referring to our deployment of liquidity, or are you referring to, like the GE Capital case, where we\u2019re buying a portfolio of loans with customers? Bill Carcache : I think the GE Capital case, any other RWA growth for attractive return generation. John Shrewsberry : So serving our customers and deploying our capital in that way is the first call on our capital. We\u2019re trying to grow earning assets with customers with cross-sell benefit and create new and bigger relationships with customers that we have. So certainly a certain amount of that factored into our capital plan, so that we are imagining doing that while returning capital to shareholders at a high level; but if the landscape were to shift so that the opportunity became more meaningful for us to originate more assets and in some cases acquire more assets that are good for us, then I think we\u2019d be looking long and hard at that. John Stumpf : As far as the return on capital to shareholders, I think our record speaks for itself, and I know John mentioned it in his comments that we very much appreciate investment our shareholders have made in us and that we\u2019re stewards of their capital, and returning as much of that as is prudent is what we plan on doing and want to do. There is no reason for us just to keep adding capital. On the other hand, first call is to grow the business, as John mentioned, and we will return as much, as I mentioned, as we prudently can, as you just saw recently with our increase in our dividend, or at least the ability to increase the dividend. John Shrewsberry : And the trick, of course, is to only take advantage of investment opportunities that are capable of generating the kind of return on equity that we\u2019ve been generating, and to keep distributions up to keep our capital level at the point - you use the term optimized - so that we\u2019re not carrying excess capital that\u2019s harder to produce that return on. That\u2019s the balance. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s very helpful. My last question is on the dynamic that we\u2019re seeing with loan growth outpacing deposit growth across the banking system as a whole, but for the larger banks, including Wells Fargo, I guess we\u2019re still seeing deposit growth outpacing loan growth. I was hoping that you could just talk about what you think may be driving that, and do you see anything on the horizon that you think could change that; in other words, just lead to loan growth outpacing deposit growth at the large banks as well. John Shrewsberry : Well, I think every large bank has a slightly different business mix, and so whatever accounts for their loan growth is going to be unique to them. In our case, because we\u2019ve done such a good job at attracting retail households and attracting wholesale relationships that are bringing meaningful liquidity in, deposit growth has been outpacing loan growth for some time, and it would take a big move in loan growth - which could include utilization of existing credit facilities or incremental funded loans - in order to catch up with that. It would have to be in a higher economic growth environment, I think, for loan growth to get into the 9% range, which is where deposits have been. Now, if we\u2019re buying portfolios of loans like we are in the next couple of quarters, that will certainly have an impact on that, but that\u2019s not probably something that you would project into the future at that same pace. So I don\u2019t see that turning around in the near term. John Stumpf : In fact, these are some of the strongest deposit growth years I\u2019ve seen in my 30-some years with the company, and I think it\u2019s partly because of the way we work together as a company, our distribution, the convenience we provide for customers, our focus on this. So it\u2019s been very strong, and all signs are that we\u2019ll continue to have a very strong deposit growth profile. John Shrewsberry : And at 9 basis points, it\u2019s not as though we\u2019re overpaying. John Stumpf : No, exactly. Bill Carcache : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. John, we wanted to just go back to the efficiency ratio. Is it reasonable to expect as long as rates stay low and credit is as good as it is right now, you\u2019re likely to stay at the upper end of your targeted range? I think John Shrewsberry, you said last call you\u2019d be okay staying at the higher end of the--you know, in this kind of environment. Is there any expenses that are kind of still cyclically elevated? Maybe just give a little more color there. John Shrewsberry : Yes, we\u2019re continuing to--we\u2019re always looking for ways to be, as John said, as efficiency as we can and to make the most of every dollar we spend. At the same time, now is the time when there are big demands in information security and compliance and risk management, and so if we\u2019re finding dollars on the efficiency side of the ledger, we\u2019re reinvesting them either in products and services for our customers or in becoming best-in-class across all risk management aspects. So that\u2019s probably going to keep us here at the higher end of the range, unless we have a breakout in some revenue category or we have an increase in rates, which is fine. At 58, 59%, it\u2019s still an attractive level to be performing at, and we\u2019re improving our company every day. John McDonald : Okay, and on TLAC, John, is there some thoughts that you could share in terms of preparing for TLAC? The rules, obviously, aren\u2019t finished yet, but are you taking steps to prepare for your assessment of the most likely proposal that you\u2019d see on that front? John Shrewsberry : Sure, so we\u2019ve got a variety of analyses of most likely or best case/worst case, and they look a lot like what\u2019s out there in the public domain. We\u2019re going to end up issuing more term debt during the phase-in period, and we\u2019ll probably start in the relatively near term to leg into it so that we don\u2019t end up with an enormous overhang that has to be issued in a short amount of time. There\u2019s still a lot to know--oh, go ahead? John McDonald : Oh no, sorry, I was going to say is it preferred as well? If you could just kind of weigh in on preferreds relative to where you think you might need to be. John Shrewsberry : Yeah, well there\u2019s a little bit of preferred left to leg into our capital plan, but not much. And of course, there might be more if there\u2019s RWA growth and the whole capital stack expands pro rata. I think we\u2019re at 149 basis points of preferred today, and our target is 150, so we\u2019re pretty close there. But if we grow RWA, then there\u2019s an opportunity for more of that. The big job to do is going to be on the senior unsecured side, and so we need to know what the total quantum is as a result of where we end up in the 16 to 20 range as a base. We need to know what\u2019s included and excluded, and there\u2019s still things on that list that are being resolved both in the international and domestic standard. And then, we need to know the exact phase-in period, which we think we know. So when you look at those calculations with what we have maturing or otherwise running off, and then as I mentioned growth in RWA, that will lead us to what our annual issuance has to be to get there on time when the rule is final. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning. John, I was wondering if you could provide any color to help us understand on the new loan purchases, is there any way to put in context either the yield of the portfolio relative to the existing yield of the Wells Fargo book, and do you bring over expenses with it or is it largely just interest income coming over, as has happened in your prior acquisitions of loan books? John Shrewsberry : So the yield on the portfolio looks a lot like our commercial real estate portfolio today, because the loans look a lot like our commercial real estate loan portfolio today, and it\u2019s not coming over with material expense. I think we probably will have to add some small number of incremental people, but as you know, we\u2019re the largest commercial real estate lender in the U.S. today and we\u2019ve got a big, seasoned team all over the country that\u2019s close to borrowers and close to properties. That\u2019s the core team that will be managing the portfolio. If we\u2019re adding people, it\u2019s in the tens or maybe dozens of incremental professionals in order to help with asset management, but not a big number in the context of the size of the portfolio. Ken Usdin : Okay. Then as a follow-up, with regard to potential other portfolios that GE had talked about, given your positioning in terms of helping them through the structure, as you mentioned, do you guys get a different look or have you already taken a look at other parts of the book and this is just the first tranche of what could be more, or what\u2019s your general perception of the opportunity set that could come forth for Wells Fargo? John Stumpf : They're a great customer, and we\u2019re trying to continue to help them and work together like we did here. They mentioned in their announcement that there is more to do, and we\u2019ll go through in any way that we can be helpful to them in ways that our good for our shareholders as well. So there is opportunity there - I can\u2019t really be specific about it because there are competitive processes at work, and this is their balance sheet, after all. But we will definitely be working closely together to see if there are other ways that we can help them. Ken Usdin : Okay. One follow-up on your credit comments. Understanding that energy is baked into this quarter and that you still net release reserves, can you just kind of give us the pushes and pulls within the credit buckets in terms of how much more improvement do you continue to see on the rest of the book, ex-the energy side, or have we really just kind of gotten to the end of the natural improvement? John Shrewsberry : Well, there is still meaningful improvement in first mortgage in particular. You\u2019ve seen charge-offs - they continue to come down, NPLs are down. The portfolio is performing very, very well, so as a result, there was room to take stock of what we think the issues are with the energy portfolio and end up with a net reserve release - a modest one, but a net reserve release. So it\u2019s quarter by quarter, we\u2019ll look at it at the end of the second quarter and see what the numbers tell us, but things do continue to improve. John Stumpf : But Ken, I think we should also add that while there is still more improvement to be had on residential, on the other hand our commercial side has been close to or even in a recovery position. That won\u2019t last forever, so there is always pushes and pulls here, but overall credit is really, really doing well here. That\u2019s an industry phenomenon, but especially here at Wells. Ken Usdin : Understood. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Morning guys. Just a couple of quick questions. So John, the tax rate has kind of bumped around, and this quarter obviously you had the discrete issue that you called out. What\u2019s the appropriate FTE tax rate to use going forward? John Shrewsberry : The best way to think about the remainder of the year tax rate is to take the $359 million discrete tax benefit out of the first quarter and then recalculate the tax rate, which would get you to the mid-32s. Scott Siefers : Yes, exactly. Okay, thank you. Then the other one - when you had been talking about the mobile growth, you had noted also that branch use has not been declining. From your perspective, who is coming in and what kind of stuff are they doing, and as you look at overall branch traffic and use and the need for branches, is it a good thing that people are still coming in, in that it makes for an easier, more direct cross-sell, or is it more of a negative in that you have to make mobile investments but you can\u2019t really leverage via fewer branches necessarily, or as much branch reduction as you might hope. How do you think about that dynamic? John Stumpf : Yes, here\u2019s how we think about that. We start out with a customer, and customers tell us branches are important. We hear that every day, and while our other channels are growing - in fact, if you think about the 12,000 consumer interactions we have a minute in this company, 80% or so are what I would call digitally supported, either let\u2019s say online or mobile, and mobile being our fastest growing. But our stores, our 6,200 stores are still busy. Seventy-five percent of our customers come into a store once every six months, even millennials or our most advanced on the digital side visit our stores, visit ATMs. But 85% of our growth sales happen there, providing solutions, so it doesn\u2019t mean we have to build 5,000 or 6,000 square foot stores. As you probably know and we\u2019ve talked in the past, we\u2019ve tried some different concepts where we have 1,000 square foot stores that at night become an ATM vestibule and in the daytime the walls fold in and it becomes a full functioning, digitally-enabled store. We\u2019re doing that kind of thing, but our most loyal customer today is not necessarily the one who has the most products, it\u2019s the customer who does the most things with us, uses the most channels most often. So there is a--and we\u2019re increasingly becoming an information provider. We\u2019re in the information business as much as on the retail we\u2019re in the financial services business, so this is really about connecting all the channels, not about trying to drive customers into what\u2019s cheaper for us. That\u2019s not how we think about that. We think about what\u2019s best for them, and branches still remain an enormously important part in that. Scott Siefers : Okay, that\u2019s good color. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Morford : Good morning, guys. I guess first, compared to the fourth quarter the commercial loan growth was a little slower outside of real estate construction. Was some of that seasonal, or were there other factors in play there? And just in general, how do you feel about the current levels of demand on the commercial side? John Shrewsberry : So the big Q4 to Q1 change is that we closed the sale of the student loan portfolio in Q4, which created a big C&I loan that happened toward the end of the quarter, so the step-up there was from a pretty elevated place. That has an impact in the calculation. I think in the first quarter, we feel good. Pipelines look pretty good. We\u2019ve talked to the leadership of the business and people are active, so from one quarter to the next, tough to tell. The year-over-year trend in C&I loans is really, really healthy, and then that step-up calculation is a little disadvantageous just to the math, but business is good. Joe Morford : Okay. The other question was just curious what your early read is on the spring selling season this year, and are you starting to see any signs of a return of the first-time home buyer? John Stumpf : Well Joe, since we\u2019re a big retail originator, that\u2019s obviously a big opportunity for us. Your question would suggest that the first-time home buyer had been a bit absent in this recovery compared to what it\u2019s been in previous recoveries, but I think some of the work that the industry did along with the GSCs in understanding put-back risk and transfer of risk makes credit a little bit more available. There is a little bit more activity going on, wage increases and increases in employment, that have been helpful. Affordability is really--you know, it\u2019s a good time to buy a home, so you never know. We\u2019re hopeful - we\u2019re going into the quarter with the highest pipeline - $44 billion - that we\u2019ve had in a couple years, so we\u2019re well positioned and we\u2019ll have to see what the numbers show, but we\u2019re running on faith here. Joe Morford : Sounds good. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, can you hear me? John Stumpf : Yeah, hi Mike. Good morning. Mike Mayo : Hey. Can you talk a little bit more in the housing backlog? How does it look by region, and what are the areas of strength? John Shrewsberry : It\u2019s hard to say. It would be--the mortgage business that we\u2019re looking at right now, we\u2019re talking about national statistics. I guess obviously when we\u2019re talking about affordability and particularly for first-time home buyers or people who are most likely to benefit from the easing of the credit box that John just referred to, they probably would have the hardest time in the hottest markets, which - no surprise - are coastal markets and big cities, sitting here in San Francisco and many of you in New York. So things are more affordable in the middle of the country. That wouldn\u2019t come as any surprise. Most of what we\u2019re referring to is the national pipeline and statistics, and as far as I can tell, the production is pretty balanced from our various mortgage offices. John Stumpf : Mike, just a couple things that you probably already know, as John mentioned, there are certain markets where the biggest challenge for housing is lack of inventory. Still, the entire Bay Area is a bid market where you bid for houses, you--I mean, my daughter and son-in-law bought a house recently. You have to write a letter and tell them how nice you are and how many children you have. A nice letter plus a lot of money will get you in the bidding process. That\u2019s not true, of course, everywhere, but I was in Miami recently and that market, it\u2019s stunning how that market is really doing so well. You would have looked back six years ago and you couldn\u2019t imagine what\u2019s going on today. So it just depends, and it\u2019s a bit about what\u2019s happening in those local economies. In the Bay Area, of course, what\u2019s happening in migration technology and so forth has really created a lot of activity here. So it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag, but all in all, we\u2019re optimistic about the second quarter here. Mike Mayo : Right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Miller : Yes, thank you very much. You talk very positively about your mobile banking, your online banking, which I think everybody is having that same trend, but I know you\u2019ve opened a couple express branches, or whatever you want to call them, in the Washington DC area. How are they working out? Are you planning to expand those types of branches? John Stumpf : Yes, we have--the first one there was NoMa - north of Massachusetts, and we had a second. Now we\u2019re doing a couple others in other markets, but I don\u2019t want to suggest for a minute that you\u2019ll see 6,200 NoMa\u2019s with 1,000 square feet across the franchise. I think it\u2019s a bit of everything, meaning that there is some hub and spoke where you have a larger established branch or store that\u2019s been there for many years, and then you have others around that maybe wouldn\u2019t be as large. You have some like the case in north of Massachusetts where you couldn\u2019t get 5,000 square feet, and 1,000 square feet is optimal for that market. So this is really about looking at our distribution, and what we call actually health of your distribution - are you in the right location with the right hours, the right people, the right footprint, and does the store or the branch work in concert with all the other channels of distribution so customers can start transactions one place, finish another place. Is there ubiquity, is there one version of the truth around information, and how customers serve themselves or want service from us. So it\u2019s a whole bunch of things that really matter in this, and I think the proof in the pudding is our ability to grow primary checking accounts. I\u2019ve never seen growth of 5.7%, and like John mentioned, it\u2019s not that we overpay on deposits - 9 basis points. I mean, this is the magic of how this thing all works together. Paul Miller : And also over by NoMa, you also opened up one in a Safeway--I think it was a Safeway out there. I know a lot of people are moving away from supermarket banking. I don\u2019t think you are a big player in that area, but is that working out also? John Stumpf : Yeah, at one time--this goes back a number of years. In 1998 when the former Norwest, the side of the family I came from, and Wells merged, Wells was hugely indexed - over-indexed to grocery stores. We\u2019ve been adjusting that since that time, but again we think of it density within a market, and sometimes to fill out that density it\u2019s a freestanding ATM machine, sometimes it\u2019s in-store, sometimes it\u2019s a NoMa 1,000 square foot, so it all fits into what we call the S-curve. Maybe I\u2019ll just digress for a second. If a community has, let\u2019s say, 500 banking locations, that\u2019s optimal for a community, and you have 20% of those - 100, and that\u2019s the optimal amount, you\u2019ll actually get more than 20% of the business. You\u2019ll get 25% of the business because certain competitors will have 10% of the stores and they\u2019ll get 8% of the business. So there is a magic to the density and where the density is and how it works together, and that\u2019s just part of our learnings after many, many years. So sometimes grocery stores fit into that, sometimes they don\u2019t. It surely would not be a lead-only strategy, but as an augment, it\u2019s very powerful. Paul Miller : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning, guys. How are you? John Stumpf : Nancy, hi. Nancy Bush : I have a question for you, John S - Stumpf. John Stumpf : Yeah, there\u2019s two John S\u2019s around here! Nancy Bush : John S. doesn\u2019t go anymore. There have been several articles recently, one a couple of days ago, I think maybe in the Wall Street Journal or somewhere, about the changing risk profile at Wells Fargo. They look at increased percentage of revenues coming from investment banking and assign a risk premium to that. Could you just address the whole issue, and just frame out for us how big you want investment banking and/or capital markets activities to be there? John Stumpf : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. We think of customers--and Nancy, I\u2019ll get to the specific question, but the way we think about business here is around relationships, relationships with team members. My 11 direct reports have 28 years with the company. We think of relationships with our customers, our communities, our shareholders. Buffett\u2019s been an owner of ours for 25 years. We love long-term things, so as it gets to investment banking activities, we think of that as another solution, another product, another service. Most of the revenue that comes from that business is from existing customers who have been doing business for a long, long time. When you are the number one middle market bank, when you have leadership positions in energy and ag and commercial real estate, and you do business with 80-plus or 90% of the Fortune 500, you\u2019re going to get opportunities to serve customers deeply and broadly. If that means that through our skills and our people and our value proposition that customers, corporate customers want us to help them with valuation, issuing debt, issuing equity - wonderful. If we\u2019re not good enough to get that and they go someplace else, we just have to work harder. So I don\u2019t really look at lead tables. I guess I read where--in fact, I read for the first time when I read the Journal that we were number seven or eight or nine - I can\u2019t remember the number it was. I could have cared less, absolutely cared less. I only care that we do the right thing for customers, and if that means that we\u2019re moving up - terrific. If that means that others are growing faster because they\u2019re taking risks or doing things that don\u2019t make sense to us, God bless them. So that\u2019s how we think about it, not as a standalone business, as one more way to help customers succeed. Nancy Bush : So I guess that\u2019s sort of it may or may not grow. John Stumpf : Exactly. Just based on our skills and the market availability. John Shrewsberry : Nancy, a couple of data points I\u2019d give you, just to help you dimension it. If you look at Wells Fargo compared to the peer group on the risks that we run, that we report in our 10-Qs and 10-K, we\u2019ve got a more modest set of trading businesses with a very low risk profile, at least as measured by VAR, which is the popular public version of that. Our investment banking fees, while we\u2019re thrilled and happy to have them, amount to a couple billion dollars a year, something like that, on a $90 billion revenue base. I think this quarter we were in the $420 million, $430 million range for trading revenue, which is appropriate for the needs that we have, for customer accommodation, and for managing our own risks. But still, in the scheme of a $1.7 trillion balance sheet, the equity that we carry, and $90 billion worth of revenue, it\u2019s just another one of or a couple of the 90-plus businesses that we refer to, and it\u2019s not imagined to grow in an outsized way from where it is today. We\u2019re always trying to do more, serve customers better. We have great people, but if we--imagine we doubled the size of the business over some period of time while the firm grew at it steady organic rate. We\u2019d still be in a relatively modest percentage of the overall firm. John Stumpf : And Nancy, the risk really would be if you ever saw where the market is shrinking, let\u2019s say in investment banking or capital markets, and we\u2019re outsized growing because we\u2019re taking on risks with customer relationships that we had not known, that\u2019s where you see the imbalance. That\u2019s, again, just not who we are. Nancy Bush : Okay. Second question for John No. 2, in mortgage banking, if you could just repeat what you said about gain on sale. I was writing as fast as I could, but I missed the number. And where do you expect it to be in the second quarter? John Shrewsberry : Yes, so the first quarter was at about 2%, a little more - 2.06%, which is the high end of the five-quarter range, and the second quarter is operating in that neighborhood, so we feel like we\u2019re going to be at the high end of the range in the second quarter as well. John Stumpf : There\u2019s a lot more discipline this time around, Nancy, with gain on sale margins, as you well know because you\u2019ve seen this industry over a long time, so--and that\u2019s a healthy thing. Nancy Bush : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Morning. Just a follow-up on the mortgage competitive landscape here. It\u2019s interesting - we saw JP Morgan out earlier today with a big increase in correspondent originations versus a year ago. I think maybe you\u2019ve been a little more consistent in that business, so it\u2019s just some ebbs and flows. If you could just remind us on the correspondent and maybe talk about the mix that you\u2019re going after right now. John Shrewsberry : Yeah, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a mix of going after as much as a mix of what\u2019s coming in. We\u2019ve been very consistent, as you said. What happens when rates pop down and refis spike up is that our own servicing portfolio results in a lot more applications because the easiest thing for somebody to do when they want to take advantage of a rate rally is call Wells Fargo, because we probably already have their mortgage. So that\u2019s going to have a bigger influence on a strategy that we might have around correspondent, and I think you can see in the supplement that retail was $28 billion and correspondent $20 billion of this quarter\u2019s activity. That\u2019s not an inconsistent blend versus the last several quarters. There are more correspondents these days, as you know, that go direct to the agencies because the agencies have opened the window to them, and that\u2019s also a lower margin business for us, so all things being equal, we\u2019re happy to be a retail lender but we do serve a big correspondent constituency. John Stumpf : And Matt, if you go back in time, we actually had a larger share of the correspondent because there was a number of competitors who backed away, walked away from that market, who come and go from time to time. So that will ebb and flow as participants either stay in or get out, or whatever. Matt O\u2019Connor: Then to circle back on expenses, I guess I\u2019m focused on, call it the people cost - the salaries, commissions, incentive comp, employee benefits. If you sum those three lines, it's up, I think, 6, 7% versus a year ago. I know there\u2019s the trading nuance that we need to adjust for, but is there some impact of the mortgage pipeline impact on those numbers as you staff up in anticipation of higher volume? I\u2019m trying to reconcile why that growth might be so much versus revenue in some of the categories in fees. John Shrewsberry : Yes, I wouldn\u2019t look towards mortgage. I would look towards risk management and investments that we\u2019re making along those lines. The beauty about mortgage in the first quarter was that this refi pipeline helps use the capacity that we would have needed in the fourth quarter and we anticipate needing in the second quarter, so it was a greater level of utilization. For better or for worse, the changes in year-over-year are a variety of other things, including business mix, by the way, in terms of how commissions get paid and other revenue-related incentives. But it would be that plus investments made in compliance and risk management, cyber and information security, things like that. Those are--we have the best people and those are not inexpensive. Matt O\u2019Connor: Any way to size that, either on an absolute basis or versus, say, a year ago, just that overall bucket of, call it non-revenue related cost? John Shrewsberry : I don\u2019t have an accurate number. I think we\u2019ve talked about $100 million a quarter, a couple quarters ago as having been an observable increase in that category, and it\u2019s not any lower than that today. Maybe we\u2019ll see if next time around we can put a finer point on that. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. All right, thank you very much. Operator : Again, that is star, one for any questions. Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. John, just to follow up on your energy-related comments, and I appreciate the detail you provided, but can you just clarify - was there in fact any increase in general or specific reserves for that portfolio or any downward migration in internal risk ratings, or anything of that nature? John Shrewsberry : There was a little bit of downward migration, not enough to meaningfully drive the reserve. There was a little bit of an increase in NPAs, but negligible, and we realized minimal losses in the quarter in the energy portfolio. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. John Shrewsberry : But the change in reserve reflects all of the actual migration, the actual observation of performance in the energy portfolio. Eric Wasserstrom : Understood. One of the other institutions indicated that based on the forward price curve, they would expect some of the pressure on the E&P sector [indiscernible]. John Shrewsberry : I\u2019d have to say yes. I mean, we\u2019re in the middle of our spring redetermination process for the borrowing base loans, so we\u2019ll have a better feeling afterwards. We have noticed a lot of capital raising going on in the space. We talked last quarter about the risk to our investment banking income around energy-related firms, because we\u2019re large in that space, and we had a great first quarter in energy investment banking because lots of equity was raised, lots of firms went to the debt market to turn themselves out. So that\u2019s a very positive sign - there\u2019s people taking steps and changing their balance sheets and improving their risk profile, so that and the combination of where the forward curve demonstrates that energy prices might be going is helpful. But again, that\u2019s reflected in our early view of our allowance and it will be better informed once we finish our borrowing base redeterminations. Eric Wasserstrom : And typically when is that? John Shrewsberry : During this quarter. Eric Wasserstrom : Great, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thank you. I want to drill into the mortgage banking a little bit more, in that when we managed ours and we had this recognition of origination at close and not interest rate locked, whenever prepayments kicked in, servicing income was compressed as you had to write down the servicing for the expected prepayments, but origination income wasn\u2019t at its full run with refi. So in my mind, I was just trying to look at this first quarter as kind of the launching pad going into much stronger, and not to quantify that, but just a stronger return of revenues on mortgage from that timing effect. John Shrewsberry : Actually, I think that\u2019s a pretty astute observation, because we would be valuing the MSR on prepayment expectations, which reflect that lower interest rate, and we haven\u2019t taken the gain on the pipeline and what\u2019s locked and slated to close in the second quarter. Marty Mosby : Two follow-ups to that thought process. Seventy-one basis points on the servicing portfolio has to be close to an all-time low. Are we getting to the point that even with prepayments, we wouldn\u2019t need much more revaluation given you\u2019ve already incorporated a lot of the expected prepayments into the current valuation? John Shrewsberry : It\u2019s a good observation, but it\u2019s tough to say. We look at that calculation regularly, but in connection with our preparation of our financial statements on a quarterly basis, and take everything into account that\u2019s available then, and that\u2019s when we strike the value. Marty Mosby : Then lastly when you convert your unclosed pipeline of $44 billion into what would be a normal pull-through into originations in the next quarter, I get to something like $75 billion to $80 billion. Does that seem about right in the sense that that\u2019s the kind of run rate you\u2019re getting into at this point? John Shrewsberry : Tough to know. We don\u2019t know what hasn\u2019t happened yet, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to--the applications that will be received and pulled through in the quarter, so too early to speculate. Marty Mosby : The good thing is that half of it is already done in the unclosed pipeline, so you at least know that part. John Shrewsberry : That\u2019s right. Marty Mosby : All right, thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Thanks for taking my questions. A quick question on the margin. I wanted to get some color on the 13 basis point decline in commercial loan yields. I know you indicated that was partly impacted by fees. Did lower loan fees account for all of that, or how much of it was downward pressure on yields from pricing pressure? John Shrewsberry : It\u2019s more PCI loan recoveries and lower loan fees than competitive pricing pressure. Those things that we call the variable components of interest income are harder to predict, and when a loan gets resolved that\u2019s been sitting in workout, sometime it comes through the margin line, and then if a loan prepays or there is loan fee hung up in its carrying value, then that sometimes comes through interest income as well. It\u2019s those types of items that are tough to plan for, tough to budget, and in this particular quarter were lower than in prior quarters. John Pancari : Okay, and then how does that play into your margin outlook? Is it fair to assume still mid-single digit basis point compression per quarter as we move through \u201915? John Shrewsberry : It\u2019s too tough to call, because it depends on what happens with deposit growth, it depends on what happens with loan growth, and then other investments that we make in the securities portfolio. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive it. It\u2019s led by what happens to deposit growth, and of course if there were a move in interest rates, that would have an impact as well. We\u2019re not trying to forecast it in this instance. John Pancari : Okay, all right. John Stumpf : Yeah, our real focus is on generating growth in net interest income, and the margin is more the result, not the reason. John Pancari : Right, okay. Then on that front, John, if you could just talk a little bit about loan growth expectations. I know you gave some good color on what you\u2019re seeing on C&I, but CRE, you saw still declines in your total CRE book. I want to get some thoughts around a sustained inflection in that portfolio organically, and then is it also fair to assume that the loan growth overall should remain in the mid-single digit range at this point? John Shrewsberry : Tough to call, because it depends on the mix. We\u2019ve got a variety of commercial and consumer asset types here that each have their own market and cyclical dynamics. I think we expect cards were probably at a seasonal low in the first quarter, so between seasonality and issuing new cards, that business probably grows. Auto, we\u2019ve kept--it\u2019s grown but kept relatively stable. It\u2019s gotten to be a more competitive market, and we\u2019ve picked our spots, I think, a little bit more delicately. In commercial real estate, it\u2019s going to be tough to spot the organic component of it because the purchase of the GE portfolio and this incremental loan to Blackstone Mortgage Trust is going to have a big impact in the second and third quarters. But if I\u2019d add anything to that, it\u2019s that now the competitive dynamic in commercial real estate lending is a little bit different because a big competition is exiting the business. That probably means something for us organically, if that\u2019s helpful. John Pancari : Okay, thank you. My last question is just on the credit side. The oil and gas reserve post what you did this quarter, can you quantify where that reserve stands right now? John Shrewsberry : You know, we don\u2019t call it out specifically. We capture the whole portfolio in our overall allowance for loan losses and feel that that is absolutely adequate for the loan book that we have, which incidentally has never been better overall. Oil and gas loans are approximately 2% of the total portfolio. John Pancari : Right. Okay, thanks again for taking my questions. John Stumpf : Okay, this concludes our call, so thanks. I especially want to thank you to all 265,000 team members for a very, very good first quarter, and thanks for all of you on the line. We will see you next quarter. Bye bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference. Jim Rowe : Thank you, Regina, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter result and answer your questions. This call will be recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings; including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf. John Stumpf : Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. We earned $5.7 billion in the second quarter, as our diversified business model continued to generate strong loan and deposit growth. Our financial strength and competitive position have allowed us to capture opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisitions. In addition, our commitment to managing risk and a benefit of an improving housing market continue to improve our credit results.  Let me highlight our growth this quarter compared with one year ago. We earned $1.03 in earnings per share, up 2% from a year ago. We generated $21.3 billion of revenue, up 1% from a year ago with 4% growth in net interest income. We had broad based loan growth with total loans reaching a record $888.5 billion and our core loan portfolio increased by $68.5 billion or 9%. Our growth benefited from the $11.5 billion GE Capital loan purchasing and financing transaction in the second quarter. Our deposit franchise continue to generate strong customer and balance growth with average deposits up $83.8 billion or 8% while we reduced deposit costs.  We also grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%. Our credit performance continued to improve and our net charge-off rate declined to 30 basis points of average loans, the lowest level in 20 years.  Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation and returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 7% to 37.5 cents per common share and we repurchased 36 million shares of common stock. We\u2019ve reduced our common shares outstanding for five consecutive quarters with shares down 105 million from one year ago. While recent developments in Europe and Asia have implications for the US economy, the ongoing US economic expansion has remained on track and has entered its seventh year, a feat accomplished only four other times in the US history. The labor market continued to recover with a record 57 consecutive months of payroll gains and housing activity has been especially encouraging with second quarter position to be the best quarter performance sales since 2007. These factors, along with an increase in consumer confidence makes me optimistic that the economic expansion will sustain momentum into the second half of the year and Wells Fargo should benefit from the increase in economic activity as we remain focused on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs. John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our second quarter results. John? John Shrewsberry : Thank you, John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. Our results this quarter is straightforward and demonstrate momentum across a variety of key business drivers. We continue to have strong loan and deposit growth across our diversified businesses. We grew net interest income with earning asset growth and our net interest margin improved. Many of our customer-facing businesses generated strong fee growth. Credit quality improved and we had lower net charge-offs and a higher reserve release and we continued to operate within our targeted ranges for ROA, ROE and efficiency. Let me now highlight these key drivers in more detail. On Page 3, we highlight the year-over-year growth John emphasized in his remarks including revenue, loans, deposits and EPS as well as improving credit. Turning to Page 4, we continued to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet which has positioned us well to take advantage of growth opportunities and to prudently deploy liquidity. Short-term investments and FED funds sold were down $59.1 billion from the first quarter reflecting loan growth, security purchases and lower deposit balances driven by seasonality in our consumer businesses and repricing in certain wholesale businesses.  Our securities portfolio grew $16 billion from the first quarter. We purchased approximately $36 billion in securities primarily agency MBS, US treasuries and municipal securities which were partially offset by maturities, amortization and sales. Turning to the income statement on Page 5, it\u2019s important to note that the linked quarter decline in earnings was driven by the $359 million discrete tax benefit recognized in the first quarter. Our pre-tax earnings increased $386 million or 5% from the first quarter, demonstrating the underlying momentum we had across our businesses.  Revenue increased $40 million from first quarter with strong growth in net interest income, up $284 million reflecting growth in earning assets. We had linked quarter growth and fee income in most of our customer-facing businesses including deposit service charges, trust and investment fees, card fees, merchant processing, commercial real estate brokerage, mortgage and insurance.  However, non-interest income declined $244 million from first quarter due to lower market-sensitive revenue and lower other income driven by the accounting impact related to our debt hedges. Expenses declined, despite an increase in operating losses related to litigation accruals and we generated positive operating leverage. As shown on Page 6, we continued to have strong loan growth in the second quarter, our 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $68.5 billion, or 9% from a year ago and was up $29.5 billion from first quarter. Our growth was broad based which I\u2019ll highlight on the next slide and included $11.5 billion from the GE Capital loan purchase and financing transaction. This transaction is an excellent example of how the combination of our balance sheet strengths, the expertise of our team members and our relationship focus positions us to capture opportunities for growth. 67% of this portfolio is US-based with the remainder of the portfolio predominantly in the United Kingdom and Canada, which are active lending markets for us. The loans we purchased were to over 145 different customers while we had existing relationships with many of these customers, the transaction has provided us with a meaningful number of new relationships which we believe will lead to additional opportunities for new business. It\u2019s also important to note that we didn\u2019t acquire these loans until late in the quarter, so while it increased ending loan balances, most of the benefit to average loans and to net interest income will be reflected in the third quarter. On Page 7, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $36.6 billion or 15% from a year ago, the GE Capital transaction drove $4.2 billion of this growth primarily from the financing to Blackstone Mortgage Trust. The rest of the growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double-digit year-over-year growth in asset-backed finance, equipment finance, corporate banking and government and institutional banking.  Commercial real estate loans grew $10.2 billion or 8% from a year ago and included $7.3 billion from the GE Capital transaction. Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $15 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high-quality non-conforming mortgages. Credit card balances were up $3.9 billion or 14% from a year ago, benefiting from strong new account growth and the Dillard\u2019s portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of last year.  Auto loans were up $3.7 billion or 7% from last year. New originations reflected the strong auto market and were up 5% from a year ago and up 15% from first quarter benefiting from seasonality.  As highlighted on Page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $83.8 billion from a year ago and up $10.5 billion from first quarter. Our average deposit cost declined 8 basis points, down 2 basis points from a year ago. The decline in ending balances reflected the seasonal impact to consumer balances due to income tax payments and repricing in certain wholesale businesses primarily global financial institutions.  We continued to successfully grow our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5.6% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5.3%. Our primary customers have more products with us and are more than twice as profitable as non-primary customers.  Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification in the balance between spread and fee income which has shifted slightly to more net-interest income as we benefited from strong earning asset growth. Our earning asset mix results and diversified \u2013 results and diversified sources of interest income, the drivers of our fee generation are also diverse and vary based on interest rate and economic conditions, for example, market-sensitive revenue which includes trading gains from our \u2013 trading and gains from our debt and equity investments declined 21% from first quarter, market-sensitive revenue was 8% of our fee income in the second quarter, down from 11% in the first quarter, however, many of our other customer-facing businesses generated higher fee income.  We grew net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by %524 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in average earning assets, up 11% from a year ago. The $312 million increase in net interest income from first quarter reflected growth in earning assets and one extra day in the quarter. Net interest income also benefited from increased income from variable sources, lower deposit cost and higher income from interest rate swaps used to convert a portion of our floating rate commercial loans to fixed rate as we continue to add duration to our balance sheet.  The net interest margin increased 2 basis points from the first quarter. This is the first linked quarter increase in the NIM since the first quarter of 2012. The increase this quarter was driven by balance sheet repricing and growth including growth in investments and loans and lower deposit cost which benefited the margin by 4 basis points.  Higher variable income from increased loan fees, semi-annual preferred dividends and PCR recoveries contributed 1 basis point to the margin, customer-driven deposit growth reduced the margin by 3 basis points but had minimal impact to net interest income. Our balance sheet remains asset-sensitive and we are positioned to benefit from higher rates. However, we believe we can grow net interest income in 2015, compared with 2014 even if rates remain low.  Total non-interest income declined $244 million from first quarter, driven by lower market-sensitive revenue and lower other non-interest income. The other non-interest income category was down $426 million in the second quarter driven by the accounting impact of interest rate and currency hedges associated with our long-term debt.  We are required to measure the hedge effectiveness quarterly and while the net impact is expected to be zero over the term, quarterly interest rate and currency volatility can cause this line item to vary from quarter-to-quarter. It\u2019s important to note that while total non-interest income declined, if you exclude market-sensitive revenue and other income, we had strong diversified fee growth across our other fee categories demonstrating growth from doing more business with our customers.  In fact, second quarter was the strongest quarter over the past five quarters for brokerage, trust and investment management, card, merchant processing, insurance and mortgage origination. Mortgage banking revenue increased up $158 million from the first quarter on higher origination volume, up $13 billion or 27%.  Second quarter had the highest level of mortgage production since the third quarter of 2013, 54% of originations before purchases up 45% in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a $38 billion application pipeline, up $8 billion from a year ago and down $6 billion from first quarter. Based on the current rate environment, the level of our pipeline and the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, we currently expect originations in the third quarter to be lower than the second quarter. Our gain on sale ratio was 188 basis points in the second quarter and we currently expect the third quarter ratio to remain within the range of the past five quarters between 140 and 210 basis points.  As shown on Page 12, expenses were down $38 million from the first quarter, the decline was primarily due to lower employee benefits expense which was seasonally elevated in the first quarter. Operating losses were $521 million in the second quarter, up $226 million from the first quarter reflecting higher litigation accruals for various legal matters. While we continue to invest in our businesses reflected in higher professional services and advertising expenses in the second quarter, we remained focused on operating efficiently as indicated by our efficiency ratio improving to 58.5%. We expect the efficiency ratio for the full year 2015 to remain within our targeted range of 55% to 59%. Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.4 billion in the second quarter, down 8% from first quarter which included the discrete tax benefit. One of the drivers of our long-term growth is our ability to grow retail bank households. Year-to-date through May, we\u2019ve had the strongest household growth in four years. This strong growth reflects our success in attracting new customers to Wells Fargo as well as the benefit of better retention of our existing households as we remain focused on meeting their financial needs. This focus has also resulted in an increase in total products held by our customers. For example, we\u2019ve been successfully growing the penetration rate of credit cards to our retail bank households which has grown to 42.6% in the second quarter, up from 39% a year ago and 34.9% two years ago. Credit card purchase volume was up 15% from a year ago reflecting an increase in new accounts; debit card purchase volume was up 8% from a year ago benefiting from the strong growth in primary checking account customers and increased usage among existing customers.  Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the second quarter, up 3% from a year ago and 12% from first quarter. Wholesale banking continued to have strong loan and deposit growth. Average loans grew 12% from a year ago with broad based growth across most wholesale businesses.  This growth in average loans did not fully reflect the benefit of the GE Capital transaction reported late in the quarter. Average core deposits grew 14% from a year ago and flat linked quarter reflecting pricing actions we took in the second quarter to reduce deposit costs.  The strong loan and deposit growth helps grow revenue by 2% from a year ago. Treasury and management revenue grew 10% reflecting new product sales and repricing. Second quarter revenue also benefited from higher equity gains from the sale of certain equity fund investments driven by the Volcker Rule.  Wells Brokerage and Retirement had another record quarter earning $602 million in the second quarter, up 11% from a year ago and up 7% from first quarter. WBR\u2019s pre-tax margin was 26% in the second quarter exceeding its long-term target of 25%. Revenue grew 5% from a year ago, driven by higher recurring sources of revenue. Net interest income increased 12% and asset-based fees were up 7%. Brokerage advisory assets grew $434 billion, up $25 billion or 6% from a year ago, primarily driven by net flows.  WBR\u2019s strong loan growth continued with eight consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth. Loan growth accelerated this quarter up 16% from a year ago, the strongest growth rate in over six years. Growth was broad based with strong client demand across a number of product offerings.  Turning to Page 16, credit quality in the second quarter improved. Our net charge-off rate declined to 30 basis points of average loans. Non-performing assets have declined for 11 consecutive quarters and were down $438 million from first quarter. Non-accrual loans declined $67 million from first quarter as higher energy non-accrual loans were offset by improvement in residential real estate as well as other categories.  The reserve release was $350 million in the second quarter. The increase from first quarter was driven by continued credit quality improvement, most notably, significant improvement in residential real estate. Our credit losses in our residential real estate portfolios declined 22% and non-accrual loans declined $388 million or 4% from first quarter. It\u2019s important to note that even small changes in the performance of our residential real estate portfolios tend to out way changes in other portfolios, given the size of our residential real estate portfolio was 36% of total loans.  We had an increase in non-performing loans in our energy portfolio. Oil and gas loans are only 2% of our total loan portfolio and balances in this portfolio declined by approximately $700 million from first quarter reflecting pay downs.  Our energy team completed their spring re-determination process during the second quarter and as expected, the drop in energy prices did impact the cash flow and collateral values of a number of our borrowers leading to downward portfolio migration. The deterioration in this portfolio is reflected in our allowance for credit losses and we will continue to monitor the energy portfolio. Finally when considering our allowance, it\u2019s important to note that the loans we acquired from GE Capital were accounted for under purchase accounting under GAAP and reflected a lifetime credit loss adjustment and therefore did not require additional loan loss reserves typically associated with commercial loan growth.  Turning to Page 17, our capital levels remains strong with our estimated common equity tier-1 ratio under Basel-3 fully phased in at 10.5% in the second quarter. We returned $2.9 billion to shareholders in the second quarter through dividends and net share repurchases. Our common shares outstanding declined by 17.7 million shares in the second quarter reflecting 36.3 million shares repurchased and 18.6 million shares issued. We expect to reduce our common shares outstanding through share repurchases throughout the remainder of the year. Our dividend payout ratio increased to 36% in the second quarter, as we increased the quarterly dividend rate on our common stock by 7%.  Our net payout ratio in the second quarter was 54%. The decline in our net payout ratio reflected our strong asset and RWA growth as our first call for capital is for providing credit to our customers. However we remained committed to returning capital to our shareholders and we expect our net payout ratio to be within our targeted range of 55% to 75% for the full year. In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong loan and deposit growth and momentum in non-interest income across many of our customer-facing businesses. Our strong liquidity position and capital levels position us well to serve our existing customers while growing our customer base organically and through acquisition.  The improvement in credit quality demonstrated our continued focus on risk management. While the current interest rate environment remains uncertain, we are actively managing our expenses while focusing on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs to generate growth.  We will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. John Stumpf : Good morning. Ken Usdin : John, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more on your confidence about the economic environment versus the commentary about the competition out there. So we know you guys are going to get a great benefit looking ahead from the averaging of the GE. So on one, could you just kind of flush out the pockets of loan growth that you continue to expect and then also, do you anticipate being able to at least be in a pole position to get some more of those GE assets? Thanks. John Stumpf : So, there are variety of loan categories that deserves to be mentioned individually, but you know we are aggressively growing the card business with our existing deposit customers and percentage gains there will probably continue to be very strong. Autos in spite of the heat in that market and our public posture of wanting to maintain our credit discipline still are providing a big opportunity because so many cars are being sold. So and that\u2019s a continued opportunity. Still a lot going on in commercial real estate and as you mentioned the GE Capital loans helped us late in the third quarter there. Jumbo loans on the residential side have been growing on the balance sheet at the same strong pace for a long time and we continue to \u2013 we expect to see that there. Across the C&I range, we mentioned several of the businesses that have slightly independent but all attractive growth prospects. The utilization of lines across the variety of corporate and commercial loan categories is still in the, call it mid to low 30s. So there is room for that improvement and we keep gathering new customers in those businesses as well. So, it\u2019s really is coming from everywhere at attractive basis. John Shrewsberry : Yes, Ken, there is a fair amount of capacity to carry more debt by medium size companies, small companies and consumers. Rates are very favorable and most Americans businesses and consumers have de-risked and deleveraged their balance sheet. So there are opportunities and we are very active on main street and on the back 40 working with the customers. So, we love this opportunity to do the GE thing, but organic relative still the main part the way we grow. John Stumpf : And with respect what there still might be to do with GE, there have been some portfolio sales that have been announced there since the one that we worked on. We are working as closely as we can with them. They are a great relationship of ours. There are our businesses that they are trying to dispose of that fit neatly with our expertise. Some things were going to be very competitive with and some because we are not expert in them will be less so. But we are working hard. We hope that that turns incremental opportunity to do more of what we\u2019ve done on the commercial real estate side and we\u2019ll be hearing about that in the coming months as their processes unfold. Ken Usdin : Okay, great. And I have \u2013 just to follow-up on the energy portfolio shrinkage, you spoke about the $700 million decline, I am sure that we\u2019ll have the questions about the NPA growth. Could you talk about just what you are seeing in the energy side? Is that active? Like push outs by you guys, is it the equitization coming in and taking out credits? Can you just talk about like how that portfolio behavior is acting and how that influences your provisioning decisions? John Stumpf : Sure, so, I would describe the reduction in the principal balance as borrowers taking their balances down and just to conform with their borrowing base reductions and as I mentioned that was about $700 million of reduction in the second quarter. There was a lot of capital being raised in the first quarter; capital markets activity was very brisk in the first quarter. A little bit slower in the second quarter and a lot of that was equity coming in to stabilize balance sheets. It feels like that slow down just a little bit as people process what happened in the first quarter. So we don\u2019t anticipate loan balances or new loan activity to be terribly brisk in terms of leading to higher outstandings at Wells Fargo in the second half of the year. But the market is acting very rationally. The market is acting very quickly. The opportunists are arriving at the door and trying to work things out, create business combinations and take advantage of the situation to resolve it. So, things are happening frankly a little bit faster than we might have anticipated sitting here six or eight months ago. Ken Usdin : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Morford : Good morning everyone. John Stumpf : Hello, Joe. John Shrewsberry : Hey, Joe. Joe Morford : I guess just a follow-up on the credit trends within the energy portfolio. With the borrowing base re-determinations finalized, I mean, you touched on this, but how is performance tracked relative to initial expectations and how much of the increase in the related non-performing loans stems from that as opposed to the shared national credit exam? John Stumpf : Well, it\u2019s a combination of both and it\u2019s tough to call out specifically what the regulators might have independently wanted that we wouldn\u2019t have agreed to or gotten to on our own. I mean, the outcome is what it is and if we had about a $400 million increase to non-performing assets in energy for the quarter, which feels like it makes sense. And to the extent that some of those were very conservative estimations of NPA status I think and that will be recaptured in the back-end of the process when those loans get worked out which is fine. We had very nominal losses in the quarter and we\u2019ll go into a fall re-determination for E&P companies as well and we\u2019ll measure the performance of the midstream and services companies at the same time. We feel great about where our allowance is right now as you may recall they had an impact on our first quarter number even though that was pre re-determination and has an impact again on the second quarter number and who knows as the third and fourth quarter roll through, I am sure that there will be more loans that are at issue. The whole portfolio amounts to 2% of our loan portfolio, we feel very well reserved for where we are. We\u2019ve got the best team in energy banking and our credit folks working through the portfolio. So, it\u2019s - the impact here is relatively immaterial to Wells Fargo. And we as we called out in our comment, especially in a quarter like Q2, minor changes in our residential real estate portfolio have a tendency to dwarf whatever is going on in energy because 36% of the loan portfolio is in single-family real estate and 2% is in energy. John Shrewsberry : Joe, I would offer this, since I\u2019ve been on a long time, I think this is my third or fourth cycle I remember doing workouts in this business in the early 80s. This one is different in that \u2013 the energy participants whether they be on the E&P side or midstream, whatever it is, I am more conservative. They tend to be better capitalized, be rapid, more quickly through reducing their CapEx budgets, some case reducing dividends and some of the real stretchy stuff was done outside of our industry if you will. So, that mean that all situations are going to workout, but, they wouldn\u2019t \u2013 and reacted much more quickly than I have seen in the past cycles. Joe Morford : That\u2019s very helpful. Big color. I guess, have you quantified what you have in terms of dedicated reserves against the energy portfolio and as you point out, given that, things like single-family is such a bigger part of the overall loan portfolio and what\u2019s your broader outlook for the provision and the possibility of any future reserve releases? John Stumpf : So, we are bumping along here at 30 basis points of annualized net losses on the total loan portfolio and as we called out in the past, we shouldn\u2019t expect releases in any given quarter because it\u2019s going to \u2013 the calculation heats quarter of the allowance is going to include the observed portfolio of the portfolio is going to include general economic conditions is going to include where the growth is coming from in the mix in the portfolio. So, I would not model in release of this magnitude going forward and of course, as we\u2019ve said, we keep building our loan portfolio, you\u2019d expect to see builds often \u2013 things being equal. Separately, we also called out in the case of GE, if we are growing our loan portfolio by acquiring loans, and we invoke purchase accounting, then that\u2019s a complicating factor and whether the allowance is growing or not because the mark on the loans reflects the lifetime credit adjustment. So that\u2019s a little complicated. But \u2013 so, and for our own internal purposes, of course there is an allocable component of the allowance that reflects what we think a loss \u2013 the inherent loss content is in the energy portfolio and that will grow or shrink depending on how the portfolio performs. And as I said, I would assume that the next couple of quarters how much better than the last quarter in terms of we are still resolving these issues, some of them are just coming to life for certain borrowers but it\u2019s a very contained portion of our loan portfolio and the aggregate impact should not be material for Wells Fargo. Joe Morford : Understand. Thanks so much. John Stumpf : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. John Shrewsberry : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Just wanted to take a step back, as we enter potentially a rising rate environment in the second half of the year fingers crossed, one of your peers they meant, mentioned, anticipating a significantly more competitive environment for retail deposits given the regulators have essentially said, there are good deposits and bad deposits this time around. And secondarily, they also mentioned entering new markets for the first time and de novoing. I guess, the first question is, how should we expect Wells Fargo\u2019s repricing to progress actually rise on the short-end, secondarily, given the impressive footprint that you\u2019ve built, how would you defend that market sharing footprint against those that are aggressively trying to grow retail deposits, particularly for regulatory purposes? John Shrewsberry : Erika, let me start with that. It\u2019s a great question and not all retail deposits are credit equal. You know our focus here has been on relationships and we think relationships on the consumer side start with a consumer checking account. In fact, I don\u2019t have this exactly but I think it\u2019s 86% of our retail customers have a checking account with us it\u2019s their primary account they live out of that. And if you look at certificates and deposit, it\u2019s less than $35 billion here. So it\u2019s a couple percent of ours. So that\u2019s a very different deposit make up and like other companies in our industry, we had a lot of experience in rates backing up. And the speed of the backup matters where it starts from, a move from 300% to 400% is different from a move from nothing to 1%. And also where you employ those more expensive deposits, will you find offsetting earning assets to employ those. And, I recall the last time we went through this, we had very aggressive deposit competitors who are using those deposits to fund businesses acquired to sell models in the real estate business for example. So it was used. So, we\u2019ve been through a lot of different things. We\u2019ve modeled this. If I were a bettering person, I would bet that we\u2019ll probably be favorable to our model suggest early in the backup, but I think one of the great under valued parts of our business today is the quality of our deposit franchise and you\u2019ll see that in the backup. John Stumpf : And to the point of entering new markets, well, we adjust our store footprint meaningfully every year by opening and closing stores where we see fit, I think as Carrie Tolstedt has described in our last Investor Day, we believe that we need a certain amount of scale in any urban market before we can really make a difference and we are in most of the markets that we like to be in, and of course we are not going to get there through acquisitions. So, it would seem unusual for us to commit to building, for example, hundreds and hundreds of stores in a new major urban center that we are not already a part of. So, I wouldn\u2019t think about that as part of our next stage plan. Erika Najarian : Got it and just a follow-up on some of the comments, John, thank you for telling us how you accounted for the GE purchase. How should we think about your capital progress relative to further, or incremental loan purchases? As I think about the past three quarters your CET1 ratio has been fairly stable at about 10.5%. If you are using purchase accounting for larger loan purchases, of course that would impact CET1 and I guess I'm wondering sort of what your thoughts on the \u2013 you know whether you may account for purchases differently going forward, as you consider the CET1 progress particularly in light - in terms of some commentary, you've heard from regulators recently about including CET1 surcharges in the CCAR test? John Stumpf : Sure, well, so the first call on our capital is for our customers, including prospective customers if we were going to add either an originator or acquirer portfolios of loans. I don\u2019t think there is any accounting theory out there that would allow us to add loans without impacting common equity tier-1. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s risk-weighted assets are what is for. So if we had a bigger opportunity to grow RWA faster and the way that we thought was very attractive for shareholders, then we would probably do that and if we need to do, for example, curtail distributions and for some period of time in order to retain the capital to create that outcome, then we would probably do that. As we\u2019ve told people in our capital planning process and describing it, we want to keep as much capital as it\u2019s appropriate and necessary to grow the business and that\u2019s primarily by growing RWA and we want to distribute everything beyond that and which is about where we\u2019ve been operating. So if there were a bigger RWA opportunity, we would measure where we were starting from, we would understand what sort of capital generation was going on at that time and it\u2019s possible, we would end up retaining a little bit more in order to maintain satisfactory levels while growing assets. Erika Najarian : Got it. So I am clear on the takeaway. Any portfolio purchases from has to be life of loan accounting in terms of the losses? John Stumpf : Yes. Erika Najarian : Okay. And just a quick follow-up to the GE portfolio, you did add this quarter you mentioned that we need to consider the average balance impact. Are there any considerations on the average yield impact, as we think about the third quarter? John Stumpf : For average yield of the loan portfolio? Erika Najarian : Yes, in terms of\u2026 John Stumpf : Yes, the GE loans fit right into the averages that we already had. So it\u2019s really more balanced. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on margins. Part of the NIM compression that we have been seeing for so long has obviously been in part due to all the excess liquidity that's been getting parked at the FED as deposit growth has significantly outpaced loan growth really at a system-wide level. But today, we saw one of your competitors reported a decrease in deposits both sequentially and year-over-year while still putting up pretty solid loan growth, and you guys also saw your loan growth outpaced your deposit growth this quarter. So, I guess the question is, do you think we're at an inflection point where we'll no longer see deposit growth continue to exceed loan growth and if so, does that suggest that that we should begin to see some continued improvement in NIMs going forward? John Stumpf : Let me take the deposit side first and then John can do that. If you \u2013 one quarter does not make summer as one sparrow if you will, if you look at the last year, we grew average deposits b y almost $84 billion and our core loan portfolio grew $60 some billion, if you take our overall loan portfolio, it was in the $40 billion to $50 billion. So we actually outgrew deposits by some $20 billion or $30 billion on an annual basis. The first quarter is always kind of a funny quarter when you compare to the second quarter or second quarter to the first quarter because of the tax impact, because we have such a large retail deposit base. So, we look back, I think to 1945, I think all but one year, we grew deposit. So, whether we can outgrow or not outgrow, we sure like our opportunities continuing on the deposit side, because after all we are growing net new consumer checking accounts primary by 5.6% and on small business we are growing by 5.3% or 4%. These are the strongest numbers I\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years in my history at the company. So these are very, very strong acquisition numbers. John Shrewsberry : So, one thing I have to mention about the industry and I am sure you are thinking about this. But, we are in a slightly different position but there are some other larger banks that are discouraging deposits because of the adverse impact on leverage ratio, the adverse impact on the GSIB buffer calculations, et cetera and people have been vocal about getting out there and trying to move those deposits out of their banks to take their numbers down and those are in the same deposit numbers that you are referring to. So, it\u2019s a little bit complicated I think, bank-by-bank as you are looking at it. Ours is as John described. And we are also not shrinking our store count and we have found that, in our omni channel distribution, where you have stores or locations ATMs, phones, online and mobile, it\u2019s the magic of all those working together. And that\u2019s a very strong compelling value proposition for our customers. John Stumpf : At both attracting retaining deposits and then back to Erika\u2019s question about what happens in a backup, people who want to move away from Wells Fargo are moving away from that value proposition that\u2019s provided to them basically for free in exchange for having their relationship at Wells Fargo. Bill Carcache : Thank you. If I may, as a follow-up, the amount of liquidity that you are holding at the said FED, you mentioned fell this quarter from an all-time high of $291 billion, I believe last quarter. Is it reasonable to expect that to continue to fall from here as you redeploy more of that into higher-yielding loans and securities? And taking LCR into consideration and the constraints there, can you give us a sense for where we could see those balances go? John Shrewsberry : Well, it depends on what\u2019s happening on other fronts including ongoing deposit growth. But, I wouldn\u2019t forecast it as coming down, but as we\u2019ve described before, there is probably tens of billions of dollars of room from where we are today to where that balance might go before we started to having any difficult discussions about LCR. So there is plenty of room from where we are today. Bill Carcache : Okay, thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Miller : Yes, thank you very much. Talking a bit about the mortgage side, when we saw rates go up, but I think a lot of \u2013 when the volumes have held in very strong, some of that I think is the \u2013 as the refi pipeline coming out of first quarter, but - can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the purchase market world? Is it really starting to make a comeback? John Shrewsberry : So, yes, it was a strong quarter and I mean, strongest in a while, it doesn\u2019t reflect the pre-crisis types of activity at this point. It\u2019s strong in a handful of individual markets, California, New York, Southern Florida, Denver or particular markets where we\u2019ve seen a lot of strength. First time home buyers are a little bit stronger at about 30% of home purchases. We saw that our purchases as a percentage of originations were 54% this quarter versus 45 the prior quarter as you mentioned, the second quarter had a lot of refis closing in it that were locked in the first quarter when rates were very low. So, when we think about new application volume in the second quarter, my guess is, as that flows through in Q3 that number will be even higher. All things being equal, because rates did backup meaningfully in the quarter. So, the business is good. There is plenty of credit available. We are obviously as enthusiastic and committed to it as we\u2019ve ever been. Margins have been holding in there nicely and the pipeline looks quite good actually. Paul Miller : And then, go ahead. John Shrewsberry : One last thing I\u2019d add is that, all of that is a reflection of continued affordability while home prices have moved, there is still affordable, while rates have moved they are still affordable. So, that\u2019s helping a lot and we\u2019ve had an improving jobs market which brings more people into eligibility for a purchase or a refinancing. Paul Miller : And then you saw the \u2013 I mean, everybody saw the [Indiscernible] has been pushed back another three months. Do you see any impact on the mortgage market or on how you view the mortgage market with the new regulations with [Indiscernible] John Shrewsberry : No, except - one thing I would say is we were ready to go with the original deadline. But, no impact. Paul Miller : Okay. Thank you very much gentlemen. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, thank you. Just a question, John, on the efficiency ratio. You\u2019re at the high end of your range last couple of quarters. Do you see opportunities to drive down the efficiency ratio prior to rates going up or is it more likely to stay still at the upper-end of the range until we see interest rates move higher? John Shrewsberry : I think it's going to stay in the upper part of the range until revenue moves higher, which will probably happen as a result of - or at least most meaningfully over a short period of time because of rates moving higher. We are spending the money that we think we need to spend to run a great business today and manage risk, as well as invest in the future around things that customers want, things that we need to be a well run, resilient, compliant, risk managed, technologically savvy firm, and that gets us to 58 plus or minus percent, which I would remind you is a very good number for a bank of our size. But, yes, there is no near-term path or project to try and drive ourselves down in the range. We are trying to operate where we have been, accomplish all the things that we need to accomplish and deal with the reality that we are in a below 3% GDP growth environment, in a zero rate environment, neither of which is as hospitable as some other environments might be for revenue growth in banking. John Stumpf : And, John the \u2013 but we're always, as you know us and you know us well, we continue to look for opportunities to simplify the business, streamline the work we do so we can repurpose those dollars into things that are important to customers, important to risk management, other things here. So the development that we are doing and image capture in our branches or our stores, the different things that we invest in payments, cyber and all the other things that we do, we are self-funding through being very thoughtful about where we spend our money. John McDonald : Thank you. And one other question, guys, could you comment on the market and what it's like for additional portfolio purchases? I assume it's very competitive, obviously, GE has got some other assets out for sale. And just in general, nothing specific but more general, what are the pros and cons when you look at portfolios to purchase and kind of how do you feel like the markets like for that? John Shrewsberry : So, it's very competitive, and I think that this current set of assets that's being offered for sale is being viewed by some people as the biggest opportunity in a long time. Some of the assets or platforms are suitable for non-depository institutions and I would say that non-banks interested in creating a lending platform would appear to be willing to pay a bigger premium than people who have an existing platform and are looking to add customers and assets to it. All of these do require financing in one form or another. So that can be either a limiting factor or for the easier to finance assets, I guess, that can be a benefit for people who don't have deposit bases in order to bid. But very competitive, it\u2019s how I would describe it. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Questions, one on other income and one on the wealth business. You called out on other income that you had a $426 million impact from the debt hedges. I just wanted to make sure I understood what that was driven by - I know you indicated rate moves. Just want to make sure I understand is that the long-end of the curve. And does it have any relation to the fair value hedges that you put in the 10-Q, the $173 million. So, wanted to make sure understand how that works. John Shrewsberry : Sure, so for some of the debt that we issue, we swap it back to dollars and swap it back to LIBOR and so we've got perfect cash flow hedges on where we choose to do that. The accounting for that requires the liability on the one hand and the hedge on the other to be discounted using different discount rates and so over the life of both instruments, there can be some noise in the P&L. We've had a benefit in the past and this time we had a negative and it was driven by a few things, but mostly by the major movements in longer-term swap rates in dollar, Sterling and LIBOR during the quarter. And the net impact from the quarter is, as it was described in the materials. So I\u2019d just point out, this is sort of a \u2013 call that\u2019s a timing difference, an accounting difference, it nets back to zero over the life of the liability. So we don't think of it as a real economic issue, but it creates noise in the other non-interest income line item. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So the net was $426 million, not the $426 million plus the $173 million from the fair value hedges in the 10-Q? John Shrewsberry : Correct. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Okay, separately on wealth. I've been just reading some articles recently that talked about how - and you can tell me this is correct or not, but how the focus is not really on increasing the number of FAs and obviously we see flat FAs in the release you put out today, but more on the technology and the investment spend there. Is that accurate, number one and number two, could you explain how you are looking to advance the technology platforms that you got in this business? John Shrewsberry : Sure. So, I wouldn't say that it's an express strategy to not increase the number of FAs. I don't think that that's necessarily the primary driver of value creation in the long-term for David Carroll's business. You may see that differently, John. The point on technology is a good one. There are a number of initiatives underway in that business to modernize and to create service capability to attract new investors and to better serve the investors that we have. And that turns up in the \u2013 sort of primary systems that our financial advisors use to interact with our customers. It will turn up in our mobile and online offerings that allow people to do more for themselves and at some point, it could even include service or capability that competes with some of the sort of the robo advisory people out there today who rely primarily on technology to construct portfolios and make offerings to customers. All of those things are opportunities for us to make the business even stronger and more relevant going forward on top of what we feel is very good performance over the last few years. John Stumpf : Yes, and Betsy we see this really is one of the most attractive growth opportunities in the company. If you think of how we are positioned as a broadly diversified company serving customers, one in three Americans, one way or another, Americans are living longer. They are probably convinced you have to be more reliant on their own resources for the retirement. And we have 10% to 11% of the deposits in the country and yet, only a fraction of that as far as where we manage well. So this is a big opportunity and investments in people and systems and capabilities, but that should in no way, the growth -- we've already done great work. David Carroll and his team have done incredible. I mean, think how many companies out there would love to have the way we monetize and the way everybody else does $602 million of after-tax earnings for a quarter, 26% margins, these are very, very good numbers. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, a factual question. What was the amount of your debt hedge loss in the second quarter? You mentioned that other income is down $426 million, was that the amount of the debt hedge loss or is it different? John Shrewsberry : It was - we had a $127 million gain in the first quarter and $193 million loss in the second quarter. And again, I just want to describe that as the accounting treatment for the hedging program that we have there. But, so, think of this \u2013 that the delta between Q1 and Q2 as what creates the more outsized numbers. Mike Mayo : So normal would just be zero? John Stumpf : No, normal would be around zero. You\u2019d expect it to be zero over its life. Sometimes it's a little positive sometimes it's a little negative. And it's driven by swap rates and currency movements in the currencies where we issue. Mike Mayo : All right. The more important question from me, you mentioned repricing in wholesale businesses and at \u2013 what are you doing there as it relates to your market-sensitive revenues? John Stumpf : What we repriced in wholesale is deposits and for a variety of customers, the ones who seem to have acted most strongly in the deposit area were FIs, which for all the reasons you could imagine how relatively low value liquidity deposits and so, we have \u2013 we\u2019ve been paying less for those deposits or in some cases, and in some jurisdictions, have been charging a little bit for those deposits and that's what we were referring to. Mike Mayo : What are you seeing in pricing in your market-sensitive businesses more generally? And is that one reason why your \u2013 this is the lowest trading quarter you've had since the third quarter of 2011 and we'll certainly take the other revenues in lieu of trading. But, are you pricing some of those activities away? Is it simply the markets weaker? What's going on there? But especially as it relates to potential repricing or the competitive environment? John Stumpf : Yes, you know, it's not as a result of Wells Fargo specific pricing strategies. It's just the chips falling where they did in terms of flows, volumes and other activity in the business. And as you know, in our trading business, we have what you are thinking of which is market-making and customer accommodation activity but we also have the impact of our own deferred comp program, et cetera, which makes that line a little bit noisy. But it's not as a result of any conscious business decision to price things differently to do any more of this or less of that it's just where the quarter fell. Mike Mayo : And then lastly, and so is pricing getting better, worse and if so, what areas within the market-sensitive areas? John Shrewsberry : I wouldn't say that pricing is getting any better. You would think that pricing might be getting better in areas where other banks are pulling back from providing financing or liquidity to customers, which is part of the discussion around how some of the bigger trading-oriented banks have been providing repo, providing securities finance, et cetera, and have limited their appetites. But prices haven't gone up that much. I think capacity has come out and people have had to figure out how to deal with that. So, at the moment, it's still very - it's as competitive as it ever was and the pricing reflects that, but not because of conscious strategies. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. John Shrewsberry : Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. I just had one question to clarify the loan growth expectations. And if I look at the core loan growth, it's growing about excluding the GE transaction and run-off, it's growing at about almost four times nominal GDP, which would be at the higher end of the historical norm. So, I just want to make sure I understand, John, your comments about expectations of maybe some incremental leverage across both commercial and consumer. But I wonder to what extent it may in fact that may already be occurring and the GDP number will move to reflect that rather than an acceleration in loan growth? John Shrewsberry : That's good question. We don't model loan growth necessarily as a reflection of prior quarter GDP. But it's an interesting relationship. I think our point is that the areas where we've been experiencing organic loan growth all are still very active. We are still very competitive. We are getting more than our fair share in most of those categories. We've got further to run in car and I\u2019d say than other people because we are starting from a smaller base. And then in some of our material businesses, we've got customers who have been holding back on their borrowing capacity. So in the corporate - but in the commercial space in particular where we are a very big player, our customers are still very cash-heavy, which is reflected in our deposits and have maintained very low leverage profile. So that if they got a little bit more enthusiasm around M&A, around organic growth or building a new plant, et cetera, expanding their businesses, they have lots of debt capacity to do that, and we\u2019d expect to see some of that in line utilization or demand for funded assets. But, the real takeaway is that we're very well positioned in all of our key lending markets and competing well today. And in those areas where there might be incremental drivers of demand and we hope to benefit from it when it happens. And then, of course, we are working on a few strategic or inorganic activities as well. Eric Wasserstrom : Sure. Thank you for that, and just one clarification question. Did you indicate how much your legal accrual was for the period? John Shrewsberry : We didn't. We\u2019ve indicated the size of operating losses in total. The amount of the change and the amount of the changes reflected \u2013 reflects increased litigation accruals, but we don't split that out from our other operating losses. Eric Wasserstrom : And are those legal accruals for issues related disclosed in the 10-K or for new ones? John Shrewsberry : It's for a variety of matters, most of which you would already be familiar with. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay, all right. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor : Good morning. John Shrewsberry : Hey, Matt. Good morning.. Matt O'Connor : I know there's been some talk about working on becoming more efficient, just kind of continuous improvement. But do you have some formal initiative underway? I guess there was an article in a regional paper a couple months ago and it mentioned something called E&E, or something along the lines of that? John Shrewsberry : Yes, that's \u2013 as John was mentioning earlier, we are trying to repurpose our expense dollars to their highest value area. And so there is a collection of programs and ways of doing business, of thinking about how we spend our resources that are designed to do just that. So it's an internal, it's a relatively formal program. It's around some operational improvements. It's around some of our staff functional alignment. Some of our technology spend, et cetera, and it really is designed to make sure that where we are spending money and of course we spend a lot of it that we are putting it in the most impactful places. Matt O'Connor : Is it the kind of program where, if we don't get rates increasing and a stronger economy, then you can kind of redirect some of the savings more to the bottom-line versus investing in other areas? John Shrewsberry : Well, dollars are fungible, but as the way we are thinking about it is, we are directing those dollars toward places they are going to make a difference for customers which would drive revenue. And they could see bottom-line improvement as a result of that. But as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, it's not really designed to drive us down in the efficiency ratio or to drive total dollars of expense down. All things being equal, it's designed to make sure that we are spending the money that we are spending in the most impactful place. Matt O'Connor : Okay. And then just separately on the net interest margin, as we think about the trajectory from here, assuming rates don't increase, what should the path of the NIM be? John Shrewsberry : Well, it's going to depend on what happens with deposits versus loan and other earning asset growth primarily. So, if we continue along the path that we are on right now, then you would think that it would probably stay in or about this range. There is not much else, deposit pricing is quite efficient here at 8 basis points. So, as we get more invested, as we add more loans and if we convert cash to higher yielding assets then that should be an improvement. Over the course, if you fast forward it to few years, we'll probably be layering in more senior unsecured in connection with TLAC. That will probably have a negative impact, although relatively modest in the overall scheme of things. We still expect net interest income in 2015 to be higher than 2014, which is frankly, the most important thing, all things being equal and that's what we are driving toward. John Stumpf : Let me just go back to the expensing just one more time so we are all on the same page. There is talk on this call, and of course, we listen to what the Chairwoman of the FED has to say about rates. But when we plan internally here, we don't consider rate increases as part of the ongoing justification for an investment in anything. So in other words, we don't \u2013 you would not hear a language like, I want to make this investment because when rates turnaround and go back up, then this justifies, this investment will be justified. We don't know what's going to happen to rates and if rates do increase, either long-term or the short-end or both that's a benefit to us. But, for the last five six years, you could have said the same thing and it didn't happen. So that's why there is a continual consideration here and pushing ourselves and our thinking to eliminate work that's no longer beneficial, taking out processes that don't add values and investing in places and things that do add value and make us more competitive, more nimble, more relative to the constituents that we serve. Matt O'Connor : Great. Thank you. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. John Stumpf : Good morning. John Pancari : Just a couple quick areas I want to ask about. On the commercial loan yields, it looks like they were up pretty solidly 7% to 8%, or 7 to 8 bps or so for the quarter. Just want to see if we can get a little bit of color on what drove that? John Shrewsberry : Sure, so there is a handful of things. I mean it's the mix of the assets that we are adding to that portfolio from one period to the next, which reflects customer activity, customer demand, both in terms of what's rolling on and what's rolling off. Also, you are seeing in that calculation, the impact of having swapped portions of that portfolio from floating to fixed, because that impacts the yield. We've done that partially as the recognition that we think we are going to be in a lower long-term rate environment for a longer period of time than we might have previously thought. So, that impact is \u2013 runs through there as well, still asset-sensitive, but not waiting forever for rates to begin to move in that portfolio. John Pancari : Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then on the credit front, back to the energy thing, just real quick, any clarity on how much of that increase in the energy-related non-accruals were E&P versus oil service, and then separately, it sounds like some of this movement may have been related to the shared national credit exam. Was there anything non-energy that may have been - any takeaways out of the shared national credit exam that may have impacted your non-energy portfolio? John Shrewsberry : So on the first question, like - remind me the first question again. John Pancari : Yes, just of the\u2026 John Shrewsberry : E&P, it was predominantly all E&P. The services credits have \u2013 first of all, they don't go through the exact same, there is no borrowing base re-determination to occur in services companies; it's more like any other corporate in terms of how they are reviewed. But the impact has not been felt there in quite the same way as it has with E&P companies. And then back to the shared national credit review, in terms of the negative outcomes or the suggested downgrades, it really was primarily an energy set of conclusions this time around. John Pancari : Okay, all right. And then lastly, the home equity portfolio, just one of you can give us an update there. As you are seeing some of the lines exit their draw periods, want to see how those credits have been performing and you're seeing any migration there. John Shrewsberry : Well, we've been \u2013 as we've talked about, ahead of this end of draw expectation for sometime now, because it was pretty easy to schedule and we are going into a couple of years when those 10-year draw periods will be coming to a close from the heaviest periods of issuance right at the \u2013 prior to the turn of the cycle and, frankly, I\u2019d say, we are experiencing a better outcome than we originally imagined in part because of our \u2013 because of our - the focus that we've had, the team that we've had facing, the proactive work that we're emphasizing trying to get people refied into something that is suitable or more tolerable for them to repay. So, things are going well. John Stumpf : And losses in that portfolio this quarter are in the 56 or 57 basis point range. John Shrewsberry : Yes, very tolerable. John Stumpf : Very tolerable. John Pancari : Okay, on that front, I mean, do you know how much \u2013 what percentage of your 2005 originations may have been refied already or worked down? John Shrewsberry : I don't \u2013 right I don\u2019t at the - on this call, our real estate group certainly knows, because that's how that's been managed. So they'll know what they have left and what is gone already. But, when I'm focusing on when I say that there is a plan underway that's being executed that's working, of course for the ones that are still there and then have it refied out. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thanks for taking my questions. John Shrewsberry : Sure. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks. I had a question on \u2013 you talked about the duration of the balance sheet and you are doing that through swaps and through investment portfolio purchases. Can you give us a feel for, half-a-year, six months, is it nine months and how far do you want to go in the duration of the portfolio or the overall balance sheet? So, how far are we along that process? John Shrewsberry : So, when we use the term duration, we are using it in that context, but not to define a duration of the balance sheet, but really to think about using those tools, the investment portfolio and loan portfolios to impact our overall asset or liability sensitivity. And so the net conclusion of that is that, not terribly unlike where we were at our last Investor Day. We find ourselves still asset-sensitive. We mentioned a year ago, May that we thought that we were \u2013 we had probably 10 to 30 basis points worth of net sensitivity \u2013 net benefit from a 100 basis point instantaneous parallel movement in rates. Very stylized example. And we are less asset-sensitive. If we were at the mean then, we're at the lower-end of that range today we believe. It's probably a conservative estimate. We - that's how we generally calculate things. But by adding securities, by swapping floating rates to fixed, and other actions that have occurred in the growth of the business, we've made ourselves a little bit less asset-sensitive because of the belief that we could be in a lower rate environment for a longer period of time and we are earning today rather than maintaining all of that sensitivity for the future. We still have plenty of it and we'll develop more of it as time passes, but that's how I would answer that question. Marty Mosby : And would you see any more lengthening in the near-term, given the steepness of the yield curve now gives you an opportunity to kind of productively use that to your advantage? John Shrewsberry : I would expect that we\u2019d continue to be adding securities to our securities portfolio, for sure. Marty Mosby : And then lastly, the mortgage banking pipeline was very strong going into the second quarter. It looks like the pull through was about as low as we've seen in the last year. I was just curious if there was any operational issue or anything that happened during the quarter? Was it just refis that never got closed? What was kind of the difference in the pull through for this particular quarter? John Shrewsberry : There is nothing that I would point to. We -- the production occurred the way we would have expected it to. We ended with a relatively long \u2013 relatively large pipeline as well. So, nothing different there. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point. Please go ahead. Kevin Barker : Just a quick follow-up on the some of the mortgage banking results, you saw margins remain pretty strong compared to what you've had over historical basis and they were strong in the first quarter despite the decline in the primary/secondary spread. Now the front-half of the quarter looked a lot stronger than the second half of the quarter. Could you just give us some detail between the differences what you saw in maybe April and early May versus what you saw in the back half of the quarter? John Shrewsberry : Yes, it's tough to be that precise about it although I'm sure there are people in Wells Fargo Home Mortgage who are thinking about it as granularly as the question that you are asking. Certainly, in the first quarter as rates rallied hard and that pipeline really, really grew, applications came in at an increased pace. The capacity constraints to deal with that both at Wells Fargo and in the industry are supportive of higher margins as people use their scarce capacity as beneficially as they can. So you'd expect, if that's a high point for things to slip a little bit from there. In terms of where they've gotten to and where they are now, we expect them to continue to be in that range. The full range, frankly is a pretty attractive place to be operating. And as long as we can stay higher in the range like we have, we\u2019ll be thrilled to that to happen. There is also, from one quarter to the next, the mix between what's happening in retail versus what's happening through others is going to influence our gain on sale and that might look different from one originator to another. I think that's an important consideration. But, I mean, frankly, I would look at it quarter-to-quarter and then seasonally adjust it to think about what the steady-state is. But the last thing I'd say is that we are - again, we're pretty happy with where things have remained, given how competitive that market is, given how much capacity there is and we're happy to be operating here. John Stumpf : Yes, I think, just to support John's comment, I remember when gain on sales - years ago were 40, 50, 60 basis points. So the pricing discipline, even with the capacity and the size of the market is a \u2013 I think a good thing for Americans, good thing for borrowers, good thing for the originators, because we are getting paid for the work that we're doing, the value-add. Kevin Barker : Okay and then just to mention - follow-up on some of the comments on the extension of the duration of the balance sheet this quarter with the use of interest rate swaps. Could you provide some more details on why you are increasing your duration at this point in the cycle? Is it a change in your view on, whether you want to be patient for higher rates or is there some other reason why you would extend the duration now? John Shrewsberry : So, what's been happening for a while, we are talking about it a little bit more now and maybe it was a little bit starker in this quarter because deposit growth slowed also, so you saw cash balances go down while both securities and loans went up. But as you suggest, it\u2019s regardless of what's happening with short-term rates and over what period of time that normalization of policy occurs, it's our expectation that the longer-end of the curve, that we are going to be lower for longer than we would have thought six months ago, a year ago, or a couple of years ago and how we are managing the balance sheet is a reflection of that. Kevin Barker : Is there anything specific that you are seeing that would change your view that has changed your view in the last six months? John Shrewsberry : Well, in the last 6 to 12 months, I would say, what's happened with rates around the world has been a big reminder that a 2.5% US tenure is a really attractive asset and could be for a really long time. So that's why I say regardless of what's happening with Fed funds, we are preparing ourselves for a long march on - at the longer end of the curve. And if we are wrong, we have to be prepared for that in terms of what it means to capital et cetera, and we certainly are and we - that drastically to make sure that we've protected our balance sheet. But in the mean time, we are getting our assets more productively deployed. I would point out, there is still $250 billion worth of cash in the bank. So there is plenty of short-term liquidity and dry powder for what happens if we are wrong and there are more attractive entry points on the way back up, if that were to occur, but it's a good question. Kevin Barker : Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your last question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : The best for last. John Stumpf : Always. Hi, Nancy. Nancy Bush : Hi, couple questions on the mortgage front. JPMorgan Chase reported a very strong production quarter in jumbo mortgages this morning. How are you guys positioned in that market and what percentage or rough percentage of your production are jumbos? John Shrewsberry : About 25% of our production are jumbos and that includes, of course, many of our most valuable customers in terms of the breadth of the total relationship. We carry them on our balance sheet as you know. Nancy Bush : Right. John Shrewsberry : And, I think the total category right now for jumbos on our books is about $120 billion, $125 billion of the - call it $1.7 trillion overall. Nancy Bush : Okay. And just a question on the mortgage business as a whole, I mean, do you consider at this point, given all the gyrations we've had in the mortgage business in the past ten years, are we at what you consider to be, a normal mortgage market right now and are you staffed appropriately for that market or where does sort of the mechanics of the mortgage business stand for you right now? John Shrewsberry : So, in terms of staffing, I am sure it's true that we are probably a little bit heavy in some areas around loss mitigation and working NPA's and foreclosed assets through the system versus where we might be in a completely normalized point in the cycle just because they are still elevated. So there is probably opportunity there over some period of time. From a policy normalcy point of view, there is still other things happening, whether it's agency reform, the relationship between the FHA and the industry is still not completely settled and that has to happen for people to feel good about things. We are still in those second - no meaningful secondary market for non-conforming loans and there was a good one for prime, jumbo loans that existed pre-crisis and so at some point that probably has to re-emerge and that hasn't happened yet. But, we are just as committed to the business. It's a very important part of the relationship between us and our customers, because buying and financing a home is one of the most significant things our customers will ever do. We enjoy our status as the largest mortgage servicer in the land and our status as the largest mortgage originator as well. So, we are working hard to try and shape good outcomes in those areas that are still unsettled and we are making the most of it during the period that we are in. John Stumpf : And, Nancy, it's an insightful question because I think part of the distinguishing features of big scale players in this business where you are successful or not is how quickly you can scale up when business opportunities present themselves and how quickly you can scale down. And, we think we are pretty good at that among other things. And some are surprised that mortgage market has not come back stronger, but we went through a pretty deep downturn. This was the asset class that had the problem in 2008 and 2009 and it steadily \u2013 and it's improving and healing. But it's going to take time. And so, like John said, we really like this business for a whole host of reasons. Nancy Bush : I would just ask as an add-on question, Bank of America talks about their legacy asset servicing, et cetera, which is mostly mortgages that were still on the books that they are working out. Where are you guys in - working out any problems you got through the Wachovia deal, et cetera? I mean, are you pretty much through the workout period now with most of that stuff? John Stumpf : Well, the pick-a-pay was probably the most problematic of that portfolio and that came over - let's say in the $120 billion range - $120 billion or so; and it\u2019s $54 billion give or take now. And the average loan to value in that is in the 60s. Nancy Bush : All right. John Stumpf : So, and if you look at -- if you look at the overall servicing portfolio we have, it's 94%, 95% current and so it\u2019s - we've -- still issues going through there, there is some judicial foreclosure states that we are still having to work through. But for the most part, it's performed above our expectations, especially with respect to the Wachovia part and I think we are in the later innings of working on this and as John mentioned, there is some opportunity to take some cost out. The cost of servicing a current loan versus one that's delinquent is such a big difference. So, when people look at these portfolios you like to look at the past dues, because it really \u2013 and the ones in the foreclosures because that really skews the costs on those. John Shrewsberry : I know that this is clear in the materials, Nancy, but we are \u2013 where our non-strategic or wind down portfolio is picking down at $2 billion to $3 billion per quarter and there is $50 billion odd of it left. So, the tail of it will be here for a while. Nancy Bush : Okay. All right, thank you very much. John Stumpf : Thank you. Well, this concludes our call. Thank you again for spending time with us. It's always enjoyable for us to represent our 265,000 team members and the work that they do every quarter and John and I and Jim will see you on next quarter. Thank you very much.

I will now turn our call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf. John Stumpf : Thank you, Jim. And thank you, good morning and thanks for joining us today. We earned $5.8 billion in the third quarter, as our diversified business model generated growth in revenue, loans, deposits and net income compared with a year ago. We remain focussed on meeting the financial needs of our customers and are investing in businesses so we may continue to meet the evolving needs of our customers in the future. The strength of our franchise also positioned us well for the acquisitions we have recently announced. We are excited that the transactions with GE Capital will enable us to deepen relationships and increase our presence in commercial businesses that serve the real economy. General Electric, like Wells Fargo is one of America\u2019s great companies and the businesses we are acquiring are industry leaders with proven business models and exceptionally talented and experienced people. We are excited to have them join the Wells Fargo team. John Shrewsberry will provide more details on the recent GE Capital announcements at the end of the call. Let me now highlight our results this quarter compared with the year ago. We earned $1.05 in earnings per share, up 3% from a year ago. We generated $21.9 billion of revenue, up 3% with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income. We grew pre-tax, pre provision profit by 6%. We continue to have broad based loan growth with total loans reaching a record $903.2 billion. This is a bit larger than the size of our loan portfolio at the time of the Wachovia merger at the end of 2008. However, the quality of our current portfolio is significantly better than at the time of the merger. Our core loan portfolio increased by $73.4 billion, or 9% from a year ago reflecting both strong organic growth and the benefit of the acquisitions we have completed over the past year. Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with total deposits reaching a record $1.2 trillion up $71.6 billion or 6% from a year ago and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.8%. Our financial performance resulted in strong capital generation and returning capital to our shareholders remains our priority. Our dividend payout ratio is 35% and we repurchased 52 million shares of common stock in the third quarter. Turning to the economic environment, the global economy showed some signs of weakness in the third quarter, primarily in China and other emerging markets. This weakness impacted the financial markets and the rising value of the U.S. dollar has caused the trade deficit to widen. As you know, Wells Fargo is a U.S. centric company and the U.S. economy while not immune to these developments has proven quite resilient. The low energy prices that are negatively impacting certain aspects of the economy have provided a welcome boost to consumers with many now beginning to redirect their savings into purchasing goods and services. As an example, new auto sales were at their highest levels in a decade. Housing continued to rebound with home sales at their highest level since 2009 and a limited supply of homes of new homes are driving new home constructions and while the latest jobs report was disappointing relative to expectations the labor market continue to show steady gains with September posting the 60th consecutive month of rising employment something never before accomplished and the unemployment rate is at a level that many consider to be the long term norm. As the U.S. and the world economies evolve, Well Fargo remains focussed on the building blocks of our growth. Increasing the number of household reserve, adding commercial relationships, deepening consumer and commercial relationships and growing loans and deposits, this focus will benefit our long term growth while we continue to meet our customers financial needs and navigate the challenges of today\u2019s economy. John Shrewsberry, our CFO will now provide more details on our third quarter results. John? John Shrewsberry : Thank you, John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. Our third quarter results demonstrated consistent financial performance and momentum across a variety of key business drivers. We continued to have strong loan and deposit growth across our diversified commercial and consumer businesses. We grew revenue by generating growth in net interest income and non-interest income. We produced positive operating leverage as our expenses declined. Credit quality remained strong with net charge-offs of only 31 basis points of average loans and we operated within our targeted ranges for ROA, ROE, efficiency and net payout ratio. Let me now highlight these key drivers in more detail. On page three, we showed the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted including revenue, pre-tax, pre provision profit, loans, deposits, net income and EPS and we reduced our common shares outstanding by 106.5 million shares over the past year. Turning to page four, we continued to benefit from the strength of our balance sheet which has positioned us well to take advantage of growth opportunities including our recently announced acquisitions. We grew total assets by 7% from a year ago and 2% from second quarter with growth in loans, short term investments and investment securities. Our funding sources increased with continued deposit growth and increased long term debt and short term borrowings. Turning to the income statement overview on page five, revenue increased $557 million from the second quarter with growth in net interest and non-interest income and we generated positive operating leverage as expenses declined. As shown on page six, we had strong broad based loan growth in the third quarter, our 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Our core loan portfolio grew by $73.4 billion or 9% from a year ago and was up $17.1 billion from the second quarter. Commercial loans grew $9.4 billion and consumer loans grew $7.7 billion from the second quarter. Our total loan portfolio is balanced between commercial and consumer loans with commercial loans now 50% of our portfolio. Our portfolio has become more balanced as we have experienced run off in our liquidating consumer portfolios and have growth our commercial portfolios through organic growth and acquisition. On page seven, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $38 billion or 15% from a year ago, the growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double digit year-over-year growth and asset backed finance, corporate banking, commercial real estate, structured real estate and government and institutional banking. Commercial real estate loans grew $12.8 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter of GE Capital transaction and organic growth. Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $15.3 billion or 7% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non-conforming mortgages. Credit card balances were up $4 billion or 14% from a year ago benefitting from strong new account growth, more active accounts and the Dillard\u2019s portfolio acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2014. Auto loans were up $3.9 billion or 7% from last year. We had record new originations in the third quarter up 10% from a year ago reflecting the strong auto market while we have remained disciplined in our approach. As highlighted on page eight, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter up $71.8 billion from a year ago and up $13.6 billion from the second quarter. This growth was broad based across our commercial and consumer businesses. Our average deposit cost was 8 basis points down 2 basis points from a year ago and stable with the second quarter. We continued to successfully grow our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5.8% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers increased 5%. Page nine highlights our revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. Our earning asset mix results and diversified sources of interest income and the drivers of fee generation are diverse also. We had strong equity gains in the third quarter comprising 9% of our fee income up from 5% last quarter and 7% a year ago. Our total market sensitive revenue which includes trading and gains from debt and equity investments increased $210 million from second quarter but was down slightly from a year ago. We grew net interest income $516 million or 5% from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in loans and securities and by adding duration to the balance sheet. The $187 million increase in net interest income from the second quarter reflected growth in investments and loans including the benefit from the GE Capital loan purchase and financing transaction related to commercial real estate assets that settled late in the second quarter. Net interest income also reflected one additional day in the quarter accounting for about one third of the increase from the second quarter. These benefits were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources including purchased credit impaired loan recoveries, periodic dividends and loan fees. The net interest margin declined 1 basis points from the second quarter. The decline was due to customer driven deposit growth which reduced the margin by 3 basis points, but had minimal impact to net interest income. Lower income from variable sources also reduced the margin by 3 basis points, these decreases were partially offset by balance sheet growth and repricing driven by security purchases and higher loan balances which benefited the margin by 5 basis points. As I have discussed previously our view on interest rates has evolved over the past year to be more of a lower for longer expectation for both short term and long term rates. As a result, we\u2019ve been adding duration to our balance sheet, however our balance sheet remains asset sensitive and we are positioned to benefit from higher rates and we expect to be able to grow net interest income over the long term even if the rate environment continues to be challenging. Total non-interest income increased $370 million from second quarter, driven by higher equity gains, other income, deposit service charges and card fees. Gains from equity investments were up $403 million from the second quarter reflecting strong results from venture capital, private equity and other investments. We recognized gains on more than 10 different holdings demonstrating the diversity of our equity portfolio and our long term commitment to this business. Non-controlling interest reduced the impact of the equity gains through our net income and increased $120 million from the second quarter. The other non-interest income category was up $406 million in the third quarter driven by the impact of lower interest rates on our long term, our long term debt hedges. As a reminder, we required from an accounting perspective to measure the hedge effectiveness at the end of each quarter and while the net impact is generally expected to be zero over the life an instrument, interest rate and currency volatility can cause this line item to vary from quarter to quarter. Other income also increased from higher income on our equity method investments as well as the gain on our sale of warranty solutions which happened in the third quarter. Mortgage banking revenue declined $116 million from the second quarter. Origination volume of $55 billion was down 11% from the second quarter reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 15% from a year ago benefitting from a stronger housing market. 66% of originations were for purchases in the third quarter up from 54% in the second quarter. We ended the quarter with a $34 billion application pipeline down 11% from the second quarter but up 36% from a year earlier. Based on the current rate environment, the level of our pipeline and the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market we currently expect originations in the fourth quarter to be lower than the third quarter. Our production margin on residential held for sale mortgage originations was 188 basis points in the third quarter. This ratio has been refined from how it was determined in prior quarters in an effort to provide investors with better information on a residential originate and sell business. Based on our updated approach, we currently expect our production margin in the fourth quarter to remain within the range of the past five quarters at 170 basis points to 195 basis points. As shown on page 12, expenses were down $70 million from the second quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower employee benefits from reduced deferred compensation expense which was largely offset in trading, expenses also benefited from lower advertising expense and reduced insurance expense reflecting seasonally lower, premium driven compensation costs in crop insurance. We also made a $126 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation which increased other non-interest expense. Operating losses were stable from the second quarter but they remained higher than the five quarter average as we continued to have elevated litigation accruals for various legal matters. We continued to invest in our businesses with particular focus on risk, cyber and technology projects. These investments partially reflected in higher outside professional services expense in the quarter. Our efficiency ratio improved to 56.7% in the third quarter. We are focussed on managing expenses, partially reflected in the 27% reduction in travel and entertainment expense from a year ago as we reduced non-customer facing travel, however we expect to operate at the higher end of our target efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2015 and until our revenue benefits from higher rates we expect to remain at the upper end of that range. Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 13, community banking earned $3.7 billion in the third quarter, up 7% from a year ago and up 10% from second quarter. One of the drivers of our long-term growth is our ability to attract new households to Wells Fargo. Year-to-date through August, we\u2019ve had the strongest new retail bank household growth in four years, and during the third quarter we announced an initiative that makes the experience of opening an account easier for the millions of consumers which used to bank with us. Our new and existing customers are increasingly using our digital offerings with active online customers up 8% and active mobile customers up 17% from a year ago. We are growing our credit and debit card businesses through new customer growth and increased usage among existing customers. Credit card purchase volume was $18 million up 15% from a year ago and debit card purchase volume was $71 million up 8% from a year ago. Our Wells Brokerage and Retirement segment has been renamed Wealth and Investment management, reflecting the realignment of our asset management business from wholesale banking into wealth and investment management. We also moved our reinsurance business from wealth and investment management and our strategic auto investments from community banking into wholesale banking. These changes are part of our regular course of business. We are always looking for ways to better align our businesses, deepen existing customer relationships and create a best-in-class structure to benefit both our customers and our shareholders. For comparative purposes prior period segment results have been revised to reflect these changes. Despite a challenging equity market environment, wealth and investment management earned $606 million in the third quarter up 10% from a year ago and up 3% from the second quarter. These results reflect a strong balance sheet growth and net interest income growing 18% from a year ago. Average core deposits grew 6% from a year ago and loans grew 16% in the ninth consecutive quarter of double digit year-over-year growth. Loan growth was driven by an increase in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans and security based lending. Retail brokerage and managed account assets were flat from a year ago and down 6% from second quarter, the length quarter declined reflected the weak equity markets. As a reminder, managed account asset fees are priced at the beginning of the quarter so fourth quarter fees will reflect the weaker September 30th market valuations. Wholesale banking earned $1.8 billion in the third quarter, down 8% from a year ago and 13% from second quarter. The length quarter decline was driven by lower non-interest income primarily as a result of lower equity investment gains and reduced sales in trading and investment banking activity reflecting market volatility. Balance sheet growth remained strong with average loan growth of 15% from a year ago. This growth benefited from the GE Capital loan purchase related to commercial real estate assets that closed last quarter and also reflected broad based growth across most wholesale businesses. Average core deposits grew 12% from a year ago. Treasury management revenue continued to grow up 9% from a year ago driven by new sales of treasury management solutions. Turning to Page 16, credit quality remained strong in the third quarter. Our net charge-off rate was 31 basis points of average loans, up slightly from second quarter primarily from seasonally higher auto losses. Non-performing assets have declined for 12 consecutive quarters and were down $1.1 billion from the second quarter. This improvement was broad based driven by improvements in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios. We did not have a reserve release in the third quarter; the first quarter was no reserve release since the first quarter of 2010. While we continue to benefit from improvements in the performance of our residential real estate portfolio we also increased commercial reserves reflecting deterioration in the energy sector. As a reminder, only 2% of our total loans outstanding are in the oil and gas sector and we continue to work proactively with our customers as we manage through the current industry cycle. We've started the fall redeterminations and reserve-based energy loans are performing as expected. We believe the energy services sector will incur greater challenges in the near term as it adjusts to lower commodity prices and this view was reflected in our reserving process. We\u2019re also monitoring all loan types in MSAs where greater than 3% of employment is directly tied to oil production. To date, while we have not experienced measurable differences in the portfolio of performance between oil and non-oil communities, overtime we would expect some co-related stress in communities that are dependant on oil and gas. Future allowance levels whether they are higher or lower will be driven by a variety of factors including loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic conditions. Turning to Page 17, our capital level remains strong with our estimated common equity tier-1 ratio under Basel-3 fully phased in at 10.7% in the third quarter. We returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends and net share repurchases and our net payout ratio was 60%. In summary, our third quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with strong growth in loans and deposits and revenue growth reflecting higher net interest and higher non-interest income. Our returns are among the best in the industry with an ROA of 132 basis points and an ROE of 12.62%. Our strong liquidity and capital positions us well to serve our existing customers while growing our customer base organically and through acquisitions. Let me conclude by highlighting the transactions we\u2019ve announced over the past couple of weeks. We summarized these announcements starting on slide 20. As John mentioned earlier, operating from a position of strength allows us to make quality acquisitions that help us serve more markets and meet more of our customer\u2019s financial needs. In connection with these transactions, we\u2019ve maintained our long standing discipline due diligence process and our strong capital position provides us with the capacity to acquire these businesses and assets. I\u2019ll start by highlighting the largest transaction which involves approximately $32 billion of assets. Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire GE Capital\u2019s commercial distribution, finance and vendor finance businesses as well as certain corporate finance loan and lease assets. Over 600 Wells Fargo team members were involved in the evaluation and due diligence which occurred over the past few months. This agreement provides us with a unique opportunity to add relationships and earning assets in businesses where GE Capital was an unequivocal market leader and where we either have meaningful experience or in the case of commercial distribution finance is a strong compliment to our existing capabilities. These businesses have established in deep relationships with their customers and we are excited about the opportunity to enhance these relationships with the breadth of our product offerings. These businesses are run by experienced teams with average tenures of over 20 years. We will also benefit from the acquisition of GE Capital state of the art customer facing systems that will create efficiencies. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of 2016 with minimal impact on our liquidity position. Over the medium to long term, we plan to fund the acquisition with anticipated growth and deposits and in the short term we will likely have to increase our borrowings to preserve our liquidity position. Similar to the GE Capital transaction related to commercial real estate assets that closed in the second quarter, the loans releases roughly 90% based in U.S. and Canada will be recorded a fair value inclusive of a life time credit loss at close, including transition cost related to integrating these businesses we expect this acquisition to be neutral to modestly accretive to our 2016 results. At the end of September, we also announced an agreement to acquire GE railcar services, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. This transaction involves 77,000 railcars and just over 1000 locomotives as well as associated operating at long term leases that will be added to our existing First Union Rail business, making us the second largest railcar and locomotive leasing company in North America. Similar to GE Capital transaction that they completed earlier this year, we were able to find a partner, in this case, a Berkshire Hathaway Company, to agree to acquire the assets that did not align well with our business strategy. This acquisition will add to the quality and diversification of our existing fleet and add to our capacity to meet the industries growing demand for railcars. Just to summarize the timing related to our GE transactions, our results this quarter include the impact from the GE Capital transaction related to commercial real estate assets that closed in the second quarter and we expect to close in the first quarter of 2016 the GE railcar transaction and the GE Capital transactions we announced yesterday. John and I will now be happy to answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Morford : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone -- good morning, everyone. Still too early. John Stumpf : Hi, Joe, good morning. Joe Morford : Just -- I guess following up first on the last comments about the GE Capital acquisitions, just I guess curious to learn a little bit more about fit with the existing platform that you have where some of the synergies are. And then, any color you may be able to share in terms of the profitability of these businesses or the relative yields. I guess I was a little surprised you're saying maybe only modest earnings accretion. Is that due to some of the expenses you're bringing on with their staff and/or the higher near-term borrowing costs? John Stumpf : So with respect to the first part of your question, Joe the businesses line up well as we said the commercial distribution finance business is an asset based lending business that operates between OEMs on the one hand and the distributors on the other. It will fit in Well Fargo alongside what we describe as Well Fargo Capital Finance, our ABL business. The GE team has leadership and speciality in their version of ABL lending but of course we\u2019ve got the team that\u2019s been together for 20 plus years in ABL and this will complement them nicely. And as we mentioned the technology that they used to run their business is also something that we think we can benefit from in our broader business overtime. The vendor finance business aligns well with our equipment finance business. Our equipment finance business tends to focus on the users of equipment, their equipment finance business has big relationships with OEMs who are selling equipment and so we think that they are very complimentary when put together. With respect to the question about 2016 accretion, we think there will be plenty of expenses in order -- people expenses, technology integration expenses, premises expenses perhaps another thing. So we're focused on doing that integration the right way. It's going to take some time. We're going to be very thoughtful about it. And we're more focused on the medium to long term impact than what this means in 2016. John Shrewsberry : Joe, I've been around the acquisition game for a long time and what we typical have said in the past and this is probably truer with the depository that we look for accretion by year three. It will happen sooner in this case, because its not as complex, but we have learned that to do these things well you practice on yourself not on your customers. You get everything done right and we really look at this as John mentioned, as a long-term value-add to the company. So things that closed in the first quarter you bound to have expenses around integration to get this really done right. John Stumpf : Actually Joe, you also asked about funding. And that is part of the equation here. We will be term funding components of this, so it's not as easy as absorbing existing cash. I think some of the early analyst reports have reflected that belief. So, we'll be layering in some term funding in advance of the assets coming on. Then we'll have some incremental costs et cetera and we're trying to maintain our liquidity buffers through and after the addition of these assets. So, makes it a little bit more complicated than some of the math that I've seen so far. Joe Morford : Okay. That's all really helpful. I appreciate that color. I guess the other question was just I recognize the equity investment gains this quarter really came from a number of different investments. But any color on maybe what's a good run rate there or just maybe market sensitive revenues overall, recognizing they were down a couple hundred million this quarter? John Shrewsberry : In both cases I would look at something like a five-quarter average of equity gains on its own and then equity gains, gains on debt and trading activities as well. I think they're probably more representative of a run rate. Joe Morford : Okay. Thanks so much. John Shrewsberry : You're welcome, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks for taking my questions. You talked about the expenses being elevated with legal, and last quarter there was about a $225 million increase. Is that still the same number that's kind of embedded in the overall operating expenses this quarter? John Shrewsberry : Marty, there is going to be a run rate of what we had last quarter, where we are this quarter probably for a period of time. I mean, each individual legal matter is its own thing and we can't comment on litigation. But I would think of them as part of the environment that we're in and operating losses in total are probably going to remain about where they are. If they begin to come back down, that would be great. But I wouldn't consider this to be outsized at, call it, $500 million for the quarter for total operating losses. Marty Mosby : The other thing is that you look at wholesale banking, that's where you see some of the pressures that we have seen in other banks with capital markets activities. You had the reduction in the fee income but not much reduction in expenses. You talked about compensation expenses going lower but were offset by losses. Can you break those two things out so we can get a feel for the two components in the expense line? John Shrewsberry : So I would expect the expenses that are directly related to revenue to generally, especially over the course of the year to reflect their production of revenue might not be as linear from quarter to quarter as revenue moves up or down. And that's been true for some time. We have operating losses like a legal settlement for example, that will temporarily elevate expenses in that business unit at the firm while they may remain elevated, they don't necessarily remain elevated in wholesale banking or in any individual segment. So I wouldn't expect for example, compensation expenses cycle for the firm as a whole or for the division as a whole as a result of a one time in an operating loss. But all told, I would say that we pay for performance in that group. Our total approach to performance based comp seems to hold very well with the revenue sources that we have and the operating and the results of the segment make sense to the cycle or frankly for any full year. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Any further duration extension on the assets structure given the outlook that rates will stay lower for longer? I appreciate. John Shrewsberry : Not much. You can see that we added a few billion dollars of net securities to our investment portfolio. We like where we are from an asset sensitivity standpoint today. We're going to be adding these incremental assets that we talked about in connection with the GE portfolio, some of which are leases, so you think of them as a little bit longer term and fixed rate which will have the same impact as adding securities. So, we've slowed down a little bit in adding duration in the third quarter compared to the second quarter which I think you can see in the deck and we still have conviction that we're probably in a lower for longer rate scenario. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : I just wanted to follow-up on that last comment. You believe you're in a lower for longer rate environment. Do you think the U.S. economy is getting better or worse, I guess, I'm hearing on the one hand John you're mentioning some additional confidence in some areas. On the other hand you mentioned global economy is being the headwind, so which is it? Is the U.S. economy getting better or worse? John Stumpf : Yes, Mike, it\u2019s a good question. I think \u2013 we think it's getting better, but only incrementally better. So, as we \u2013 none of us know of course, but this year the GDP in the U.S. let's call it 2/1 maybe 2/2, maybe next year as maybe 2/5 something like that, 2/4 to 2/5, so better but not substantially better. You know us well, so you know that most of our business is U.S. centric, but clearly some of our businesses that we support and do business with have a international component to them, either sales or whatever the case is and the rest of the world, the biggest risk I think the U.S. economy is what's happening in the rest of the world, I think that's unquestionable. So \u2013 but better but not hugely better. John Shrewsberry : With respect to rates lower for longer applies. We think of it is at the short end and the medium to long end of the curve and so the Fed starts moving rates in December or in the first quarter, we will be sitting here a year from now we think with one, two or three, 25 basis point moves under our belt at probably best case with respect to how far things might move. And unless there's meaningful inflation which isn't anybody's radar screen right, than it doesn't feel like that's going to have an impact on long terms rates, it feels like more of a flatter curve environment and long rates in the vicinity of where they are now and what something really different begins to emerge. And of course like good news is for round about our forecast we performed better. We're constructing ourselves to do well in this environment. But if we end up in a higher short term or higher long-term rate environment than we're forecasting that's actually, that's not good for Wells Forgo. Mike Mayo : With that expectation are you taking the second look at expenses, I mean, your efficiency ratio this quarter moved in a better range, but do you have a plan B to say, we expect these headwinds to last for longer, therefore we're going to do something extra? John Shrewsberry : Yes. I describe it as a full time plan B, which is they were always looking a way to be more efficient. We highlighted a couple of them over the last few quarters. We took a hard look at T&E a year ago. We're down 25% year-over-year. We've talked about our real estate strategy we where shrunk by 20 million square feet over the last few years and still have more to go. As there are varieties of programs like that, but most of that savings gets absorbed by areas where we're changing or improving the firm. We're spending money on compliance, on risk management, on technology, on innovation. So I've got some conviction that we're not going to move below the higher end of our range, while we're still in this lower rate environment because whatever savings we get by being thrifty we end up reinvesting into the programs that I mentioned. John Stumpf : Yes. Just to put an emphasizes on that Mike, expenses get a lot of discussion around here and we are keenly focus on them, because as John mentioned he saved \u2013 and we think of it in ways of what will the customer pay for and what makes us a stronger long term provider of services to our customers and to be a more relevant company to all our constituents. And you save in one side and you invest on the other side. And some of those investments have been fairly significant. But it\u2019s a constant drumbeat around here. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. Just to follow-up on Joe's question. John, could you give us a sense of what the average yield of the 32 billion in GE assets that you're putting on and what the fee income generation was for last year? John Shrewsberry : No. Just because we haven't disclosed the yields on that portfolio, but I can tell you Erika, it looks a lot like our \u2013 like that portion of our own wholesale portfolio and I would add frankly that their approach to risk analysis of their loans looks like our risk analysis of their loans and their pricing on those loans looks like our pricing of similar loans. So, you should think of it as a component piece of what our wholesale banking outcomes look like. And in fee generation, is the question was GE generated in fees with those loans or what\u2026 Erika Najarian : Yes. Or is that business that you're acquiring generated in fees? John Shrewsberry : So, the revenue streams of that business are more net interest income streams rather than fee streams. I mean, there are certainly loan fees but they get amortized into yield. I can tell you in our own analysis of this and I'm sure in yours also, as we look out over some period of time we can imagine a lot of other products and services that we'll be providing to the same customers that GE wasn't in a position to offer them directly, so its part of the long-term value creation, but there's isn't a run rate that in there today, because GE was a primarily a lender rather than a full service provider of banking capabilities. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just wanted to get some clarification on your comments earlier because adding these assets have the same impact of extending duration on the asset side, should we expect cash balances to stay relatively stable from the average balances of the third quarter? John Shrewsberry : It depends on what's happening with deposit growth over the timeframe that we're talking about. This is five or six months in the future, so all things seeing equal, but maybe you could say us and by cash \u2013 cash and HQLA are high quality liquid assets are interchangeable in some ways, so I would look at the some of those things, not just cash depending on how our rate view evolves and what goes on in terms of the opportunity to get more invested et cetera. These are risk assets, that's one sort of use of cash, cash at the fed or cash in treasuries are two other related uses of cash so, I don't want to over complicated, but it\u2019s a little bit different than just the cash balance. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just to sneak one last one in. Your results clearly demonstrates your strength on your relationship for the consumer in the corporate side. Given your balance sheet and capital strength and some difficult headlines that we are seeing from European bank, how are you thinking in terms of your medium-term strategy to increase your market share with institutional clients, given potential market shared dislocation and your strength in capital, particularly in leverage capital? John Shrewsberry : I wouldn't think of our medium term strategy any differentially than how you've seen us behave in the recent past in that area. We have great relationships with our large number of institutional clients and counterparties and there are something interesting things to do, but we've got high regard for our capital on our funding and real meaningful expectations for how we get paid for using it as we work on those relationship. So we're already doing that from time to time something interesting will reveal itself and we'll consider it, but there is no change in strategy that it\u2019s going to result in us having a different risk profile or trying to fill our major vacuum that maybe being left behind by European bank or something else over the next few years. John Stumpf : Yes. What you would liked about us in the past you like about us in the future regarding that. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you so much. John Stumpf : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks and good morning. John Stumpf : Hi, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi. How are you? I just want to make sure that I'm fully understanding kind of what the key points of leverage are in the income statement as we look out into next year. Obviously it seems like the biggest contributor as a revenue driver is asset growth stemming in part from these acquisitions, but given sort of NIM commentary and the efficiency ratio commentary, should we expect positive operating leverage into next year or more basically zero? John Shrewsberry : Well, we are always striving to generate positive operating leverage, so that's a goal as we set out to plan for the coming period. In terms of what happens it will be \u2013 it will reflect what we're primarily emphasizing which is the growth in relationships which leads to a growth in loans and a growth in deposit, credit discipline and further penetration on all in our product areas with the customers that we have. Other macro events sit on top of that with respect to where rates go et cetera, tough to know. And we're not as focused on that or can't be as focused on that, because we can't control some of those outcomes. So we're setting ourselves up to have expense discipline. We're setting ourselves up to add relationships. We're setting ourselves up to deliver into those relationships which you see in loans deposits and many of our product areas, but how it lands in a given quarter is more difficult to forecast. John Stumpf : Eric, we're enjoying some of the strongest growth years we have seen and what we describe as the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, relationship, loans, deposits, depths of relationship, new primary checking household growth. And as John mentioned depending on the macro environment not all that shows up in that value creation the next quarter, but over the long period or even the interim period that is \u2013 the best way we think to successfully grow and add to the things that are customers and our shareholders value. Eric Wasserstrom : No, certainly. So it sounds like than its basically top line led operating leverage stemming in part from continued shift in mix of revenue sources, is that fair? John Shrewsberry : Well, we surely want the top line, but we're watching the expenses were nothing goes on examined around here and we'll see how things turn out. Eric Wasserstrom : And if I can just do one quick follow-up on asset quality, it sounds like from your commentary the go forward expectation should be for provision to roughly equal NCOs, is that right? John Shrewsberry : So, it's up to forecast. We've gone through five years of reserve releasing. We've been saying for a few quarters that what's going to happened, subsequently it's going to reflect loan growth, portfolio performance and general economic outcomes. Does that mean that we remain at a no release, no provision level? That's too precise to forecast. But it should, if we grow our portfolio and the new assets look like the assets that we already have that we'll begin providing for those which could become more of net outcome as we're already had a generational low in terms of charge-offs which means that credit performance can't really improve meaningful from where we are today. It's already that good. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thanks very much. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. John Shrewsberry : Good morning. Scott Siefers : John, I was hoping you could talk for a moment on some of the changes in the loan yields within the commercial buckets. A few of them like commercial mortgage, construction, leasing, they came under a little more pressure than I would have thought. I imagine at least to a certain extent that's due to both the financing on the GE deals, but was curious to get your color and thoughts on what might be going on there? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So I wouldn't think of that as attributable to those assets coming on. It really has more to do with the variable sources that loan fees that sometimes accelerate that run through their PCI recoveries or other things that are more \u2013 that are harder to forecast in more one time, so you see them changing these two yields and these two dates side by side, but its not a general change in the inherent yield or the customer yield on the portfolio. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then just one sort of nitpicky question. Did you guys quantify anywhere the size of the gain from the Warranty Solutions business? I think when you announce it sold it for $150 million in cash, but I wasn't sure where it had been recorded on the books? John Shrewsberry : Yes. It's less than a penny per share. I don't think that we did put that anywhere but you're the first person to ask it, so there you go. Scott Siefers : All right. Okay. I think that\u2019s' \u2013 I'm all set. Thank you very much. John Shrewsberry : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. David Hilder : Good morning. Thank you. I noticed what appeared to be reversal of prior deferred comp expenses and wondered what the reason for that was? John Shrewsberry : I don't think if it is a reversal, but every quarter our employee benefit expense on the one hand and our trading results on the other hand reflect the outcomes from our deferred comp approach. Our employees voluntarily defer comp and we neutralize the outcomes for them and we provide that return and we do it on a hedged basis, so that our results reflect. When our equity markets go up, our trading line goes up and our employ benefit expense goes up. When equity markets move down not just to generalize, the reverse is true. In this quarter we had equity markets down. We had trading revenue down and we had an equal amount of employee benefit expense down. So it's really just the cyclical ebbs and flows of that program. There's no change in approach or reversal of anything. David Hilder : Great. Thanks very much. John Shrewsberry : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning guys. How are you? John Shrewsberry : Good morning. John Stumpf : Nancy, good morning. Nancy Bush : Two questions for you. John, when you did the initial GE portfolio acquisition I guess that was couple of quarters ago, you said that you were going to continue to look at assets at GE and obviously you did. I guess my question is GE going to continue to be keeps on giving, I mean, is there more there that you're looking at or is this sort of the end of the GE pot? John Shrewsberry : So, you may have seen the list in the paper today of the 13 announcements that they've had since they declared that they were going to wind down GE capital and three of those line items are attributable to our activity, the commercial real estate, the railcar and now the commercial businesses. And we just incidentally we look very closely at many of the other things that look like they might have a fit for Wells Fargo and for one reason or another they were a better fit for somebody else either because of the asset type or the pricing scenario or something else. I think this pretty much concludes their U.S. business, I think they've got some things to sell around the world and because of our U.S. centric approach its probably true that we're not \u2013we wouldn't be playing a role like the role that we played in these three on those future acquisitions. Now having said that, we've been advisor in some of these other transactions, we've been a lender to a winning bidder in some of these other transactions. There maybe other things to do. But in the way we've approach these three businesses that were of these three portfolios that we're acquiring. I don't think there is more of that coming from GE capital. Nancy Bush : My second question would be whether the integration of this latest large business from GE is basically going to preclude you from looking at other possible asset portfolios et cetera at other companies due to the funding issues? John Stumpf : Yes, Nancy, I would answer it this way, never is a really definitive word, but I'd say on the other hand the focus right here now is to do this and do it really well. This is a lot to say grace over. We have lots of experiences in acquisitions. We're going to treat this as a merger, doing it well provide huge benefits to all those involved and that's job 1, job 2 and job 3 right now I do this really well. Nancy Bush : IF you guys could just clarify I mean you're going \u2013 are you going to be moving people, how is this physically going to work? John Shrewsberry : These businesses are primarily headquartered in the Chicago area and the Dallas area and nothing about that is intent to change. So there maybe some opportunity to -- for their people in the field to team up with our people in the field, but the bulk of the people will remain, doing what they're doing, right where they're doing and we'll figure out how to help, how to improve, how to optimize but not a big migration. Yes, we have real estate and locations and people on the Wells side in both those locations, so\u2026 Nancy Bush : Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Nancy. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. John Shrewsberry : Hey, John. John Pancari : Back to the loan yield topic, just based on your answer there is it -- are you implying that that commercial yield decline of 15 basis points that we saw this quarter could actually snap back next quarter? John Shrewsberry : No it depends on what happens with resolutions, with prepayments that accelerate loan fees into yield etcetera, so it could. I'd say as a general matter based on where we are in the cycle there are fewer resolutions, fewer PCI windups today and I wouldn't expect. We're not making bad loans anymore, so we're buying them for that matter in quite that way. So I would expect that type of accounting to quiet down and more reflect the amortization of loan fees into yield, and then of course the acceleration of those when loans prepay. We are in the higher commercial loan prepayment environment probably just because things are so liquid. But I wouldn't expect it to snapback, but it certainly could increase a little bit, move around etcetera. John Pancari : Okay. And then one other thing on the margin, the swaps, I just want to get an idea of how much the swaps benefited the margin in the quarter and then also your appetite to add incremental swaps? John Stumpf : So, we don't break out what the swaps benefit is to the margin as we have described, our approach to adding duration to the balance sheet for everyone's benefit, a portion of that\u2019s been done by swapping floating rate loans defect which has very similar impact to adding fixed rate securities to the portfolio. We don't anticipate a lot more of that activity. Today, I mentioned in response to one of the earlier questions that we think we are about where we need to be from an asset sensitivity perspective that could change its deposit flows, ebb and flow and we could end up with a lot of more liquidity to deploy, but at the moment, I think, we're \u2013 we like where we are from an asset sensitivity point of view and so we probably won't be moving rapidly down the path toward meaningfully growing the securities portfolio today or for swapping, more floating rate loans. John Pancari : Okay. And then lastly just on the credit side, on energy just want to see if you are in a position to quantify your energy reserve right at this point and then also your criticized ratio in energy lending? John Stumpf : We don't breakout the components of the allowance. But I can tell you that our approach through the first and second redetermination dates since the price of crude moved down meaningfully has been from my observation a conservative approach. We're re-rating credits down before waiting for information from borrowers based on what we know about relationship and trying to get ahead of this. So, well frankly as I mentioned in the services space we could continue to see more negative migration or even some meaningful negative migration in the industry. We feel great about where we are from allowance perspective in the energy space where we stand today. But we don't break out the component pieces of the allowances. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks. One more very quick one on that topic. The AFS portfolio with oil and gas bonds, I think you indicated a couple quarters back that it was around $1.5 billion. Is it still around that amount? John Shrewsberry : I don't have the total in front of me, but I can tell you which is part of your question, actually 1.4 is the number. We took some OTTI in the quarter in that space. Those are of the corporate names in that portfolio, energy names were the ones that were most under water for the longest period of time which certainly a part of our review for other than temporary impairment and in the quarter in our results reflects taking those impairments through the P&L. So we feel good about our bases in those assets. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead. Paul Miller : Yes, thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered. But on the jumbo loan market, it's one of the areas I think if you're not number one, I think you are number one, but we're seeing more and more market share go to the jumbo markets. Can you add more color around that? And then in the loans that you put in your portfolio my guess is most of them are jumbos. And where do you feel that you're going to be filled up there? John Stumpf : So the loans that we put up as single family mortgage loans that we put on our balance sheet, virtually all of them are prime jumbo loans because as you know there is no secondary market for those loans, so to serve those customers we end up keeping them. John Shrewsberry : You know frankly we \u2013 there is no magical numbers in terms of when we are full. Our total single family real estate portfolio hasn\u2019t shrunk or grown in the aggregate over the last few years meaningfully, the level stayed about the same, but we\u2019ve have home equity paying off. We've had pick-a-pay paying off, we\u2019ve had other lower quality loans winding down and prime jumbo loans winding up a little bit. And I guess I would anticipate that to continue as jobs are stronger and housing is stronger there are more people looking at those types of homes requiring those types of loans and only a balance sheet lender can provide that loan because there\u2019s no place in size for a mortgage company or any place else to go. There is no government program and there is no private label market. John Stumpf : I\u2019d also add this, Paul that, as a percentage even though the overall real estate, present real estate totals have not changed, the quality has improved significantly and while the totals were the same since we\u2019ve grown our loans the percentage of those loans as a percentage of our overall portfolio, loan portfolio is down and those jumbos also tend to have a bit \u2013 they tend to turn over a bit because they have a little less duration because those folks tend to move more often and so forth. So, and these are for our very best customers and it\u2019s \u2013 and we are \u2013 we should be like that asset class. Paul Miller : Okay, guys. Thank you very much. John Shrewsberry : Thank you very much. John Stumpf : Thank you. This concludes the call. Thank you all for joining us. We always appreciate your interest and involvement and again for all the questioners. We will see you here three months from now; it will be 2016 reflecting our fourth quarter earnings. So thank you very much. Bye, bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. And you may now disconnect.",

Our strong performance in 2015 reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and our focus on the real economy. Our contribution to the real economy in 2015 was broad-based and included originating $213 billion in residential mortgage loans, $31 billion of auto loans, almost in $19 billion in new loan commitments to our small business customers who primarily have less than $20 million in annual revenue, $34 billion of middle market loans and $29 billion of commercial real estate loans. We're active in facilitating the payments that drive economic activity across the country, with over $280 billion of debit card purchase volume, $70 billion of consumer credit card purchase volume and $25 billion of commercial card spend volume in 2015. We also contribute to the communities we serve in many other ways that are not directly reflected in our financial results, but are just as important to our success. For example, we've had the nation's number one United Way campaign for six consecutive years. Let me highlight a few of our other accomplishments during the past year. We generated earnings of $23 billion and earnings per share of $4.15. We grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profit. Our financial strength and competitive position have enabled us to capture opportunities for loan growth organically and through acquisitions, with average loans up $51 billion from a year ago, a 6% increase. Our deposit franchise once again, generated strong customer and balance growth with average deposits up $80 billion or 7% from a year ago and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5.6%. Our credit results continued to be very strong, with our net charge-off rate declining to 33 basis points for the year. However, since we did not have any reserve release in the second half of the year, our provision expense increased $1 billion compared with a year ago. Our capital levels increased, even as we returned more capital to shareholders, our fifth consecutive year of increased returns. We returned $12.6 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in 2015. Turning to the economic environment, while parts of the global economy have continued to experience stress and the markets have reacted negatively in the early weeks of 2016, domestic economic conditions remain generally favorable. As you know, Wells Fargo is a U.S.-centric company and the strength and diversity of the U.S. economy benefited our results in 2015. The economy continues to advance with strong job creation, including 70 consecutive months of gains in private payrolls, the longest run ever recorded. While falling energy prices have hurt certain sectors of the U.S. economy, most consumers and many businesses are benefiting from lower power costs which results in more discretionary cash that can be used for other purposes. Auto vehicle sales were the best ever in 2015 and Wells Fargo originated a record number of auto loans during the year. If gas prices continue to remain low, 2016 should be another strong year for the auto market. The housing market also continued its steady improvement, with price appreciation of 6% helping homeowners build equity and improving the credit quality of our consumer real estate portfolio where net charge-offs were down 44% from a year ago. While December housing data is not yet available, 2015 appears to be the best year for home sales and housing starts since 2007. Inventories of homes for sale remain historically low, providing a tailwind for building activity into 2016. Commercial real estate appreciation has been even stronger than consumer real estate and vacancy rates for nearly all property types continue to decline. For apartments, vacancy rates are at historic lows which should benefit both construction activity and pricing in 2016. Finally, the building blocks of our long term growth, increasing our customer base, deepening relationships and growing loans and deposits continue to be the foundation of our success. I am excited about opportunities to continue to build on these growth drivers in the year ahead, as our team members remain focused on satisfying all of our customer's financial needs. John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, will now provide more details on our results. John? John Shrewsberry : Thank you, John and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement, starting on page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. We had another quarter of solid results. While our fourth quarter earnings were the same as a year ago, the fourth quarter of 2014 had the benefit of a credit reserve release and the gain from the sale of our government guaranteed student loan portfolio, our results this quarter demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with a year ago, we continued to have strong loan and deposit growth throughout our diversified commercial and consumer businesses. We grew revenue and pretax pre-provision profit. We had positive operating leverage as our expenses declined. Credit quality remained strong, with net charge-offs of 36 basis points of average loans and we continued to have strong liquidity and capital levels. Now let me highlight these key drivers in more detail. On page 3, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including growing revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans, deposits and earnings per share. These results are even more impressive when you consider some of the headwinds we faced in 2015, while we continued to invest in our business. For example, loan loss reserve releases declined from $1.6 billion in 2014 to $450 million in 2015. The sustained low rate environment and our disciplined redeployment of our strong deposit growth reduced our margin by 12 basis points. We continued to invest in risk management related activities and these expenses were up 12% compared with 2014. We strengthened our balance sheet with increased liquidity and capital levels. Turning to page 4, we grew earning assets 3% from third quarter with loans, short term investments and investment securities all increasing. Our funding sources increased with continued deposit growth and increased long term debt and short term borrowings. Long term debt increased $14.3 billion with $17.8 billion of issuances, including debt related to funding the previously announced GE Capital acquisitions. The debt we issued during the quarter had a weighted average maturity of about eight years, at a cost of approximately three-month LIBOR plus 70 basis points. However, $10.5 billion of these issuances have a shorter maturity and become eligible for prepayment during the first half of 2016. By beginning to pre-fund the GE Capital acquisitions, we were able to maintain our strong liquidity position and our healthy level of dry powder to fund prospective balance sheet growth, while retaining the flexibility to pre-pay a significant portion of the debt should we determine it is no longer needed. Turning to the income statement overview on page 5, revenue declined $289 million from third quarter, as growth in net interest income was offset by lower non-interest income primarily due to the higher level of equity investment gains in the third quarter. As shown on page 6, we had continued strong broad-based loan growth in the fourth quarter. We've now achieved year-over-year loan growth for 18 consecutive quarters. Our core loan portfolio grew by $62.8 billion or 8% from a year ago and was up $15.4 billion from the third quarter. Commercial loans grew $9.3 billion and consumer loans grew $6.1 billion from the third quarter. We did not acquire any loan portfolios in the fourth quarter, so the linked quarter growth was all organic. The GE Capital transactions that we announced last quarter will start to be reflected in our first quarter results. The GE Railcar Services transaction with $4.1 billion of loans and leases closed on January 1, making us the largest railcar operating lessor in North America. We anticipate the North American-based portion, about 90% of the approximately $31 billion of assets we expect to acquire from GE Capital, to close late in the first quarter, with the remainder expected to close in the second quarter. We're looking forward to having many talented and experienced people from these businesses join our team. Page 20 in the appendix has additional updates on these transactions. On page 7, we highlight the diversity of our loan growth. C&I loans were up $28.1 billion or 10% from a year ago. The growth was diversified across our wholesale businesses with double-digit growth in commercial real estate, asset-backed finance, corporate banking, equipment finance, structured real estate and government and institutional banking. Core 1-4 family first mortgage loans grew $15.9 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality nonconforming mortgage loans. Commercial real estate loans grew $13.6 billion or 10% from a year ago and included the second quarter GE Capital acquisition in organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.2 billion or 80% from last year. We continued to benefit from a strong auto market, while we remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $3.3 billion or 9% from a year ago, with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans. Credit card balances were up $2.9 billion or 9% from a year ago, benefiting from new account growth and strong growth in active accounts as we experienced better activation rates on new accounts and more active users among our existing customers. As highlighted on page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67 billion or 6% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 8 basis points, down 1 basis point from a year ago and stable with third quarter. We've stated that we believe deposit betas will be lower at least initially during this rate cycle and -- lower than they have been in past periods of rising rates. Indications since the rate move in December support this. However, we continue to monitor the market to ensure we remain competitive for our customers, while maintaining our disciplined relationship-based pricing strategy. This relationship focus has resulted in strong primary customer growth, with the primary consumer checking customers up 5.6% from a year ago and our primary small business and business banking checking customers up 4.8% Primary customers are over twice as profitable as non-primary customers. Page 9 highlights Wells Fargo's revenue diversification and the balance between spread and fee income. Over the past year as we benefited from balance sheet growth, we've been able to grow net interest income by 4% while noninterest income has been relatively stable compared with a year ago. As a result, net interest income generated just over half of our revenue in the fourth quarter. We grew net interest income $408 million from a year ago, even as the net interest margin declined 12 basis points. The $131 million increase in net interest income from third quarter reflected growth in earning assets and higher income from variable sources including periodic dividends, loan recoveries and fees. Net interest income also benefited modestly from the increase in interest rates late in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by reduced income from seasonally lower balances of mortgages held-for-sale and increased interest expense from higher debt balances. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the third quarter. Income from variable sources improved the margin by 2 basis points, but was offset by customer-driven deposit growth which reduce the margin by 3 basis points, with a minimal impact on net interest income. All other repricing growth and mix reduced the margin by another 3 basis points, driven largely by increased debt balances including the funding related to the GE Capital transactions that I mentioned earlier on the call. We demonstrated our ability to grow net interest income which was up 4% from a year ago through balance sheet growth, even in the challenging rate environment during 2015. On a full-year basis, we believe we can increase net interest income in 2016 compared with 2015, in part due to the December rate increase and also from anticipated balance sheet growth. If there are additional rate increases during 2016, we would expect our net interest income growth for 2016 to be higher than the 4% growth rate we achieved in 2015. Total noninterest income declined $420 million from third quarter, primarily driven by lower equity gains. Gains from equity investments were $423 million in the fourth quarter which were in line with the quarterly average over the past two years. Equity gains declined 6% in full year 2015, compared with 2014. And considering the current market conditions in our pipeline, we would expect continued declines in 2016. The volatile markets we've had so far this year could also impact our results in capital markets related businesses, including investment banking and trading and may also affect the asset-based valuations and transaction volumes in our market-driven businesses including retail, brokerage, asset management and trust. We had linked quarter growth in a number of our businesses including investment banking, card fees, commercial real estate brokerage and mortgage banking. Mortgage banking revenue increased $71 million from third quarter. Origination volume of $47 billion was down 15% from third quarter, reflecting the expected seasonal slowdown in the purchase market, but was up 7% from a year ago benefiting from a stronger housing market. We ended the quarter with a $29 billion application pipeline, down 15% from third quarter, but up 12% from a year ago. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 183 basis points in the fourth quarter, down from 188 basis points in the third quarter. Mortgage origination revenue in the fourth quarter benefited from $128 million repurchase reserve release, as we resolved certain exposures and revised liability assumptions. Higher mortgage origination revenue also reflected stronger multi-family mortgage activity in the fourth quarter. Other income declined $214 million from third quarter, driven by the impact of higher period end interest rates on our debt hedging results and the sale of Warranty Solutions last quarter which benefited third quarter income. There are also a few linked quarter changes in some fee categories that were not driven by business activity. Merchant processing fees as reported declined $182 million linked quarter. These fees are now reported in other income as a result of an accounting change which was P&L neutral. The increase in gains from trading activities this quarter was due to higher deferred compensation gains which are offset in employee benefits and are also P&L neutral. As shown on page 12, expenses were stable with the third quarter and we remain focused on expense management. There are a few items to highlight that impacted the linked quarter trend in some specific categories. The increase in employee benefits expense reflected $319 million of higher deferred comp expense which was primarily offset in trading revenue. Operating losses were down $191 million from third quarter from lower litigation accruals, while foreclosed asset expense declined $89 million due to commercial real estate recoveries. Also third quarter expenses included a $126 million contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. A number of our expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. Equipment expense was up $181 million, primarily due to annual software license renewals. Outside professional services increased $164 million which included higher project-related spending. Advertising expenses were also elevated up $49 million. While these typically higher fourth quarter expenses should be lower next quarter, as usual, we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense. Our efficiency ratio was 57.8% for the full year 2015 and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016. Turning to our business segments, starting on page 13, community banking earned $3.3 billion in the fourth quarter, down 1% from a year ago and down 7% from third quarter. We continue to grow the number of retail bank households we serve and we're focused on building lifelong relationships with our customers by providing them with exceptional customer service. In fact, we were ranked number one in customer satisfaction in the national bank category according to the 2015 American Customer Satisfaction Index. We're growing our credit and debit card businesses through new customer growth and increased usage among existing customers. Debit card purchase volume was $73 billion in the fourth quarter, up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase volume was $18.9 billion, up 12% from a year ago. Our credit card penetration of retail banking households increased to 43.4% in the fourth quarter, up from 41.5% a year ago. We received the highest ranking in Corporate Insight assessment of credit card issuer rewards redemption options and just this week, we launched a new Propel American Express card with no annual fee. Our customers are also increasingly using our digital offerings, with active online customers up 7% and active mobile customers up 14% from a year ago. To better support our customers as they grow their companies, we've moved business banking and merchant payment services which were previously included within community banking to wholesale banking. For comparative purposes, prior periods segment results have been revised to reflect this realignment. Wholesale banking earned $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, stable from a year ago and up 9% from third quarter. The linked quarter growth reflected higher net interest and noninterest income. The increase in fee income was driven by investment banking and gains from the sale of equity fund investments driven by Volker, as well as commercial real estate related businesses such as Eastdil Secured, our commercial real estate brokerage and advisory business, Multifamily Capital and structured real estate. Revenue also benefited from continued balance sheet growth, with average loans up 13% from a year ago, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposits grew 6% from a year ago. We remain disciplined in our deposit pricing for our wholesale customers and we're focused on relationship-based pricing for both deposits and loans. Wealth and investment management earned $595 million in the fourth quarter, up 15% from a year ago and down 2% from third quarter. Growth from a year ago was driven by a positive operating leverage, with expenses down 2% and revenue up 1%. Revenue reflected strong balance sheet growth, with net interest income up 15% from a year ago. Average deposits grew 7% from a year ago and average loans grew 15%, the 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Loan growth was broad-based, with strong client demand across a number of product offerings, including high-quality nonconforming mortgage loans, commercial loans and securities-based lending. Retail brokerage managed account assets were up 3% from third quarter and down 1% from a year ago. The decline from a year ago reflected lower market valuations which were partially offset by positive flows. Turning to page 16, credit quality remains strong, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified portfolio. Our net charge-off rate was 36 basis points of average loans. Net charge-offs increased $128 million from third quarter, reflecting $90 million of higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio which totaled $118 million in the fourth quarter and seasonally higher consumer losses. The performance of our consumer real estate portfolios which are 36% of our loans outstanding continue to benefit from the improving housing market. Nonperforming assets have declined for 13 consecutive quarters and were down $497 million from third quarter, driven by improvements in our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios and a $342 million reduction in foreclosed assets. Oil and gas non-accruals were $843 million, up $277 million from third quarter. However, as of yearend, over 90% of our nonaccrual oil and gas loans were current on interest payments. We didn't have a reserve release or build in the fourth quarter, as the improvement in our residential real estate portfolios was offset by higher commercial reserves, reflecting the impact from our oil and gas portfolio. Total loans in our oil and gas portfolio were down 6% from a year ago and are now less than 2% of total loans outstanding.  We continue to work closely with our customers and are monitoring market conditions and we have reset borrowing base determinations twice since energy prices started to decline in late 2014. However, as we've mentioned in the past, it takes time for losses to emerge and at current price levels, we would expect to have a higher oil and gas losses in 2016. We've considered the challenges within the energy sector in our allowance process throughout 2015 and approximately $1.2 billion of the allowance was allocated to our oil and gas portfolio. It's important to note that the entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. We've also consider the impact of lower energy prices on our debt and equity securities portfolio and had approximately $130 million of OTTI-related write-downs in our energy-related holdings in the quarter. Turning to page 17, our capital levels remained strong, with our estimated Common Equity Tier I ratio fully phased in at 10.7% in the fourth quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers in our internal -- and buffers -- regulatory and minimum in buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us well for the acquisitions we announced in 2015 and for returning more capital to shareholders. We returned $3.2 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases and our net payout ratio was 59%. In summary, our fourth quarter and full-year results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, with strong growth in loans and deposits and consistent earnings. We continued to invest in our businesses, grew capital and liquidity and maintained a strong risk culture. We're excited about the opportunities ahead and expect our customer base to grow both organically and through acquisitions, including from the customers and platforms we're acquiring from GE Capital in 2016. We remain focused on satisfying our new and existing customer's financial needs. John and I will now answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: If we could just circle back on some of the energy comments, maybe get the exact underlying balances. You said, first on the energy loans, less than 2% of your total loan book. If you have that exact number? And then, same thing, in terms of some of the fixed income and equity exposure, just to have a sense of the gross energy risk in those three buckets? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So I would use $17 billion as outstandings for energy loans. And for securities, call it $2.5 billion which is the sum of AFS securities and nonmarketable securities. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just remind us on the lending side, the mix of investment grade versus non-investment grade or unrated? John Shrewsberry : Yes. I would -- of the $17 billion -- actually the first cut I would give you is upstream, midstream services, because I think that's germane. And I'd tell you that's about one-half upstream and one quarter services and one quarter midstream. And I think for that cut, we've separated out our investment grade component. So that what we're focused on are really the -- call it the BB and down, middle market, private clients. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And I'm sorry, of the $17 billion, how much of that piece that you are focused on? John Shrewsberry : Well, we're focused on the whole thing. Half of those customers -- one-half of those balances represent E&P companies, upstream companies. One quarter of them represent oilfield services companies and one quarter of them represent pipelines and storage and other midstream activity. And it excludes, what I would describe as investment grade -- diversified, the larger cap companies where we don't view their credit exposure as quite the same. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And is this more-- John Shrewsberry : Not much of that to begin with. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just more broadly speaking, I mean, obviously is a very balanced loan portfolio and as you mentioned, consumer-heavy if anything. But any thoughts on how much more improvement there is still to come on the consumer side? And assuming maybe the macro either holds or just has a soft patch overall, is there still some embedded improvement that we could see, I guess, really in the real estate portfolios, on the consumer side? John Shrewsberry : Well, I mean, our outlook for housing in 2016 is actually pretty strong. We've got a little bit more supply coming in. You've got more household formation. We're going to have a four handle on unemployment before you know it and we've got low rates. So if that continues to be true, that's probably a continued tailwind, in terms of some of the drivers of the estimation of embedded loss on the consumer real estate side of the loan portfolio. And without putting a number on it, because you only know it when you get there, I think that's supportive. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Just a follow-up on the energy question, you indicated during the prepared remarks that over 90% of the portfolio is current and that you've reset two times. But if prices stay where they are today, you'd have higher losses in 2016. I just wanted to understand, maybe give us a sense of -- as oil price comes down here, what kind of rate of change we should be expecting, as we're building out the model in 2016 for provisions? John Shrewsberry : Can I make one correction to your set up there which is-- Betsy Graseck : Yes. John Shrewsberry : Over 90% of nonperforming oil and gas loans are performing. All of the other ones are performing. In terms of rate of change, when we think about the allowance that we have today, frankly, we could imagine prices not improving from where they are today. And so, the rate of change of how loans actually move to loss, reflects a lot of things and it's not just price. And we just described for Matt, the distribution of upstream, midstream services and each of them behave differently. We've got customers that are oil or gas heavy, depending on what their business model. It looks a little bit different, basin by basin around the country and by method of extraction as well. So there's a lot more to what losses are going to look like in 2016 than just the spot price or the expected near forward price of crude. Having said that, we've sensitized it such that we're sitting here at -- in the $30 area a year from now and believe that our allowance accurately or appropriately reflects the loss content that we may have. John Stumpf : And Betsy, just to add, we have some of the most skilled people, 250 or so folks who have been in this industry a long time, have seen changes and we're big time focused on this. But as Matt just asked a few minutes ago, we also should step back and look at the entire portfolio. And when you have 36% of your loans as John mentioned in residential real estate, a small improvements there is huge for this company. All portfolios are important, but I just want to make sure we look at this in perspective. Betsy Graseck : Right, absolutely. I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about that reserve, because roughly 7%, it's one of the higher ones we've heard of. So I'm expecting that you are not just using the forward curve on oil to set your reserving levels. John Shrewsberry : That's correct. We're using the idiosyncratic, customer by customer circumstances, including the things that I mentioned. And their individual leverage activity, what's going on customer by customer. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Because, I mean, the question has been, as the oil price goes down and then you get closer extraction costs and your reserves go negative. How do you deal with that kind of environment? And I'm just wondering how much of that you've already priced into the reserve that you've got? John Shrewsberry : We think it's appropriate for the risk that we have embedded in the portfolio, the prices that we're living with today and can imagine into the future and as I've said, the sum of the circumstances of each one of our borrowers. And when you add it up, it's a little -- it would appear to be a little bit heavier than some of the others who have reported. John Stumpf : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : On the energy side again, just do you have the criticized energy ratio for that portfolio? And then, separately, just getting to that sensitivity question, if we did see oil pull into the $20s and stay there, $20 to $25 range, can you give us just an idea of how, the magnitude of the increase and the loss migration under that scenario? John Shrewsberry : Sure. So criticized assets today or at the end of the quarter in that portfolio are about 38% of outstandings. And there isn't a simple way to dimension what the change would be in losses, based on some other future price income. As I mentioned to Betsy, we're sensitizing our portfolio based on a continuation of very, very, very low oil prices, the context of where we're today, rather than an upward sloping curve, in addition to scenarios that include an upward sloping curve and we're comfortable with the amount of coverage that we have today. That's how I'd think about it. John Pancari : Yes. Okay. All right, and then separately, on the spread revenue side, you indicated that net interest income should grow -- it could exceed the 4% growth that you saw in 2015, if you get hikes. How many hikes are you assuming and how much greater than the 4% could it be? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So we've got a one hike, two hike, three hike and four hike scenario that we're operating with, because like you, we can't say for sure what's going to happen. We've done a -- we worked very hard to produce the type of net interest income growth that we have in a no hike environment for the last several years. So we'll see what the future holds, because it feels a little bit different every day. But if we got three or four hikes, could we end up in mid to high single-digit percentage growth rates for net interest income? That math would pencil out. But it's going to be a function of organic loan growth, closing on our GE portfolios that we've been talking about and then the number of hikes that come and when they come. John Pancari : Okay. Then lastly, what would that mean in terms of the margin outlook, if you do get -- under those hike scenarios with-- John Shrewsberry : Yes, well, it begins to expand. Another way of thinking about it is, I wouldn't expect it to begin to expand, until continued hikes begin to layer in. Particularly as we've said, while we're -- we've pre-funded a little bit of debt, so that we're in a great position to close on these assets that we're acquiring. So that's a little bit of a margin headwind. That has to -- those loans have to hit the books, so that that burns off. And then, we need to have -- first, a 25 basis point move, while important and symbolic, doesn't really do much. Even though we've been very slow to react or appropriately slow to react, in terms of our own deposit pricing activity, it's the subsequent ones that would have a meaningful impact on margin. And having said all that, what we're really focused on is growing dollars of net interest income and the balance sheet structural issues, as we have rapid deposit growth or funding activity, etcetera, have an impact on the margin, but it's about dollars for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : On the efficiency guide for full-year 2016 at the upper end of your 55% to 59% range, you noted that for the full year 2015, you were at 57.8%. And I'm wondering if you could walk us through the puts and takes, in terms of operating leverage staying flat? And also to follow up with John's question, how many interest rate hikes is that upper end of the 55% to 59% range on efficiency embed? John Shrewsberry : So in terms of puts and takes and 2015 versus 2016, we're still in an elevated time for what I would describe as compliance risk management, technology including cyber-related spend. We're still in an elevated time of product development and sort of offensive related spend. And so, I think that that's part of what guides us to this higher end for the time being. One notable difference in 2016 versus 2015, I'm not sure if anybody else has focused on this in their calls, but we also have this new incremental FDIC insurance surcharge, every bank over $10 billion in assets. And that's worth $480 million pre-tax to Wells Fargo for its partial year impact in 2016. So we're all going to have something like that for the next year or two, while that works its way through. So I would think about that. And that begins I think in Q2 of 2016. And then, if it's enacted in its current form which it's anticipated to be. So if we have two or three moves in 2016 by the Fed and if they happen ratably throughout the course of the year, that incremental revenue will have a beneficial impact on efficiency ratio. But it -- I don't know that it drives us below the middle of the range. So I think the range is still appropriate. We'll probably focus more on that and the other targets that we give you in our May Investor Day. There's a little bit of time between now and then to really set the course for the next couple of years, that reflect the environment, that reflect the balance sheet structure that we have, that reflect our expense profile. But I still feel like it's appropriate to think about the higher end of the range, so the 57% to 59% for this year, unless it rates really, really begin to move which seems hard to imagine sitting here at this moment. John Stumpf : And Erika, how we think about expenses around here is, that we're pretty tight-fisted when it comes to making sure that the expenses, the investments we do make have shareholder benefits to them. As John mentioned, defensive, offensive, we're spending a lot of money in compliance, cyber and on the other hand, we're spending also a lot of money on items and issues and things that create convenience for customers, mobile payments and a whole bunch of other things. And we always try to take a long term view. But there's a lot of discussion that takes place about managing expenses and making sure that the investments we're making do have a long term pay off for us. Erika Najarian : And just, I heard you loud and clear, in terms of the proportion of your energy exposure relative to the consumer side. But my question on this is really on CCAR. I'm wondering, did you get enough color back from your regulators, in terms of how oil and gas losses were stressed in the 2015 CCAR and how that level is comparing to the base case right now that's embedded in your reserve? I think that the next question for investors is a worry that, while everybody seems appropriately -- could be appropriately reserved for actual, that there could be an exorbitant amount of stress applied to that portfolio in the 2016 CCAR? John Shrewsberry : It's certainly possible. We haven't gotten those instructions for that specific scenario analysis yet. Separately, it won't surprise you that we're very transparent, spend a lot of time talking with the regulatory community about what's going on in energy. They are fully aware of how our portfolio works. But as you mentioned, at the beginning of that statement, it's important to remember that we're talking about 2% of a $920 billion loan portfolio. So they know that. We know that and the math benefits from that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : Does the decision by one of your large competitors to pass the 25 basis point increase through to their commercial depositors influence at all, how you guys view the degree to which you and others in the industry will benefit from higher rates? John Shrewsberry : So it depends. I mean, our wholesale teams -- and there are -- each of the different customer segment relationship teams provides a different set of insight onto what their competitive set is doing. There are some banks who I think, sounds like anyway, are being a little quicker to raise deposit rates. And in the wholesale space, there we're competing on -- we're competing on service, we're competing on product. We're competing on a lot of things. And at the margin, there's also the impact of price for certain balances. Some deposits are worth more than others, from a liquidity point of view. Some relationships are worth more than others. And I'd say we're very in tune with what we think we need to do to maintain relationships and to reward customers where we have a big relationship and a lot going on. John Stumpf : We've been through this before. And we try to stay really focused, Bill, on customer and providing them great value. And I think what John is saying and what we're all saying is, there is value to the entire relationship. There is value to the products we have and services and surely deposit pricing is one of those value items. But it's not a standalone item. John Shrewsberry : Yes. And one observation that I would have -- and this is very early days in this -- is that some of the feedback I've seen are the -- that the customers who seem to be the most price-sensitive on the deposits are the customers whose deposits have the lowest liquidity value to Wells Fargo. So sometimes, it's easy to see those go. Bill Carcache : Separately, if I may, I saw your recent transaction update on slide 20, but was hoping you could give a little bit more color on client retention initiatives and whether there are any issues there? And some of those acquired specialty finance businesses, like Vendor Finance for example, were pretty nichey. And it feels like it was really, Wells and GE and like the CITs of the world that really played in those areas. So just curious, whether GE's exit you think increases your ability to grow share across those businesses, as we look forward from here? John Shrewsberry : Yes. Well, we certainly hope that it does. And I'd say, that in Vendor in particular -- I think we mentioned this one we announced the deal. But as you described GE has this great business, that's close to the OEMs that helps them finance their sales to their customers. Now from a Wells Fargo perspective, most of those OEMs are already customers of Wells Fargo in one way or another and most of their customers are already -- or many of their customers are already customers of Wells Fargo in one way or another. So it's a way for us to really enrich the relationship, get closer to the manufacturer. And in some cases, expand a program that we may already have been a smaller player in and in other -- in many other cases, to create a program or to step into a program that is working well. But I'd say overall, customer reception has been great, as our leaders have reached out and traveled around with our new GE teammates and talked to the customers of the GE businesses. I don't think customer retention has not surfaced as an issue. It's just a question of how quickly and how well we can expand the product penetration, given all that Wells Fargo has to offer a wholesale customer in each of those instances. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : My question is on fees, specifically if you could start on the brokerage business. Obviously, the market values are now weighing on the underlying growth, but I was wondering if you could just give us your outlook for growth in the brokerage business which unfortunately has comped now a little negative on a year-over-year basis. But can you just kind of distinguish between market levels, impacts and what you're seeing from a customer activity perspective as you look to 2016? John Shrewsberry : Sure. I mean, it's made a little bit more complicated by what's going on -- in these couple of weeks, in terms of just with respect to the impact of asset-based fund or fee type arrangements. So it's hard to ballpark at the moment. But we have good, strong growth of inflows of both accounts and account assets. And if we were in a more normalized S&P environment, then we'd be talking about the continuity of call it, the single-digit percentage growth that has been working for us for the last few years. But when you overlay this market instability, it depends, A, on what levels we end up at, because that'll influence what we're multiplying times a fee schedule. And, B, we customers do, whether customers are -- stay invested, get more invested or back away as volatility increases. I think it's David's expectation to continue to grow the business by adding new customers, to encourage customers to stay invested, if that's appropriate for where they are in their investing life cycle, to use these as entry points for people who have more money to put to work and longer term goals. So it's going to come and go, move a little bit as equity markets move up and down. But I think what we're talking about in revenue terms, even with the type of pullback that we've had in the first quarter is call it, hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of net income sensitivity, if we weren't to recover from here and if we didn't have meaningful new customer -- new client growth over the course of the year, so. Ken Usdin : And then secondly, just on the mortgage business, if you could also just, ex the MSR drive [ph] -- which can swing big up or down, how much more retrenching do we still have of the servicing portfolio? And what's just your expectation, if it's different than just kind of the MBA, Fannie, Freddie for what you think the mortgage market does in the year ahead? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So I think the MBA is calling for a $1.5 trillion or $1.6 trillion, down to $1.4 trillion mortgage market in 2016 versus 2015 and our folks seem to be in sync with that. In terms of servicing retrenching, it's -- we'll get to a more normalized level of defaulted loan workout activity over the course of the next couple of years, as that -- the full crisis era inventory works it's way off. And then, we'll find out what the stabilized run rate is for productivity, for how many people it takes to service a portfolio of our size that's behaving more normally. And so, there is incremental benefit to take out but we're not in a hurry to do it. It's more important about the loans are serviced properly and customers are dealt with in a way that they require. But so, there's some upside there. And unreimbursed servicing costs, I'd say are -- as we look out, they start to improve quarter by quarter, over the course of the next several. So that's one benefit. But we'll see. But in terms of the market overall, we're very, very big in conforming with Fannie and Freddie and there's more to do there. We think of it more as more of a purchase market as we go forward, especially if rates increase, although they're going the other way right now. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier, some of the early indicators for purchase activity look really good, more jobs, more available housing to buy and more people moving into prime first-time home buyer and second-time homebuyer age cohorts. Those are all very supportive and so-- John Stumpf : And household formation-- John Shrewsberry : And household formation is up meaningfully. So that's good news. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : But I think that most of my questions have been answered. But maybe back on the energy portfolio, just broadly, if you guys can speak to how your -- just how you are treating customers at a top level? You don't think there's a sense that banks are not necessarily pulling back credit the way you might if you had this kind of a correction in any other sort of asset value, so just at a top level? And then, John I think you had said in your comments about the NPAs there, I just want to make sure I heard that correctly. Is it 90% of the oil and gas NPAs are current on interest only? I just want to make sure I heard that correctly as well. John Shrewsberry : Current on interest is what I said. Yes. So in terms of pullback and credit availability, I would expand the description to say, not just bank credit, but capital markets were actually, as you know, were quite open for energy companies very early in this. And that has gone away. My understanding is that smaller banks, regional banks, have only recently begun to really pull back from a willingness to provide credit. Maybe it's this incremental leg down to where we're on crude prices that has people generally believing that this could be where we're for a longer time. I wouldn't say that there is a tremendous demand for incremental credit right now. It's more about how quickly you're asking or requiring your customers to come into conformance under their borrowing base. What you're doing with their excess cash, what they're doing with their CapEx program. And I'd say, we're all being as appropriately tough, to make sure that we protect the interests of the bank. We're very -- we're working with each customer to help them work through this. It doesn't do us any good to accelerate an issue or two, to end up as the holder of a number of oil leases as a bank. And so, that dictates some of the cadence. Services companies I think are different than E&P companies, because for some of them it's really not about a $5 band of oil prices or a $10 band of oil prices. They're either in business or they're not in business. And if they're not in business, you have got to figure out how to maximize the recovery as quickly as possible, because some of their inventory which is security for the loan may be very single-purpose. And I'd say that's a little bit of a different workout. I don't know if that's helpful, but that's how we're seeing it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead. Paul Miller : On the mortgage banking side, can you talk a little bit about how TRID has impacted on the mortgage banking revenues? It looks like you guys did a pretty good quarter, despite a lot of disruptions that TRID brought to the market. John Shrewsberry : Yes. So we spent a lot of time preparing ourselves for it technology-wise, data management-wise, so that we could flip a switch and collect the right data and have the right disclosures, etcetera. We've not seen a meaningful impact to our results in our retail channel or from our work with correspondents. There are probably some lower volume programs that we or others would have deemphasized, while we emphasize preparing ourselves for the new requirements in our bigger programs. So as those -- or as those have come online, etcetera, maybe we see a little bit of a snapback, but you wouldn't even notice that in the numbers. So for the most part, the impact I'd say, has been immaterial. Paul Miller : And then, in the 2015 especially in the second half of the year we saw on the macro data and I think even on your micro data, a big pick up in purchase originations. Probably the large -- the third quarter was the largest origination quarter for purchases since 2007, 2008. Do you think TRID interrupted that? Are you still seeing very strong demand for the purchase market, despite all this volatility? John Shrewsberry : Well, you have to seasonally adjust that analysis, but I think it's our take that it didn't really interrupt it. John Stumpf : It just adds a week, Paul. It really does. And it turns out to be in many cases, a bit of an inconvenience to a customer. But it's what it is -- but I don't think it's really had an impact. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Two quick follow-ups on debt issuance, just with the GE, I just wanted to make sure that I understood, is that fully funded now or is that partially funded? Can you say how much -- how much of that is funded already? John Shrewsberry : Sure. Through the end of the year, I'd say, it's 2/3rds. John McDonald : Okay. And the expectations for earnings accretion turned a little bit more positive in your update? Has anything changed there or you've just refined your estimate from when you first did the deal? John Shrewsberry : It's the latter. It's refining the estimate of the expenses that we're going to consume to properly transition all the team members, to do data work around the customers, etcetera. Although it's just important to say, the big emphasis here is on the lifetime relationship we're going to have these customers. I know that it's important to you guys to get what the first few months mean, but we're much more concerned on an orderly transition and a nice integration and a good feeling for both customers and team members. And that's expensive. John McDonald : Okay. And then, on TLAC, any update on potential TLAC issuance? I think your original estimate was up $40 billion to $60 billion. And have you done some of that already and what will be maybe the timing or time frame over which you do the rest? John Shrewsberry : So the estimate is still the same. We did do a little bit in the fourth quarter, $6 billion to $7 billion I think in the fourth quarter of what would be TLAC eligible. This is a little bit of a subtlety, but now that the NPR is out and while the NPR is out, there is a little ambiguity about what's eligible and what's not. And so, that will slowdown issuance during the NPR period, so that none of us issue something that turns out not to be either conforming or grandfathered. So it'll be slow here for a quarter or two probably, but it's our goal to get our full requirement, whatever it ultimately is in place with plenty of room before the actual -- the final phase-in date of 1/1/2022. So we will update folks as we go along, to let them know where we're on that journey and what the impact is. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Morford : John, you talked about the economy, but what's customer sentiment like lately? Are you seeing much confidence to borrow and make investments and given the macro uncertainties? And also, while the consumer is benefiting from lower gas prices, are you seeing much willingness to spend? John Stumpf : So far, Joe, with respect to consumers, they have not spent a lot of their gas savings so far. I think you'll start to spend some more -- and the thing for Wells Fargo is 97% of what we do is in the U.S.. And virtually everything we do in the U.S. is involved in the real economy. And there are pockets of strengths. You think of autos, you think of commercial real estate, you think of residential real estate, parts of ag, some middle market. And I don't -- I'm not going to say it's robust, but we're really happy we're all-in in the U.S.. Let's put it that way. Joe Morford : And then, how did also how did the recruitment of the Credit Suisse private bankers go relative to expectations? And was there any impact from this on expenses this quarter and what would be the magnitude and timing of the assets under management you might expect to transfer over? John Shrewsberry : So I think it's going on -- as David would describe it, as planned, in terms of number of people who have or will be joining Wells Fargo. I don't think they've actually disclosed a hard number on that, but it's a good outcome. And I assume it'll take one to two quarters after people join for them begin to migrate their customer accounts over to Wells Fargo. That's probably more of a second half impact. And, frankly, even with the maximum number of people, the total people that were originally referred to in that arrangement that we had with Credit Suisse, what it looks like is three, four or five months' worth of organic financial advisor recruitment. It's not a huge game-changer in terms of the numbers. It's great. We've got the exact right people for our platform. They add a lot of capability. They have a lot of great customer relationships that we're excited to have. But I would think of that more as a modest acceleration of what would have been organic activity, rather than a game-changing activity in this segment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Brian Foran : So I guess, there is an industrial company reporting as you're speaking, so I don't mean to hijack you, since you obviously haven't heard of it. And I don't even know if I'm pronouncing it right, Fastenal or something, but they're kind of making the statement that we're in an industrial recession. They're seeing some of their underlying customers with orders down 25%-plus year-over-year. So I wonder if you could comment, like when you just talk to that kind of industrial component of your customer base, who maybe is a more exposed to cutbacks by the energy industry and the strong dollar, do you think it's possible we actually are in an industrial recession right now? John Shrewsberry : So my observation would be, for certainly for folks who are selling into the energy extraction or processing businesses, it's been a tough year and will continue to be. And I'd be surprised if those orders were only down 25%. But I think more broadly, at least as it reveals itself in our own customer activity, people who are more reliant on exports have been -- were hit early and hit hard by how strong the dollar has become over the course of the last couple of years. And but more broadly, it's as John described, right? It's not robust. People aren't super enthusiastic. But you've seen the growth in our commercial loan portfolios which reflects people doing business. And some -- a lot of that is us taking business from other people, but in a significant portion of those cases, that's folks borrowing money to do things, to buy things. And it doesn't feel like a manufacturing recession to me. Although, I'm sensitive to manufacturers who ship everything overseas and who are trying to sell it in dollars, because that's a more expensive proposition. John Stumpf : Yes. As John mentioned, we're a very diversified company. We lend to all sectors of the economy, farmers, ranchers, 2% of our loans in oil and gas, commercial real estate, middle market. And so, you're going to have some companies because of what they are doing are going to be impacted more than others. And I can surely see where Fastenal, who -- it's a Midwestern company, I know that company, it's a great company -- will have some issues or would be saying the things they're saying. That makes sense to me, given their product mix. Brian Foran : I thought they were based in Minnesota. So I figured it was fair to ask. John Stumpf : I know them. They're great. Brian Foran : And then, I guess, just stepping back on fees. I guess, one of the things that just strikes me looking at the model is, they have kind of been bouncing around $10 billion a quarter, ever since the Wachovia deal. And I guess, that speaks to some of the benefits of diversity in the business, because there have been some huge headwinds like the mortgage bubble popping and all that. Do you think we're finally at the point where, the underlying business momentum that you've clearly generated can start leading to higher reported consolidated fees? Or is there still maybe another year of headwinds with the lower equity markets and lower refi volumes and stuff like that? John Shrewsberry : So the bigger categories would be deposit service charges which are both consumer and commercial. And I would say there's a nice trajectory there and we were impacted in a way that call it, in the immediate post-merger time frame where things were cut back and then growing. And they have been growing nicely and continue to, both by adding new customers and adding new capability. So that's a strength and something that will continue to grow. Card fees, the big emphasis there, both debit and credit and are moving down the path to really grow our credit card business I think will help there. In the wealth and investment management business, as we've talked about, a big portion of it will be a function of what happens with equity markets. But we're growing the customer base. We're growing assets under management and that may be more volatile, given what's going on with the S&P, but that certainly a source of growth over any reasonable time frame. Those categories are our bread-and-butter, fundamental banking activity that we feel really good about. At the margin, we also have as we've mentioned, this step down to a more normalized level of equity gains. That's something that has to be grown through, in your analysis, the mortgage market as we've said, even if we're doing more, if that market isn't growing much, then we'll be impacted one way or the other by that. So it's our goal to work to grow the aggregation of those line items in the way that you're describing. But each of them has their own character. That diversification has worked for us over the past several years as you mentioned. But there is a lot to do to grow them. Brian Foran : I could sneak in a very short one on energy, is there any material second lien exposure in the oil portfolio? John Shrewsberry : Not material. No. There is a little bit in a business that we call energy capital, but in the context of the numbers that we've been talking about, it's not material. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Just a couple clarifications, so you have $1.2 billion of reserves on oil and gas credits and you have $17 billion of oil and gas credits. Is that right? John Shrewsberry : Correct, outstanding. Mike Mayo : So you have 7% reserves against your oil and gas portfolio? John Shrewsberry : The math works out to 7% on that allocation, but I'd point out that we have a $12 billion allowance for loan losses, all of which is available for losses wherever they occur in the portfolio, but yes. Our own internal allocation of what's applied to that portfolio would get you to 7%. Mike Mayo : So I think you're winning on that 7% percentage. I mean, some others are at 3%, 4%, 5%. So I guess -- but I didn't get the answer to the question before, what percent of the $17 billion are -- is non-investment grade? John Shrewsberry : I would say most of it, most of it. Mike Mayo : So most of the $17 billion is non-investment grade? John Shrewsberry : Correct. Mike Mayo : So would that 7% figure reflect that mix then of having more non-investment grade credits or would it reflect more conservatism than peers? John Shrewsberry : As I mentioned, everyone of these portfolios is different, based on who their customers are, what their business mix looks like, what basins, what extraction method, what their corporate leverage looks like. So it's hard to compare. I do agree that 7% is winning though, in terms of the reported numbers. Mike Mayo : And just to clarify what you said before, if oil stays at $30 for the next year, you still feel that the $1.2 billion of reserves on the oil and gas portfolio is sufficient? Is that correct? John Shrewsberry : Correct. Mike Mayo : Okay. And now let's just pull the lens back a little bit. John, you've been through many cycles. And I am just wondering, is the decline in the oil and gas sector similar to other industry specific declines that then spill over on the broader economy? In other words, what comes to my mind is 2002, TMT, there you had add Enron, WorldCom, you had a spillover effect. You had some market concerns, you had some losses. Or what other period does this seem similar to? Or is this stretching too much, this oil and gas thing, it's fine, it's going to blow over? Where do you stand? John Stumpf : Actually, Mike, it's a great question. I go back to 1985 or the early 1980s, when I ran the workout group. In fact, I got to see our Denver-based energy business up close at that time. So I -- and then we saw, of course, there has been a couple cycles since that time. And this one is different in a couple of respects. First of all, the economy in the U.S. is more diversified, so the communities in which energy plays a role is more diversified. Not true in every community but and we look at that. Secondly, companies this time around reacted much more quickly. I think in past recessions -- in past corrections, there was more hope and prayer going on, for higher prices or a rebound. And so, they reacted quickly. And I would also say this time around, the way companies finance themselves, there is more private equity and other debt that would be subordinate to the bank debt. So there are differences. And I would say the final thing is, the mismatch between supply and demand at the world level is fairly narrow. So there's about 93 million barrels produced a day and about 92 consumed. So it's a very narrow mismatch and demand seems to still be increasing. So I am not suggesting that's going to make this problem go away anytime soon. The Saudis are pumping like crazy. So are the Russians and of course, with what happened with tight oil here in the U.S., but there are differences. And our people who run this portfolio for us have seen many or most of those cycles. So everyone is different. John Shrewsberry : One thing I would add is, certainly plenty of opportunity for a market-related contagion when one industry is suffering and other industries are starting -- are trying to borrow. But in this instance, cheap oil is a net stimulative impact on U.S. growth. A WorldCom fraud was not beneficial for everybody else in the U.S. Telecom didn't get cheaper. But fuel has gotten cheaper which is good for consumers and good for other-- John Stumpf : And Mike, I'll give you one other example. I was with a large builder in the Texas market not long ago. And they were talking about the fact that some of what's happening in oil and gas in the field services is making cement more available and workers and so forth that are important to housing. So I'm not suggesting it happens everywhere, everyone's different. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : John, I wanted to ask you about the cross-sell ratio, something you've always prided, in the sense of being able to show improvement, kind of peaked out last year and this year, we're actually seeing it come down a little bit. So just was wondering how those trends are looking, in the sense of being able to sell more to your products? John Stumpf : Sure. So how that works is, we take total product holdings divided by total customers. And we're actually seeing the denominator grow faster now than we've seen it in some time and first-year customers don't have an average of six products. They are more in the four range, so that has a bit of a dilutive impact on that. And also, as you get to the higher value products, the sales cycle or solutions cycle tends to be a bit longer. So this is actually a good problem I think, in that when you're growing net new primary checking accounts by 5.6%, the goal is not necessarily a ratio. The goal is to have long term mutually beneficial relationships with customers where we help them succeed financially. So I'm happy with where we're in that. But thank you for the question. It's a good question. Marty Mosby : And then, on the net interest margin, can we just think about this -- let's forget about the funding cost and deposits, because everybody's skittish on committing to what's going to happen, given the dynamic of competition. But let's just think about earning assets and the floating loans and short term liquid assets that you have. With the 25 basis point rise that we saw in December, how much should we see the impact on that positive to earning asset yields, just isolating out that one piece of the equation? John Shrewsberry : So it depends on the existing and changing distribution between one-month, three-month LIBOR-based loans, prime-based loans, fixed loans, LIBOR loans that we swap to fixed rate and there's a lot that goes into it. So it's hard to isolate it. I'd say that, when we think back to the way that we separated our interest rate sensitive categories for illustrative purposes at the last Investor Day, we would have said that 20%ish and this is both asset and liability side, so it's a different answer than what you're asking -- but that we would've gotten, call it 20% of a change flowing through and the range was 10% to 30%. And I think we're probably at the low end of that range right now, but that's picking up both assets and liabilities. I can tell you also that LIBOR resets seem to have occurred the way we would've expected them after the Fed moved in December. So the asset side is behaving as we expected and a 25 basis point move is not a giant needle mover, in terms of dollars and cents for Wells Fargo. On a net basis, you're talking about $100 million to $200 million a quarter or something like that. So all things being equal which they never are, but that's the order of magnitude. Marty Mosby : And then, just lastly, was there any disruption on investment banking, from some of the things that we saw with high yield freezing up and some of the processing there, of just being able to deliver into the market, because investment banking has been a big grower, a benefit for you all as well. So just wanted to see if there was any disruptions in the quarter that you experienced in that side? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So I wouldn't describe anything as a disruption. There is sort of two ways that on the sell side that we might be impacted. One is, how do net long credit are we in our trading businesses? And I think we managed that really, really well and it wasn't really disruptive. And then, are the markets open and are we representing clients and helping them raise money in the high yield market? And that's been harder to do, given the volatility that we've seen. Our share is still about the same. We're between 4% and 5% of U.S. investment banking fees. That's capital markets activity, advisory activity, etcetera, but it didn't have a big impact. We were up in the fourth quarter over the third quarter in investment banking fees overall which you'd expect. The fourth quarter is seasonally, usually a busier time, M&A activity, etcetera, but no disruption. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Kevin Barker : You mentioned that the amount of criticized loans in your energy portfolio was 38% of outstandings. What was it last quarter? And could you also describe how many of your energy loans are either in a second lien position or subordinated position compared to first lien holders? John Shrewsberry : Sure. So criticized oil and gas assets -- I can tell you what they -- how they changed year-over-year. They're at, call it $6.6 billion at the end of the quarter, up $5.5 billion from -- so substantially, all migrated during the course of 2015. And in terms of second lien, it's a small number. We have a small business called Energy Capital that does some -- they're deeper in the capital stack investing and in our clients and in their properties. And I want to say the total portfolio is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. So it's modest. John Stumpf : Think of this is a senior lender, I mean-- John Shrewsberry : And the big E&P exposures are senior loan exposures. Kevin Barker : What was the change of criticized, from third quarter to fourth quarter I meant? John Shrewsberry : Let me see. It was 33% at the end of the third quarter and 38% at the end of the fourth quarter. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then, in regards to some of the questions earlier about ancillary effects from the decline in oil prices, could in industrial, but then for even some financial institution exposure that you had in the commercial portfolio? John Shrewsberry : So we have an ongoing analysis to look at it -- this is a related, but indirect response to that question. We have an ongoing analysis of all of the MSAs where we've got more than 5% -- well, there's two versions of it, so the 3% to 5% and then greater 5% employment in the energy industry and we're looking at all of our consumer and commercial exposures in those geographical areas to measure impact and to think about how we lend money, A, what our balance sheet exposure is and, B, what our new origination exposure looks like. And it might surprise you that places like Houston, because of their relative diversity of their overall economy are actually performing relatively stronger than some counties that represent other basins in the Dakotas, in the West, etcetera. But we really haven't seen any second order big impact yet among any of them, in terms of our balance sheet exposure and we're on the lookout. The entire credit organization here is focused on how that might change, but it really hasn't yet. And then, as John mentioned earlier, for most of our customers, 98% of our loans and most of our retail consumer customers and our wholesale customers, lower fuel costs mean lower transportation costs, mean lower heating costs, mean lower power costs. It's not bad for their business. They're impacted if their customers are employed in the business. They're impacted if they're selling into the business. But it's got a net stimulative effect. And so, we haven't seen a big spillover yet. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then, right now, your charge-off rate is running in the low to mid 30s on basis points, whereas-- John Shrewsberry : Lowest on record at Wells Fargo, 33 basis points is as low -- we've looked in the-- John Stumpf : I've been here 34 years, I've never found it, never been lower. Kevin Barker : Clearly, trends have been excellent for you guys over the last several years. And when we step back and look at, reserve releases have essentially stopped in the last two quarters. And pre-crisis, your charge-off rate was running around 70 to 80 basis points give or take, depending on the quarter and the year. But in looking at it now, how do you look at the migration or the normalization of credit where we're now versus pre-crisis? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So we'll probably talk about this in some depth at our Investor Day and there are a couple important things and one of them is the mix of the assets on our balance sheet today, compared to where it used to be. So, home equity is sort of a going away business, because we've got a portfolio that's been shrinking for a long time. It's been improving in performance and it just is not being added for a variety of reasons on a net basis and that's unlikely to change. That was a big source of our absolute dollars of loss in the weighted average charge-off rate through the -- leading up to and through the crisis. When you think about the residential real estate portfolio here, what we're adding is all high-grade -- it's prime jumbo origination. They are very safe loans. I think we've got 4 basis points of loss, something like that coming through that portfolio. It feels very good. And while I'm sure it'll change a little bit over time, it's not going to behave like balance sheet first mortgage loans did pre-crisis, because there was just a different appetite for the types of loans that banks might hold. So I think that's important. Also the percentage of our portfolio and card business, we're trying to grow the credit card business. We like it a lot. It's obviously got a much more volatile charge-off profile to it, but at $30 billion, $40 billion or even $50 billion worth of assets at Wells Fargo, it's going to have -- if you are comparing us against other banks for example, that's going to have an impact. And I think those are a couple of the -- that contribution to mix is something that you need to have a sense for. And I think what you'll hear from us when we revisit this at Investor Day, is that our current expectation for our normalized through the cycle loss rate will be lower than the last time that we talked about it. But probably higher than 33 basis points, but lower than the 75 or whatever we signaled to you two years ago. John Stumpf : And Kevin, I'll make one final comment. Virtually everything we do on the consumer side is prime. I mean, we have some near prime, 10% or so or less in auto and that's a bit of a difference from before. We had a Wells Fargo Financial in the past for example. Operator : And I will now turn the conference over for any concluding remarks. John Stumpf : Well, thank you for joining us. I want to thank all of our team members who serve one in three customers across the United States and so much appreciate all they do. Thank you for joining us and we'll see you in 90 days, three months from now. Bye, bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference. Jim Rowe : Thank you, Regina and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at Wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including the reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf. John Stumpf : Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our performance in the first quarter once again benefited from our diversified business model and our continued focus on meeting our customers\u2019 financial needs. While the persistent low rate environment, market volatility and continued weakness in the oil and gas industry provided some near term headwinds, our long-term results continued to be driven by our focus on the real economy. For example, we are the largest lender in the U.S. and our loan and deposit balances are at an all-time high.  We continued to grow our customer base both organically and through acquisitions and February was the strongest month for retail bank household growth in five years. We worked to make every relationship, new and existing, a lasting one and our focus on providing outstanding customer service was recognized with Wells Fargo ranking number one in customer loyalty among large banks in the 2016 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index conducted by the firm Brand Keys.  Let me now highlight our results in the first quarter. We generated earnings of $5.5 billion and EPS of $0.99. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4% with growth in both the net interest income and non-interest income and our pre-tax pre-provision profit grew 5%.  Average loans grew $64 billion or 7% from a year ago. Our deposit franchise once again generated strong customer and balanced growth with average deposits up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago, and we grew the number of primary consumer checking customers by 5%.  While deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove a $200 million reserve build, the rest of our loan portfolio continued to have strong credit results with our total net charge-off rate remaining near historical lows at 38 basis points annualized, reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio. Our strong capital position enabled us to acquire assets from GE Capital and we returned $3 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter. As you know, yesterday the Federal Reserve and FDIC announced their response to the 2015 resolution plan submitted by eight banks, including Wells Fargo. While we were disappointed to learn that our submission was determined to have deficiencies in certain areas, we are focused on fully addressing these issues as part of our 2016 submission.  Turning to the economic environment. While signs of economic uncertainty remain in the global economy as well as volatility in the capital markets, the U.S. economy, which is the primary driver of Wells Fargo's results, continues to be resilient. For example, while low energy prices have negatively impacted the oil and gas industry, the U.S. is still a net energy importer and the benefits of falling prices have outweighed the costs for consumers and most businesses.  Job creation in the U.S. remains robust with 2.7 million jobs added over the past year alone. Consumers have also benefited from low interest rates and modest borrowings. In fact, servicing financial obligations require just 15% of household income at the start of the year, more than a percentage point lower than the long term average and several percentage points lower than what the recession level was in late 2007.  The housing market continues to do well with steady gains in sales, construction and prices. This improvement has continued to benefit our consumer real estate portfolio where net charge-offs were down 41% from a year ago. Commercial real estate also remained strong with vacancy rates low in apartment, industrial and retail sectors and our CRE portfolio continued to generate net recoveries.  So while the start of 2016 has shown that the economic recovery remains slow and uneven, we remain focused on the long term drivers of our success, namely: increasing customers, loans, deposits and building capital. This unwavering focus on our diversified business model positions us well to benefit from future growth opportunities.  John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer will now provide more details on our first quarter results. John? John Shrewsberry : Thanks, John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on Page 2. John and I will then answer your questions. We had another quarter of solid results. We have now generated quarterly earnings of more than $5 billion for 14 consecutive quarters, one of only two companies in the country to do so, demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model and our consistent risk discipline.  While earnings declined from a year ago, our results in the first quarter last year included a discrete tax benefit of $359 million or $0.07 per share and a $100 million dollar reserve release. Our results this quarter included a number of noteworthy items. Our revenue benefited from the previously announced sale of our crop insurance business resulting in a $381 million gain recorded in all other non-interest income. All other income also included $379 million of hedge ineffectiveness primarily on our own long-term debt hedges reflecting the impact of lower rates and foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the quarter. We would expect the hedge ineffectiveness to be neutral to our results over the life of the hedge relationship but the impact in every quarter will vary.  We had a $124 million of other-than-temporary-impairment, OTTI, in our debt and equity securities related to oil and gas in the first quarter. The deterioration in the oil and gas portfolio drove the $200 million credit reserve build in the quarter also. I will get into more detail on oil and gas later in the call. Expenses included $752 million of seasonally higher employee benefit expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement-eligible team members. Our first quarter results also included the GE Capital acquisitions we completed during the quarter. On Page 4, we show the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted, including increases in revenue, pretax pre-provision profit, loans and deposits. Turning to Page 5. Let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. Investment securities declined $12.7 billion from fourth quarter as we paused most of our purchase activity due to the volatility in the bond market. We had $5 billion of gross purchases during the first quarter compared with last year's average of $26 billion per quarter.  Long-term debt increased $28.4 billion with $23.8 billion of issuances, including $11 billion raised in advance of closing the GE Capital acquisitions. We also assumed $3.6 billion of debt from previous GE Capital securitizations. Short-term investments and Fed funds sold increased $30.4 billion reflecting growth in deposits, long term debt and our disciplined approach in managing liquidity and investment securities during the quarter. Turning to the income statement overview on Page 6. Revenue increased $609 million from the fourth quarter with growth in both net interest and non-interest income. I will highlight the drivers of this growth throughout the call. As shown on Page 7, we had continued strong loan growth in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and 3% from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans grew $31.6 billion from the fourth quarter, including $24.9 billion from the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Consumer loans declined $923 million from the fourth quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto and securities-based lending and student lending was more than offset by reductions in junior lien mortgage and seasonal declines in credit card.  Our total average loan yield increased 8 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the GE Capital acquisitions as well as the benefit of floating rate loan repricing.  We added a total of $30.8 billion of loans and leases from the GE capital acquisitions. The benefit of our strong balance sheet and industry expertise enabled us to add these high quality businesses, including talented new team members and valuable customer relationships. This is our largest acquisition since 2008. The integration is on track and we continue to expect it will be modestly accretive in 2016.  We completed the GE Railcar Services acquisition on January 1, which included $918 million of loans and interest earning leases and $3.2 billion of operating leases reported in other assets. Most of the revenue from this business is reflected in non-interest income as lease income.  On March 1, we acquired the North American-based portion of GE Capital C&I loans and leases which included $24 billion of loans and interest earning leases and $2.7 billion of operating leases. The remaining $2 billion of assets is expected to close in the second half of the year. The loans and leases we acquired were marked to fair value under the purchase method of accounting so that there was no associated allowance added as a result of these transactions.  Slide 9 highlights our broad-based loan growth. C&I loans were up $50.5 billion or 19% from a year ago driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Core one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $17.3 billion or 8% from a year ago and reflected continued growth in high quality non-conforming mortgage loans.  Commercial real estate loans grew $15.8 billion or 12% from a year ago, benefiting from the second quarter GE Capital acquisition and organic growth. Auto loans were up $4.3 billion or 8% from last year. We've consistently grown this portfolio in the upper single digits over the past year, reflecting the strong auto market while we have remained disciplined in our approach to credit and pricing.  Credit card balances were up $3.1 billion or 10% from a year ago, reflecting new accounts and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.7 billion or 8% from a year ago with growth in securities based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans. As highlighted on Page 10, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the first quarter, up $44.6 billion or 4% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 10 basis points, up 1 basis point from a year ago and up 2 basis points from the fourth quarter. The slight increase in deposit cost reflected an increase in deposit pricing for some wholesale banking customers. We continue to believe that deposit betas will be lower during this rate cycle than they have been in past periods of rising rates, especially if the outlook for future rate increases remains uncertain. Page 11 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and non-interest income. We grew net interest income $79 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in earning assets, including the partial quarter impact from the assets acquired from GE Capital, the benefit from higher short-term rates and disciplined deposit pricing. These increases were partially offset by reduced income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and loan fees and one less day in the quarter.  The net interest margin declined 2 basis points from the fourth quarter with lower variable income. All other growth and repricing were essentially neutral to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the first quarter by 6% from a year ago and continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full-year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 even if there are no additional rate increases. Total non-interest income increased $530 million from fourth quarter driven by the increase in all other non-interest income that I highlighted at the start of the call. The non-interest income also benefited from the increase in lease income related to the GE Capital acquisitions we completed in the quarter, which also included related lease depreciation expense. The linked quarter increase in trading gains was due to higher customer accommodation trading results across our markets businesses. The volatile markets we experienced in the first quarter impacted our trust and investment fees which declined $126 million from the fourth quarter. We also had lower debt and equity investment gains down $281 million from the fourth quarter. While linked-quarter trends in deposit service charges and card fees were negatively impacted by seasonality, both of these fees grew 8% from a year ago driven by account growth. Mortgage banking revenue declined $62 million from the fourth quarter. Origination volume was $44 billion, down 6% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality but purchase originations were up 13% from a year ago, reflecting a stronger housing market.  Applications were up 20% from the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter with a $39 billion application pipeline, up 34% from the fourth quarter. We expect origination volume to increase in the second quarter reflecting normal seasonality and strength in the housing market. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the first quarter, down 15 basis points from the fourth quarter due to a higher mix of correspondent originations in the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability declined $107 million from fourth quarter, which also contributed to lower production revenue. Servicing income increased $120 million from fourth quarter, from higher net MSR servicing hedge results and lower unreimbursed servicing costs.  As shown on Page 14, expenses increased $429 million from fourth quarter. As I highlighted at the start of the call, the increase was primarily driven by $752 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter. While we will not have the seasonally higher personnel expenses in the second quarter, there are certain expenses that will increase, including salary expense reflecting annual merit increases which became effective late in the first quarter, and certain expenses that are typically lower in the first quarter, such as outside professional services and advertising costs which are also expected to increase. We had $454 million of operating losses primarily driven by litigation expense in the first quarter.  Now that the FDIC has issued their final rule, I want to update you on the expected impact of the FDIC surcharge that I mentioned on our call last quarter, which is lower than we previously expected. We currently estimate that the surcharge along with a previously approved base rate reduction will increase our total FDIC assessment by approximately $100 million per quarter starting in the third quarter of 2016. Our efficiency ratio was 58.7% in the first quarter and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full year 2016. Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 15. Community banking earned $3.3 billion in the first quarter, down 7% from a year ago due to the discrete tax benefit we had in the first quarter of 2015 and up 4% from the fourth quarter. We continued to successfully grow retail bank households and increased our primary consumer checking customers which were up 5% from a year ago. This growth along with increased usage and new product offerings benefited our debit and credit card businesses.  Debit card purchase volume was $72.4 billion in the first quarter, up 9% from a year ago, and credit card purchase volume was $17.5 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Customers are increasingly using our award winning digital offerings with digital active customers up 6% from a year ago, including 17.7 million mobile active users with continued double-digit growth in mobile adoption. Wholesale banking earned $1.9 billion in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago and down 9% from the fourth quarter. The decline was driven by the higher provision expense in our oil and gas portfolio. Revenue grew 6% from the fourth quarter with growth in both net interest and non-interest income. This growth was driven by the gain on the sale of our crop insurance business and the benefit of the GE Capital acquisitions. Investment banking declined on overall market weakness and some of our commercial real estate related businesses had weaker results coming off a very strong fourth quarter performance. Loan growth remained strong driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $49.8 billion or 13% from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Average deposit balances declined $3.7 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower international deposits from market volatility and the competitive rate environment.  Wealth and investment management earned $512 million in the first quarter, down 3% from a year ago, down 14% from the fourth quarter. The year-over-year results reflect a strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 14% offset by the impact of weak equity market conditions on fee income. The decline in linked quarter results was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel costs.  Balance sheet growth remained strong with average deposits up 8% from a year ago and loans up 13%, the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth with continued growth in non-conforming mortgage loans and securities based lending.  We successfully completed our recruiting of financial advisors pursuant to our agreement with Credit Suisse. We were able to recruit substantially all of the advisors that we targeted. We are pleased with the success we've had recruiting these financial advisors and look forward to their contributions to our continued growth in wealth management. Turning to Page 18. Credit results continued to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only 38 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs increased $55 million from the fourth quarter, including an increase of $87 million from our oil and gas portfolio.  While our oil and gas portfolio remains under stress due to low prices and excess leverage in the industry, the rest of our loan portfolios have performed well. Non-performing assets increased $706 million from the fourth quarter, we had $1.1 billion in higher oil and gas non-accruals and $343 million in nonaccrual loan from the GE Capital acquisitions which was within our acquisition underwriting assumptions. These increases were partially offset by lower residential and commercial real estate non-accruals and lower foreclosed assets.  As I mentioned earlier, we had a $200 million reserve build during the quarter as continued improvements in our residential real estate portfolio were more than offset by higher oil and gas reserves. Since first quarter 2015 we have released $1.8 billion of allowance that was allocated to our residential real estate portfolios while providing $1.4 billion of additional allowance allocated to our oil and gas portfolio, demonstrating the advantage of our diversified loan portfolio. The total allowance now stands at $12.7 billion.  Slide 19 highlights the characteristics of our oil and gas portfolio, which is less than 2% of total loans outstanding. We had $17.8 billion of oil and gas loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, up $474 million from the fourth quarter, including $236 million in loans acquired from GE Capital. The remaining increase was driven by utilization of existing lines primarily in the E&P sector. The composition of our portfolio has remained relatively stable with 55% of our outstandings to the E&P sector, 21% to midstream and 24% to service companies.  Approximately 7% or $1.2 billion of our outstandings to investment grade companies based on public ratings. However there are other factors that are important to consider when assessing the quality of these loans. Our loans are primarily to middle market companies that we know well and have worked closely with across cycles. Of the approximately 100 bankruptcies that have occurred in the industry since the start of 2015, only eleven of our borrowers have filed during that time.  Our outstandings also included $819 million of second lien and $374 million of mezzanine loans. Our total oil and gas loan exposure which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding was down $1.3 billion or 3% from the fourth quarter with declines across all three sectors. This decline reflected reductions to existing credit facilities in part from spring redeterminations and net charge-offs. Approximately 34% of our unfunded commitments were to investment grade companies as their line utilization is generally lower. In addition to our exposure to oil and gas in our loan portfolio, we also had a total of $2.4 billion in our securities portfolio. Slide 20 highlights the credit performance of our oil and gas portfolio as we work through this cycle. The sector's performance has been driven by a number of factors that cumulatively have impacted loan quality. In addition to low oil and gas prices, cash flows and collateral values have been impacted by reduced production, run-off of hedges and limited additional cost levers. Reduced access to capital markets has also impacted borrowers\u2019 financial condition. As a result of these factors we had $204 million of net charge-offs in the first quarter. There were no losses from the midstream sector during the quarter. Non-accrual loans were $1.9 billion. We reviewed our loan portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and placed loans on non-accrual status when the full and timely collection of contractual interest or principal becomes uncertain, and loans are written down to net realizable value when appropriate. Approximately 90% of the non-accrual is recurrent on interest and principal. Payments received on these loans are applied to reducing principal which decreases future losses. Substantially all of our non-accrual loans are senior secured.  Given the conditions in the industry, criticized loans which include non-accrual loans increased 57% of the portfolio reflecting continued downward credit migration. This migration reflects changes in the borrower's financial condition. Reflecting the downward credit migration, our allocated allowance for the oil and gas portfolio increased $504 million to $1.7 billion. This portion of the allowance was 9.3% of total oil and gas loans outstanding. But as I've noted before, the entire $12.7 billion allowance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan portfolio.  Turning to Slide 21. In addition to building allowance for our oil and gas portfolio, we continue to focus on other areas where the trends in the oil and gas industry may impact performance as we manage through the cycle. For example, we have assessed regions of the country and have been monitoring 15 regions in eight states where greater than 3% of employment is directly tied to oil production and are also monitoring performance in Houston and Alaska, neither of which have 3% of employment directly tied to oil production.  We're tracking changes in outstandings, utilization, delinquency rates, FICO scores and LTV migration across our consumer portfolios in these regions and having outperformed the rest of our portfolio for the past several years consumer delinquencies in oil dependent regions have increased and are roughly in line with the performance in non oil concentrated communities. We currently anticipate further deterioration and while we remain committed to serving our customers, we\u2019ve tightened our underwriting standards across our consumer portfolios in oil dependent regions.  We're also actively monitoring commercial real estate exposure on a loan-by-loan basis in geographies highly correlated to the oil and gas industry. Our CRE and energy management teams are working closely together and coordinating monitoring activities. Our total exposure is manageable and these loans are generally structured with significant cash equity and various other credit enhancements.  In summary, we are actively monitoring the impact from the disruption in the oil and gas industry in all areas of our business and we're working closely with all impacted customers. We've increased the size of our workout team and the senior members of our credit team are devoting significant time to monitoring our exposures. We've started the spring redeterminations and are decreasing borrowing bases. We\u2019re proactively reviewing credit agreements and modifying credit terms and commitment amounts accordingly. While the level of losses we have in our oil and gas portfolio will continue to be impacted by the volatility and stress in the industry and it will take time to move through this part of the cycle, the experience of managing through many cycles will continue to be beneficial to our overall performance.  Turning to Page 22. Our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity tier one ratio fully phased in at 10.6% in the first quarter, well above the regulatory minimum buffers and our internal buffer. Our strong capital generation positioned us to deploy capital for the assets acquired from GE while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. We issued 35.5 million common shares in the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher employee benefit plan activity. But we still reduced our common shares outstanding by 16.2 million shares through share repurchases of 51.7 million. Our net payout ratio was 60% in the first quarter. In summary, our first quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model as we continued to produce strong financial results in an environment that included some near-term headwinds. Our consistent focus on executing on our vision continued to benefit our fundamental drivers of long term growth, including adding customers, loans and deposits while maintaining our strong capital position. We look forward to providing you more details on the strength of our business model while highlighting the quality of our team at our investor day on May 24. John and I will now answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just on the reserving and energy question -- thanks for the color John. So it seems like you've had a little bit more of the acceleration we've seen so far of those who have reported as far as the actual losses and the reserve build as well. How do we just get the understanding from here of the kind of pace of potential reserve additions? And then underneath that, are we effectively at the point where many benefits from lingering consumer reserve have kind of moved past? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Well, on the second part of your question, it\u2019s tough to say. Now we\u2019re analyzing the reserve every quarter and to the extent that there's continued improvement in consumer real estate in particular, it\u2019s certainly possible that that produces incremental benefit that absorbs some of what's happening on the oil and gas side, that's been true for a while and it may continue to be true for a while. Housing -- housing has been strong and that doesn't feel likely to reverse course right now. But again we only know at the end of the quarter.  With respect to the pace or the trend of incremental reserving throughout the year. We're constantly reassessing borrower quality, we're doing a semi-annual borrowing base redetermination on E&P loans where we are in the middle of the spring redetermination period right now, call it 20%, 25% have been completed, so we'll have the rest of that information, that's name by name, capital structure by capital structure. So that will continue to inform things and we've definitely taken steps or -- for example, categorize loans as non-performing even if we haven't completed their spring redetermination. But my sense is there's more information there. So this is going to go on for a while. We\u2019re in the $40 context today, we were in the 30\u2019s for a while. Some of these capital structures just need to be restructured. That will take some time. And my assumption is that we're going to be talking about this all year. I don't know that we'll continue to reserve at this pace all year. Because we feel great about a reserve at the end of the first quarter and it reflects everything that we know. But I'd be hesitant to tell you that this was the big quarter, or this was the quarter, things will unfold as they're going to unfold depending on what happens with what prices, both spot and forward and the pace of restructurings of services and E&P companies. John Stumpf : Ken, to remind you that, I mentioned that residential real estate losses were down 41% year over year. And I think that sometimes goes a bit unnoticed. When we went into the downturn, we had over $100 billion of pick-a-pay loans and over $100 billion of home equity loans and those were the two toughest residential portfolios. Today those portfolios are less than half of what we started with and the performance is really really good. So there is a lot of momentum on that side that has been \u2013 that\u2019s happened over the last few years, but especially in the last year or two. Ken Usdin : That's a fair point, John. Thanks for that. And just one follow up, on the redeterminations and the structuring, John, how far ahead can you get a redetermination? I get your point that we're only 25% through the spring. But have you already been able to get ahead of that just in terms of anticipation or you can only make those adjustments when we get there? And then also with the price back up, do we go into spring redetermination using a $40 plus starting point or do you still end up being much more punitive in terms of how you discount and how you redetermine? John Stumpf : Yes, I think that the price tag for this cycle is -- the front month is more in the mid 30s context. And it's a curve that you're using not just the spot price but we\u2019re probably 20% lower across our price deck curve in the spring versus where we were six months ago. And believe me that's not the only item that impacts the outcome. It's what's been going on with incremental exploration -- what are the reserves in terms of quantity and a variety of other things. But in terms of getting in front of it, as I said we're categorizing loans as non-performing. We're recognizing loss \u2013 these loss determinations, the $200 million that we've taken, that's our own credit folks determining that there is -- that there's something to be done, it\u2019s not as a result of a final resolution or a workout or the completion of a bankruptcy plan. And we can do that even before we've completed redetermination. So from an impact to Wells Fargo point of view, we're always trying to stay out in front of it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, I'll switch it up. In terms of net interest income, John, how much have you benefited from the December hike in the first quarter? Have all the variable loans repriced and will there be additional pull through benefit from that December hike into the second quarter? John Shrewsberry : So our estimation is that we've gotten the full benefit of the December rate hike. The benefit on the asset side, the cost on the liability side, we talked about the impact on deposits which has been negligible. And so I think that's in the run rate at this point. John McDonald : And then question for John Stumpf. What's the market like John for additional portfolio purchases? That's part one, and then part two is in terms of broader M&A, because of your size and favored nation status you're the kind of preferred name for news reporters and others that speculate on M&A for big financial companies, and since a lot's changed around the environment the last few years, can you just remind us your strategy around M&A, maybe how it's different than when you were smaller and how Dodd-Frank and Too Big To Fail might affect your view on acquisitions going forward? John Stumpf : Sure. As you probably know and those who know us well, 97% of the revenue we produce is from U.S. based customers, consumers, small business men and women, middle market large customers. And while we love our international business, it\u2019s mostly in support of our U.S. based businesses. And we have leadership positions in most of the businesses in which we do. And we don't set out to be number one, just to be number one. We work really hard and if we do really -- we provide great products and services and great value we grow because of that.  There's a couple of areas where we are sub-optimized that we are working hard to grow. One of those, I think the most attractive area would be the area that David Carroll runs in wealth investment management. You heard me say a number of times where we have 11% of the deposits or so in the country and just a fraction of that in terms of wealth assets here, even though we have a powerful wonderful group of leaders and advisors across the geography, we could still do a lot more business. There\u2019s a lot of our customers who call us their bank who have their wealth away. So we're working hard organically. That business has been growing double digits. If there was an opportunity to add something in that area that would make sense terrific. If there's not, that's also terrific.  On the consumer side, we have leadership in terms of distribution of our online activity, of our checking activity, or debit activity but not a credit card activity even though we've grown that significantly internally, about over 43% of our customers who have their primary account here have a credit card. But that's an area that, that would be opportunistic. We've been doing a great job organically, if there\u2019d be some opportunities along the line that would make sense we would surely consider that. But I would think of it this way, John. I would think of it that we have all that we need right now. And if something became available that we thought would be a bolt on, that would help us in those areas specifically but other areas generally, sure we\u2019d look at that. But that's our focus right now, our best opportunity to grow long term shareholder values here, value creation is doing more or just doing it better. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR & Company. Paul Miller : A lot of clients, a lot of questions that I have been getting is that yeah, energy, a lot of people might be reserved good for energy, but the second or third derivative of energy was a lot of the growth of this economy over the last year or two, and since energy is starting to struggle, that the economy's got in a recession, I know you've heard of it. But what are you seeing on the second and third derivatives on the credit book? Are you seeing any real deterioration in CRE markets in some of these areas like Texas where probably energy is hitting the hardest? John Shrewsberry : Sure. Well, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks in the consumer portfolios, all of them were growing, MSA by MSA and comparing the performance of our borrowers in the areas that are highly levered to energy. That the greater than 3% employment is one measure that we use but we've also included Houston for example to your point about Texas being hard hit even though it doesn't qualify with the 3% employment trigger. And what we've discovered is those areas have been performing better than average for a long time, no surprise, because that's where all the growth has been coming from and they're starting to look more average. So whether it's measures of delinquency, in some cases measures of LTV based on what's changing in asset values, they look a little bit more average. So it doesn't feel like it\u2019s a at least at this point that it's another shoe to drop in the short term. But as you expect less employment, people will \u2013 loans will perform differently. In commercial real estate, which is where we have a big presence, we've recently done a deep dive in Texas in particular. And office vacancies are somewhat higher in the Houston area, no surprise, I think about 20% including sublease space. Multifamily is a little bit weaker. And so we're looking at that first and foremost frankly with respect to what it means to our risk, to our own portfolio and we feel fine about what our exposures are there. But those are things that those regions are going to have to grapple with. So when it comes to growth rates or people who have more concentrated exposures than that, that probably is the first second order what people are going to have to look out for. More broadly speaking, I think we still feel we're in a 2% environment. There are obvious pockets of strength around the country but when you move out of oil and gas, we're in the same low growth, better consumer, strong employment environment that we've been operating in for a couple of years, not enough to make it feel like rates are going to move as a result of it but not enough to feel like we're stalling either. John Stumpf : Paul, if I can just give you an anecdotal. I lived in Texas for six years in the mid to late 90\u2019s, so 20 years ago and there was a period of time there -- there was volatility in the oil and gas space. And there was some challenges. And I've been back, I was just in Houston last week. And I've been back a number of times in the last year and things do feel different 20 years later. It's a much more diverse economy. And if you take Texas generally but Houston specifically and it feels different this time around. Downturns are always heard. Volatile markets always have an impact. But this feels different this time because of what the state has done to diversify their economy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : So my first question is actually a follow-up to John\u2019s question. My conversations with investors have often paired well just to be frank with either large credit card companies or there is clearly the rumor for Wells potentially buying a large investment bank which you formally denied. As we think about what you were saying, John, about looking at bolt-on opportunities, should we think about the deal size as sizes that are manageable enough that maybe sort of \u2013 the real stop here is Wells Fargo not moving up the SIFI surcharge? As we think about the opportunity for non-organic growth, should we think about sort of the hard stop in terms of size being that, you would like to keep your SIFI surcharge where it is today? John Stumpf : Erika, here's how I think about it. I think about Wells Fargo as an organic growth company. We have -- I've been here almost 35 years and I have probably been involved in \u2013 if there\u2019s 250 acquisitions we've done with all different companies, as we come to the modern Wells Fargo, I\u2019ve probably been involved in half of those, just because it happened during my career time. And they're hard to do. There is a lot of work in those things and we now have a company that is the best company I have ever worked for, the strongest brand, the best people, the furthest reach, the deepest relationship, the long enduring customer, thing so. So \u2013 and we are very very careful buyers. And I see us as has a lot of opportunity to grow, as I said organically. If something -- and what we've done in the last four or five years have been largely bolt on, I would say GE was a bigger, a little bigger bolt-on. But those are the kind of opportunistic things that make sense for our team, for our customers and ultimately for our shareholders. After all this is your money, our investors' money that we are the stewards of.  So it would be out of character for us to do something that would be -- have a high degree of risk and a low degree of shareholder reward on it. That's just not who we are. Erika Najarian : Thank you, John, that was very clear. My second question is just looking to capital return, since you have been CCAR participant, it seems like your GAAP earnings volatility is the least among your large peers. As we look forward -- obviously you can't tell us about this year\u2019s CCAR submission -- but as you look forward, how are you feeling about potentially continuing to push on that 30% dividend \u2013 implicit dividend ceiling? John Stumpf : It's hard to comment on that during the middle of the CCAR cycle. But I admire you for asking. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor : I just want to delve into a couple of potential earnings levers going forward. I guess the first one would be, as we think about the liquidity that you've built, since you chose not to reinvest as much in the securities book, how are you thinking about that pool of funds going forward and there's not really any signs that rates are going to rise materially as we think about market rates, we\u2019re obviously off the bottom. But what's your approach to managing that liquidity from here? John Shrewsberry : So it will be informed week by week, quarter by quarter as we assess the likelihood of increases in both short and consequently long term rates. We won\u2019t sit idly on continuous increases in cash forever. We're going to have to put some of it to work, we\u2019re very cautious about what it means entering at these levels in terms of capital impact in the future, if a subsequent rate rise does occur that's obviously a big issue for us. And we'd like to be smart about our entry points. But if we're going to hover in the 170s, just to pick a number on the ten year and with mortgage rates where they are, then there will be some amount of redeployment. We\u2019ll probably talk about it a little bit more at investor day. But it was really the abrupt market volatility that happened after the first of the year that caused us to say, let's take a pause here and figure out where this is going to settle out. It's happened to have settled out not much above the low points, at least again on a ten-year from January, early February. But that is an earnings lever when and if we redeploy. Matt O'Connor : And then just separately on the expenses, maybe just talk about \u2013 is there any kind of change or even tweak on the approach to expense management given maybe weaker revenues and some of the ongoing pressures in energy likely lingering? John Stumpf : There is a continuous drumbeat and a high level of vigilance around how we spend all of our business as usual types of dollars, we\u2019re constantly trying to find levers and ways to be more efficient to streamline to make things consistent. We've provided some examples of that in the past in certain areas there. At the same time we've talked about the investment that we're making in technology, the investments that we\u2019re making in product capability, the investments that we\u2019re making in risk management compliance and being a better firm. Those are going to be elevated for some time and they have been for some time. We're still comfortable in our 55% to 59% range which is where we've guided that, I don't need to remind you but that is a very attractive level for a firm of our size. We think we're pretty lean overall. But it's because we take this seriously day in and day out looking for ways to be efficient. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Bill Carcache : Thank you. Good morning. Of your borrowers who drew on their oil and gas lines this quarter, was there any notable deterioration in their credit profile? I was just trying to understand the extent to which heightened degrees of financial stress is a factor, leading your borrowers to draw down their lines. And although you mentioned that your current reserve reflects everything that you currently know today. I was wondering how you're thinking about the probability that more and more of your unfunded exposure will eventually become funded as we move deeper into the credit cycle? John Shrewsberry : Sure, that's a good question, and of course we absolutely have to make estimates about what we think the exposure at default would be for any borrower who's got a remaining unfunded commitment, that's how the process works. In the quarter there were some of these, what you might characterize as defensive draws that we've observed, not that many of them. You can see the increase in the total outstandings in oil and gas rose by about $400 million and about half of that was from frankly leases that we picked up from GE that have a credit mark in them incidentally. So it really didn't amount to that much. But it is a phenomenon that we've seen, that we've read about. It isn't having that big of an impact today but we do think that we're capturing that risk as we assess what the appropriate size is of our allowance for both funded and unfunded commitments in the space. Bill Carcache : So when I guess a previously unfunded energy loan commitment becomes funded, how does that transition from unfunded -- funded impact your allowance, I guess I think generally the reserve rate on unfunded commitment is lower than it is on funded commitments but just trying to understand the reserving dynamics there of shifting from one bucket to the other? John Shrewsberry : So in the calculation of the allowance and the migration of credit that leads up to our \u2013 whether we consider a borrower relationship to be non-performing or what status we're marking at, we're imagining on a credit by credit basis what the exposure at default would be if it is meaning that it could be greater than the currently outstanding amount. That's part of the loan by loan process, analysis by analysis that we do when building it -- when rewriting loans every quarter and building up for the allowance. So there's some estimation of what today is currently unfunded will become funded in the future. Bill Carcache : Thank you, and if I can just ask a final follow up. Can you discuss the methodology underlying your energy reserve, is it based more on the ability of borrowers to repay their loans through cash flow generation or is it more a kind of reliant on collateral coverage based on reserves in the ground? There are some reports suggesting that regulators are less happy with collateral coverage and I was wondering if you could kind of speak specifically to the approach that Wells Fargo has taken? John Stumpf : Well, it's a combination of both. And they're highly correlated for E&P companies in particular. But if their sources of repayment both principal and interest in full and on time and we\u2019re taking into account our projections of their cash flows, and we're taking into account our projections of the value of collateral that we might have to liquidate in order to get paid back or that they might have to liquidate in order to pay us back. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to switch gears here and look at your auto exposure. You're obviously one of the largest auto lenders in the country and you\u2019re growing that portfolio by roughly 30% over the last three years. Given what we've seen in the industry and some deterioration in the subprime portfolios, could you help us get an understanding of what your expectations are through the rest of this year and into 2017 given the state of the auto industry and how hot it\u2019s been over the last couple of years? John Stumpf : Sure. Well, we\u2019ve \u2013 I think we've been pretty public with the fact that we're going to hold our ground with respect to what we think our quality loan terms and borrower profile, and we've actually seen our share slip a little bit as the overall size of the auto finance market has kept pace with the sale of autos, new cars in particular that has been at a record level now for a few years. And we were number one, I think we're number two right now and we\u2019re bidding on buying the loans that we like at terms that we think are good risk reward and we're passing on those that we don\u2019t. Some of the things that feel a little bit different right now, I mean seasonally obviously we're in a better place in Q1 than Q4 just because those loans behave that way, collections and losses are lower in the first quarter than they are in the fourth quarter. It's a little bit -- things are a little bit elevated first quarter to first quarter but we're still from a risk adjusted basis well within the bands to which we underwrite each level of credit risk in autos that we buy. Where we've always had our eye on the elevated level of used car auction prices, the Manheim Index in particular is evidence that we point to get a sense for whether loss given default is going to be worse in the future than it is today or in the recent past and that index has been down I think 3% linked quarter, 2% year over year. So all things being equal we'd expect severity to be a little bit worse when repossessions occur.  But having said that we're still not in a bad place. We've allowed our market leading position to slip a little bit, let other people buy the loans that don't make sense for us, it\u2019s still a great business for us and has been for a long time. We work very closely with dealers, have a big floor plan business, we have a big commercial banking business with the dealership community. And we're in this for the long haul. One more thing I guess, we've observed is because the ABS market has been under pressure, some of the probably most aggressive players in the subprime space have a little bit of a funding challenge I think in this environment that may soften things up a little bit. Those are my current observations. Kevin Barker : So just to follow up on that, I mean, are you seeing better risk adjusted returns in sub prime auto versus prime auto right now and are you growing the subprime auto portfolio at effective rate? John Stumpf : We've sort of held the line. Using our own approach to what a subprime borrower and sub-prime dealer is we've limited ourselves to at about 10% of our originations which is amounted to about 10% of our outstandings that we\u2019d consider to be -- we consider to be subprime. There's often an opportunity to grow that if we wanted to, we've chosen not to. And we like the risk return that we get in where we choose to participate in that space. It's performed very well. It's priced for the risk and it frankly doesn't compete directly with some of the specialty finance companies that are in that space, they tend to be a little bit deeper and they're running a different business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital. Joe Morford : I guess, first, just a quick follow up on Ken\u2019s question at the outset. Just I was curious how much the increased oil and gas reserving a provision this quarter can be attributed to the shared national credit exam. John Stumpf : I\u2019d say very little. And the exam came and went and it worked out fine, there weren\u2019t a lot of disagreements on how we rate loans and also the guidance around leverage levels et cetera was introduced and that didn't have much of an impact on it. This is just \u2013 these are our folks using consistent methodology making determinations on when loans should be non-performing, when we should take loss et cetera. Joe Morford : That's very helpful, thanks. I guess the other question was just, wondering if you could talk a bit more about the \u2013 how the GE Capital business integrations are going and how are you feeling currently about the potential for cross selling or revenue synergies. And also just wondering if you can quantify the impact we may see in the second quarter from a full run rate of expenses? John Stumpf : I like the first part of the question better. But it is a big opportunity. So this is early stages, this is an important and big integration. So It'll take a full year or two to get where we need to go into transition all of the services away from GE and over to Wells Fargo and get things running. I'm happy to say that the early reports are that we're doing great with customers and team members. I think we imagine that there's a real opportunity with these customers. These are businesses where GE has been an absolute leader and they've done that with credit. So now we've got that credit capability and that credit willingness and the perfect business model for that but we also have all of the other. wholesale banking products and services, wealth management services et cetera to bring to bear on this client group. So it will take a while to work with each relationship and find out what they're doing that might be done at Wells Fargo in addition to their credit but my sense is it will be a great adoption over time and that's part of what makes it such a high value opportunity for Wells Fargo. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Just a couple more questions on energy and then on expenses. On energy, what percentage of that 1.2 billion in second lien exposure that you provided is nonperforming; do you have that? John Shrewsberry : Yeah. Let's see. $113 million of the combined second lien and mezzanine, it today is categorized as non-accrual. John Pancari : And what is your energy criticized ratio as of March 31? I know last quarter it was 38% approximately. John Shrewsberry : Yeah. It's 57% now. And that reflects the environment that we\u2019re in, that reflects what's going on with the stress of the borrowers, that's what -- that migration is what leads us to provide more reserve. John Pancari : And then through the 25% of the spring redeterminations that you completed, what's been the average reduction in borrowing base that you have seen? John Shrewsberry : Well, so I guess I'd start by saying that 50%, 60% have actually had a reduction in the borrowing base. A quarter had no change in the borrowing base. And the balance actually had an increase in the borrowing base because of more reserves that were included in the borrowing base. But without getting too specific on the amount of the reserve for people who had a reduction, it was relatively significant and frankly reflected the curve that we're using today versus where we would have been a quarter ago. John Pancari : And then lastly on the expense side, could you just give us a little more color on, why the incentive comp increases much as it did this quarter particularly on the backdrop of some of the revenue hedging? John Shrewsberry : Yeah, it's not really incentive comp so much. It\u2019s -- think about FICA resetting in the first quarter, contributions to our 401(k) happened in the first quarter. And then for people who are retirement eligible -- there's lots of people at Wells Fargo who get an annual equity incentive as part of their pay, for most people it vests over a few years and the impact bleeds in over the vesting period. If you're already retirement eligible it all hits in the quarter that is granted because it's immediately vested. And that's why the first quarter has that extra impact. It's not so much about -- commissions and incentives are piece of it but it's just -- it reflects the actual business activity that's happening. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Couple questions, one and I'll get the energy one out of the way first. So I think you mentioned 25% of your loans went through the redeterminations process in the quarter; is that right? John Shrewsberry : That\u2019s just where we happen to be to date for the spring redetermination, the rest of them are underway. It's a borrower by borrower analysis. Betsy Graseck : So as of the ones that were finished during the quarter, how much incremental reserve was required? Is that what drove the reserve up? John Shrewsberry : What drives the reserve up is our categorization of the loan as -- generally speaking as non-accrual or non-performing, meaning that we think there's a chance that we won't get full and timely repayment of every dollar of principal and interest. That can certainly come about in connection with the redetermination but it can come about for other reasons as well just in terms of our review of the company's overall performance, the value of their collateral, what their prospects are. So it's not really a linear \u2013 but you can't really draw a line between the redetermination specifically and the change in reserves. Betsy Graseck : It could have some impact but \u2013 John Shrewsberry : It would definitely have an impact, if we reduce somebody\u2019s availability and if they were drawn above their availability and we actually had a moment of reckoning where they had to write a check, that will accelerate that analysis, because they will have something that they have to do right then and there. There aren't that many instances of that. Betsy Graseck : It's just that as we go through the rest of the 75% of redetermination for the spring, that could drive some more expense reserve requirements. John Shrewsberry : It could. I mean it could. We capture a lot of that in our general assessment in our risk rating before having the actual results of the redetermination. But it certainly could. Betsy Graseck : And then just a question on recent balance sheet. So you brought down Fed funds a bit, is that right? John Shrewsberry : We\u2019re up. We were $30 billion higher in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter because we were less active in the bond market. Betsy Graseck : And that was mostly because of your view on rates and where you wanted to reinvest? John Shrewsberry : Yes. Betsy Graseck : So a 25 bp increase in rates today, are you in a more asset sensitive position now because of that? John Shrewsberry : I think that's right. Betsy Graseck : Any sizing or \u2013 John Shrewsberry : No, we are more asset sensitive as a result. We also have more long term debt that came under in the quarter. So there's a handful of things going on at the same time. But at the margin we're probably a little bit more asset sensitive. Betsy Graseck : And then on the redeployment into securities, I know, you might want to have a higher rate to redeploy into, but is there a point where you say you know what, I wanted to but it's been 17 for five, six, seven, eight months whatever it is, I am going to start to redeploy some of my cash into longer duration paper. I mean, can you just give us a sense as to how you think about? John Shrewsberry : Well, that is the discussion that we're having it regularly in our ALCO meetings with the board et cetera. My sense is that in this low rate environment we\u2019d probably not go as far out in terms of duration so that we were taking less capital risk even though the dollar for dollar return would be a little bit lower. But it's the tradeoff between foregone earnings, capital sensitivity and a handful of other things that we're having to assess and we're doing it with our best estimate of where we think rates are going and what happens if they don't go there. And so the long and the short of it is I don't think that we're going to continue to build cash balances like we did in the first quarter. But we know we're reassessing every day to make a determination on at what entry point and at what point in the curve we\u2019re interested in putting on more duration risk. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo : Hi, how much did the GE acquisitions add to EPS this quarter and what do you expect it to add for the rest of the year? John Shrewsberry : So we're not breaking out what it added during the quarter. And what we're saying is we think it will be modestly accretive for the rest of the year. And it really is about what it costs to transition people, technology, premises etc. throughout the remainder of the year. We'll update that as we move along and we've got more information about how those costs are actually coming in and being spent. But I\u2019ll tell you that the average asset yield for those assets reflects the same kind of loan mix that we have in wholesale banking in general and the expectation once it's -- once they're fully integrated and we've finished our process is that they will carry the same type of efficiency ratio as the average wholesale lending business. John Stumpf : Actually Mike, in the first quarter it was a little bit of -- couple moving parts here, we actually, if you will, pre-funded the liability side, meaning that we've raised the debt to fund this and that was on the books at the start of the quarter and most of the loans only came on March 1. So there's a lot of stuff going on in the first quarter. But there's one month worth of really revenue if you will. Mike Mayo : So three months of funding, one month of revenues, so you'll see the full benefit in the second quarter. I was just wondering if you could size that a little bit more. John Shrewsberry : Well, we're talking about $30-ish billion worth of assets and the same type of loan yields that we have on average in wholesale, which gets you to a revenue number. What we're not specifically breaking out is what the expense impact is until we understand what the full integration expenses are. But you'll see $350 million per quarter of NII from the loans and leases themselves. Mike Mayo : And how much of that did you have in the first quarter, the $350 million? John Shrewsberry : Well, so as John said we had one month of the revenue side of it. We had not quite three months worth of the funding cost because we weren\u2019t fully funded for those three months. But more than one month's worth of funding costs about that. Mike Mayo : And then separately, John, did I hear you correctly, you said benefits of falling oil prices offset the costs. I think you said that at the start of the call. John Stumpf : Yeah, I said -- since we're still a net importer of energy and what's interesting, Mike, is that much of that savings at the consumer level have been saved, if you will, and have not yet been spent. So not all the savings at the pump. What consumers have done and that not exclusively but they're saving more of that what's happening at the pump as opposed to spending it. Mike Mayo : And how do you see that? In other words, when oil prices go down, the stock market declines, bank stocks sell off. And you're saying the market's wrong with that. What do you see in your business that you think maybe the market has wrong in how they think about oil prices? John Stumpf : I don't \u2013 I have long stopped trying to figure out the market and why bank stocks or stocks seem to move in concert with commodity prices especially oil prices but be that as it may, the consumer, much of this economy, 60%, 70% is consumer based and in retail and the consumers have never been in better shape. I mentioned in my comments just the debt service requirements is 15% of their earnings and wage is certain of up a little that and we're seeing savings rates go up. These are some of the strongest savings rates we've seen in some time. I don't know if that\u2019s a statement about confidence or whatever but there is -- consumers are benefiting from filling your tank at the dollar something a gallon or two dollars a gallon versus three or four and not all of it has been spent. Mike Mayo : And then the last question, just give us a sneak preview of the investor conference. What do you hope to achieve at the investor conference and do you think you will have a director show up again at? John Stumpf : Well, thank you Mike for reminding everybody that Steve Sanger, our lead director showed up last time. Obviously we invite our directors and just give me a chance to invite all of you. It's on the 24th of next month, it\u2019s a Tuesday. We have an exciting day to share with you. We will get very granular about how we think about distribution, how we think about our businesses. It will give us a chance to showcase next generation leaders in the company. So we're looking forward to it. We also will think about Guardrails around our three big metrics, we talk about ROA, ROE, and efficiency ratio, if I talk about that, so it's a bunch of things. And also everybody talks about FIN Tax and clearly there's a good reason for that. I think our company specifically and our industry generally have been innovators for a whole long time. So if we weren't we'd have stagecoaches on the freeway right now. So we\u2019ll talk a little bit about that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Eric Wasserstrom : There's been some recent media attention to the buildout you've been doing in some of your advisory and capital markets capacities. And I'm wondering what your -- how you view that now in light of course the broader marketplace for those services which may be under some pressure and then also the fact that your exposure specifically to the energy industry within those business lines is a bit higher than peers. Is that changing your interest in investment in those areas? John Stumpf : Not really. The pattern has been the same since the merger of Wells and Wachovia to make sure that we've got the right level of capability for capital raising and advisory activity and hedging and risk management activity for our corporate and commercial customers and other customers of Well Fargo who need it. We think our risks are well sized, we think our capabilities are well sized. As always, as you point out there are things to add here and there but from a return point of view, from an ability to service our customers point of view, we like the trajectory we've taken. That's why it's so easy to respond pretty quickly when people speculate that we might be thinking about adding an investment bank to our mix or something. That's not what we need. What we need is what we have today and more great people like it to serve more customers but we're not thinking much differently about it. Our results frankly were -- we think they're pretty good in the first quarter. As you say we have been a leader in capital raising and advisory work for the energy industry for a while. There will be plenty more need for that as the industry repairs itself and being in a position to provide that is actually it's good for us.  We've got industry leading positions in a handful of other industries as well, energy is just one of them. But like others it's a cyclical business and while there is less capital raising going on there right now there's more going on in other spaces and a lot of advisory work to do. So it fits together very nicely with our wholesale bank. Eric Wasserstrom : And is your intent to continue to add personnel into those business lines? John Stumpf : Yes I think so. We're always -- we're always \u2013 as I say industries come and go with respect to their capital needs and advisory needs and so we want to make sure that we've got the right people in positions to do the right thing, where we become an employer of choice for a lots of those activities. Wells Fargo is a very nice place to work. We've got a great customer franchise who wouldn't want to work here in those businesses compared to some of the places that they might be coming from and we're always adding good people. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Nancy Bush : And John, it kind of got lost in the hoopla yesterday about the living wills. But there was a Reuters news item that says Wells Fargo has become significantly more important to the health of the global financial system in the past few years, says a report by the office of financial research. And it strikes me with what came out in the resolution letters yesterday that maybe being too important to the global financial system may not be an entirely good thing. And I'm wondering if you feel at this point that your growth or lines of business your plans for those might be impacted by these findings. John Shrewsberry : So Nancy, we went and looked at that report after that wacky headline hit the cave and. And it reported the same thing it reported a year ago which is that we're number seventeen among GSIBs in the lowest risk category among globally systemically important banks. So there's no basis for that story. We are a big bank, we are globally systemically important and we're used to being measured. But we ended up toward the bottom of that list. So that was a funny conclusion that was drawn.  With respect to the feedback that we got in the living wills. There are some actionable things that we're going to get right on. But there's nothing about size, about complexity, about the nature of our business model, about our capital, about our liquidity. And really it was much more around proper governance and maturation of the process et cetera which are things that are addressable. So frankly I don't think we're being criticized by our regulators for the types of things that work their way into the financial press. John Stumpf : But surely we're disappointed in the resolve and all hands on deck here and we value the feedback we got from the Fed and FDIC and we are committed to have a great submission later this year. Nancy, one thing I would like just to share for a few minutes, even though our company has grown and grown significantly organically, principally organically over the last seven or eight years, we have continued to simplify our business and we're \u2013 and we've shed businesses quietly that either didn't have scale for us or provided or had a risk reward relationship that was not consistent. So just let me just check off a few, I was just thinking while John was talking. We're no longer in the wholesale mortgage business. We're not in the joint venture business. We're not in the reverse mortgage business. We're not in the mortgage consolidation business. We have FHA overlays. So we're not as deep in that business as we had been in the past. We just sold our RCIS insurance business. The direct deposit advance business is no longer here. We're not in the government student lending business. We use it at our Wells Fargo financial business, that it's very different today. So yes we've grown in deposits. And we've grown in our corporate loans and all and wealth management and all other kind of things that we're involved in but a much simpler company, say, in many respects. Nancy Bush : Now that you've \u2013 if I may ask, you've sort of opened up the living will issue and if I may ask if there are any of this feedback that you got yesterday that you feel is related to residual issues that are left over from the Wachovia deal. And I think I will just say that as an analyst it was no great secret in the industry that they were not the best on the reporting side. Are there any tasks left undone that were related to that merger that may have played into your feedback yesterday? John Stumpf : No, we own this and we're going to get this right. Nancy Bush : If I could ask a totally unrelated question, home equity lines of credit seem to be coming back into favor both at the banks and among consumers. Can you just speak to that business? You've always been important in it. Is it growing now and how do you feel about it? John Shrewsberry : Because of the starting point that Wells Fargo has had the numbers have really only been going in one direction, which is down, down, down. The product that we have today where we do sell it is an amortizing product right out of the gate, so it's very different than it was in the old days where it was more just incremental leverage, that frankly didn't come down until it might hit some amortization point in the future. So we certainly offer that amortizing product to our customers. But I don't think you'll see it make a difference in our reported consumer real estate assets. Really on our balance sheet it\u2019s more about prime jumbo and non-conforming by balance types of loans to prime borrowers. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks. John, I've done a little bit of the math when you look at the cost of the liabilities on the GE and then the delay in the assets. It looks like from a net NII standpoint you pick up close to $200 million as you move into next quarter just from the balance sheet side. Just trying to piece it together best I could. Was there any timing effect on the expenses? So as you came in and brought the operations on board, did you have a pretty full run rate on the expense side versus next quarter? That is my real question, is there any also leverage in a sense that the expenses were already kind of in place for this quarter going into next quarter? John Shrewsberry : The big expenses it\u2019s related are people expenses. The people join -- the bulk of the people joined on March 1, so in the last month of the quarter, there are some people in the rail business that joined at the beginning of the year. Another meaningful expense will be depreciation expense on the lease assets that we're picking up and they come out of that -- that begins when the assets are in place. But importantly one of the reasons that we're describing this as modestly accretive in the year, is there's a whole lot of integration expense that needs to occur, including what we're paying for transition services that we're still getting from GE that will shift over to Wells Fargo at some point in the future \u2013 or very different points in the future. And then there's technology work to do. There's some loan file work to do, some paperwork to do, there's a lot of things that it takes to make all of those assets Wells Fargo assets in a regulated environment that we\u2019re operating in and we will pay incremental dollars in the near term to do that. So I\u2019d be hesitant to offer you up a run rate from March that reflects what Q2 or the rest of the year is going to look like. Marty Mosby : Would you be, on the expense side, isolating those as integration costs so we can know, not the total, but just as integration like you would do with any other kind of merger? And when we look at the seasonal uptick that we have in those employee-related expenses, typically you don't see a net benefit as it goes down because there's other expenses that offset that. But would you expect in the core expenses to see somewhat of a roll-down, given how high the seasonal expenses were this first quarter? Just two things on that side. John Shrewsberry : Yeah. Well, I expect that it will be between 55% and 59% in our efficiency ratio for the rest of the year on the high side of that. And that would capture the change in seasonal expenses, it's a good point that not all of that seasonal comp expense disappears and the whole net benefit doesn't come back, we call out in our deck. But there are some other things that are seasonally depressed in the first quarter that pick up in the second quarter. Not as big but that are seasonal in that way. And we'll see how material it is but if it becomes appropriate to provide clarity on the GE transition related expenses you might consider calling that out. But we haven't begun to yet because we're still developing those expenses, we\u2019re still coming into -- we're the early stage of execution on some of the technology oriented things that I mentioned and some other chunky early expenses that will start to run off after a bit. Marty Mosby : John, lastly trying to climb into your head a little bit, as you were looking at the first quarter and you had the gain from selling the crop insurance business and rates were going down and you had so much market disruption, were you kind of thinking, since I have this gain over here, I don't really feel comfortable putting my liquidity to work because of what\u2019s going on in the market. That gives me some breathing room to see where things fall and then start reinvesting in the second quarter, recreating the income that you gave up in the first quarter. John Shrewsberry : Investing in risk \u2013 in relatively risk free assets doesn't produce that much P&L in the quarter that we invest. So there really wasn't much of a trade off in the first quarter between the gain that reflects this business that we agreed to sell a few quarters ago, that closed this quarter. It's really -- the threshold issues on reinvestment are more around our capital sensitivity because we're going to be living with the valuation consequences of buying duration at a low yield entry point. And then that really is more where the trade off occurred. So thinking about the whole year impact maybe on interest income but also our OCI sensitivity if rates ultimately back up. End of Q&A John Stumpf : Okay, thank you all for joining us and also I want to say thank you to our 268,000 team members for serving our customers and producing a $5.5 billion of quarterly earnings that it\u2019s just a wonderful result on their behalf. And one more shout out to all of you. Please join us on the 24th, Tuesday -- May 24 in San Francisco for our investor day. Thank you much. Bye bye.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remark there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin the conference. Jim Rowe : Thank you, Regina and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. Please remember that this call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, John Stumpf. John Stumpf : Thank you Jim, good morning and thank you for joining us today. Our diversified business model and continued focus on meeting our customer's financial needs drove our performance in the second quarter, our 15th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. We produced strong performance during a period that has had - has included persistent low rates, market volatility and economic volatility, and we did it by focusing on the core building blocks of long-term shareholder value creation, that is growing relationships, loans, investments and deposits. Our loan and investment, and deposit balances are all at record levels and we've maintain our strong risk discipline. Let me highlight our results for the second quarter. We generated earnings of $5.6 billion and earnings per share of $1.01. We grew revenue compared with a year ago by 4%, with growth in both net interest income and non-interest income, and our pre-tax pre-provision profit grew 5%. We generated positive operating leverage, while we continued to make investments throughout our businesses. Average loans grew over $80 billion or 9% from a year ago. Average deposits increased $51.4 billion or 4% from year ago and we grew the primary - the number of primary consumer checking customers by 4.7%. Net charge offs remained near historical lows at 39 basis points annualized reflecting the benefit of our diversified loan portfolio and continued underwriting discipline. We returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the second quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of returning more than $3 billion. We continue to increase stockholder\u2019s equity which now exceeded $200 billion for the first time and we are pleased to have received a non-objection to our 2016 capital plan from the Federal Reserve. Incidentally, when the former Norwest, which when I came from and Wells Fargo merged 18 years ago, our total assets at the time were slightly less than $200 billion, now our stockholders\u2019 equity exceeds that. Remarkable results over that period of time. Turning to the economic environment, Brexit has added to global economic uncertainty and could result in rates remaining lower for even longer than expected putting pressure on reinvestment opportunities. However, compared to our large bank peers, it should have a much lower direct impact on our long-term business drivers because as you know we are largely a US centric company and many indicators point to continued relative strength in the US economy. After a couple of lackluster quarters, we estimate real GDP grew at 2.5% rate in the second quarter, up from 1.1% in the first quarter. Most of the improvement came from consumers where drivers were broad-based. Spending on big ticket items was especially robust and sentiment survey showed that consumer confidence remains strong. Home sales continue to rise with the second quarter on pace set the strongest quarterly sales volume since 2007. Price appreciation remained steady at the 5% to 6% rate nationally and appreciation isn\u2019t just restricted to coastal states, every state and 90% of all metro areas have experienced an increase during the past year. And job gains remains solid with 69 consecutive monthly increases, the longest on record including the strong June report released just last week. Before I conclude, I want to highlight the announce that we made earlier this week, Carrie Tolstedt, Head of Community Banking who has been with Wells Fargo for 27 years have decided to retire at year end. She and her team have built an extraordinary franchise one that meets the needs of millions of customers nationwide and has served investors very well for decades. Mary Mack who currently serves as President and Head of Wells Fargo Advisors will succeed Carrie effective July 31. Mary is a 32-year veteran of the financial services industry and has a diverse mix of experiences including retail banking, which will serve her well as she takes the reign of this key business. This transition highlights our commitment to stable long-range succession planning and our belief that our team members are our most valuable resource. I will now turn the call over to John Shrewsberry, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide more details on our quarterly results. John? John Shrewsberry : Thank you John and good morning everyone. My comments will follow the presentation included in the quarterly supplement starting on page 2, then John and I will answer your questions. Our results in the second quarter were straightforward and demonstrated momentum across a variety of key business drivers. Compared with the first quarter, we had strong loan and deposit growth, we increased net interest income by growing earning assets. Many of our customer facing businesses generated strong fee growth. Our efficiency ratio improved. Credit quality remained solid and our capital position remained strong while we returned more capital to shareholders through common stock dividends and share repurchase. Our net payout ratio was 62% in the second quarter. On page 3, you can see the strong year-over-year growth John highlighted including increases in revenue, pre-tax, pre-provision profit, loans and deposits. While our earnings were down $161 million from a year ago, our results in the second quarter last year included a $350 million reserve release while this quarter we had a $150 million reserve build primarily due to loan growth in commercial, auto and the credit card portfolios. Turning to page 4, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. With the expectation of rates remaining lower-for-longer, we grew our investment securities portfolio by $18.5 billion, with $38 billion of gross purchases in the second quarter significantly higher than the $5 billion repurchases last quarter and higher than the $26 billion of average quarterly purchases last year. We completed these purchases before the rate declined late in the quarter driven by the Brexit vote. We also added to duration as we've done in the past with interest rate swaps, the converted portion of our variable rate commercial loans to fixed rate, a $13 billion increase in swap notional from first quarter. Even with these actions we remain asset sensitive. Long-term debt increased $16 billion, with $24 billion of issuances including 10.7 - including $10.7 billion issued by the holding company, which we expect to be grandfathered as TLAC eligible. As we highlighted at Investor Day we expect that we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $50 billion in order to be compliant including a 100 basis point buffer which we plan to complete through measured issuance over the phase-in period of approximately five years. However this year we have a high level of debt maturing, so some of our eligible TLAC issuance will be used to offset these maturities. Turning to the income statement overview on page 5, revenue declined $33 million from the first quarter as growth in net interest income was offset by lower non-interest income. I will highlight the drivers of these trends throughout the call but let me discuss how the businesses we've sold and acquired impacted our results this quarter. As I mentioned at Investor Day for several years now we've been focused on reducing non-core businesses simplifying our organization and improving our risk profile. In the first quarter, we sold our crop insurance business and our results included a $381 million gain from that sale. While the impact to our ongoing earnings from selling this business is negligible, the sale did reduce insurance revenue and related insurance expense this quarter. In the second quarter, we sold our health benefit services business for $290 billion gain. The go forward effect from the sale of this business is not material to our financial results. Our results this quarter also reflected the acquisition of the GE Capital businesses that be completed in the first quarter, including the full quarter impact of the $26.7 billion of commercial and industrial loans and leases that closed on March 1. As we stated at Investor Day the quarterly benefit to net interest income from the GE Capital acquisition was approximately $300 million. Lease income also increased this quarter from the operating leases acquired along with corresponding higher operating lease expense. The acquisition of the Asia segment to GE Capital's commercial distribution finance business was completed on July 1 and the remaining international assets of approximately $2 billion are expected to close later this year. We are pleased with the overall integration of the GE Capital businesses and we still expect the GE Capital acquisition to be modestly accretive to our results this year. As shown on page 6, we had continued strong loan growth in the second quarter, up 8% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. Period end commercial loan balances grew $6.3 billion from first quarter, remember the GE Capital acquisition only impacted average loan growth this quarter. Consumer loans increased $3.6 billion linked quarter as growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit card and securities-based lending was partially offset by declines in junior lean mortgages and seasonally lower student lending. Our total average loan yield was stable at 4.16% as the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition was offset by lower consumer yields. On page 7, we highlight our broad-based year-over-year loan growth. C&I loans were up $39 billion or 14% driven by the GE Capital acquisitions and broad-based organic growth. Commercial real estate loans grew $10.7 billion or 8% primarily in our real estate mortgage portfolio. Real estate one-to-four family first mortgage loans grew $9.3 billion or 3% with strong growth and high quality non-conforming mortgage loans. As a reminder, we sell our conforming mortgage loan originations to the agencies. This portfolio also reflected the continued run-off of the pick-a-pay portfolio. Auto loans were up $4.1 billion or 7% with origination volumes up 2% while we maintained our underwriting and pricing discipline. Credit card balances were up $3 billion or 10% reflecting new account openings and increases in active accounts. Other revolving credit and installment loans were up $2.1 billion or 6% with growth in securities-based lending, personal lines and loans and student loans. As highlighted on page 8, we had $1.2 trillion of average deposits in the second quarter, up $51.4 billion or 4% from a year ago. Consumer and small-business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago and primary consumer checking customers grew 4.7% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost was 11 basis points, up 1 basis point from first quarter and 3 basis points from a year ago reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain wholesale banking customers. Page 9 highlights our revenue diversification. Our revenue continued to be relatively balanced between net interest and non-interest income while the drivers of non-interest income have varied, fee income was also 47% of revenue a year ago and last quarter. Market sensitive revenue which includes trading and gains on debt and equity securities can vary based on market conditions during the quarter. Our market sensitive results in the second quarter which included strong gains from trading and debt security gains was partially offset by lower equity gains. The sum was only $85 million higher than the five- quarter average. We grew net interest income $66 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by long growth including the full quarter benefit of the assets acquired from GE Capital. The benefit from loan growth was partially offset by reduced income at our investment securities portfolio reflecting accelerated prepayments primarily on our mortgage-backed securities. We also had higher interest expense from the long-term debt issuances that I highlighted earlier on the call and lower interest income from trading assets. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the first quarter primarily due to growth in long-term debt and deposits and reduced income from investment securities. All other balance sheet growth, mix changes and repricing was beneficial to the NIM. We grew net interest income in the second quarter by 4% from a year ago even with 11 basis point reduction in NIM. And we continue to believe that we can grow net interest income on a full-year basis in 2016 compared with 2015 in the current rate environment. While total non-interest income decreased $99 million from the first quarter, we had growth in many areas that reflect our focus on key business drivers including increases in service charges on deposit accounts, brokerage fees, trust and investment management, investment banking, card fees, gains on mortgage loan originations, trading gains on higher customer accommodation activity, and lease income reflecting the full quarter benefit from the GE Capital acquisition. Total mortgage banking revenue which includes both the gain on the sale from originations and servicing income declined $184 million from the first quarter. Production revenue increased $306 million or 41% reflecting higher originations. Origination volume was $63 billion, up 43% from the first quarter due to the seasonally stronger purchase market and increased refinancing due to lower rates. Applications were up 23% from first quarter and we ended the quarter with $47 billion application pipeline, up 21% from first quarter and up 24% from a year ago. Since Brexit and the related decrease in mortgage rates, we\u2019ve seen refinance activity increase with our retail application volumes up approximately 15% to 20% in recent weeks and we currently expect origination volume to be somewhat higher in the third quarter compared with the second quarter. Our production margin on residential held for sale mortgage originations was 166 basis points in the second quarter, down 2 basis points from the first quarter. Releases of our mortgage loan repurchase liability increased $69 million from the first quarter, which also contributed to higher production revenue. Servicing income declined $490 million from the first quarter primarily driven by changes in MSR valuation adjustments which were positive last quarter and slightly negative in the second quarter. There MSR valuation adjustments are outside the scope of our hedging and vary over time as MSR valuation assumptions are updated. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our hedge results in the second quarter given the increased rate volatility late in the quarter. Servicing income also declined from higher quarterly unreimbursed servicing costs, primarily related to FHA loans. Other income declined $392 million from first quarter, the reduction was driven by a decline in hedge and effectiveness income from $379 million in the first quarter to $56 million in the second quarter. The decline also reflected the gain from the sale of the crop insurance business recognized last quarter and the gain on the sale of our health benefits services business in the second quarter with a net impact from these sales of $91 million lower other income compared with the first quarter. As shown on page 12, expenses declined $162 million from the first quarter, driven by lower personal expenses which are typically higher in the first quarter due to higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement eligible team members. Expenses also declined from lower operating losses, down $120 million from the first quarter on lower litigation expense. Insurance expenses declined $89 million reflecting the sale of the crop insurance business in the first quarter. Partially offsetting these declines was an increase of $186 million from outside professional services after typically lower expenses in the first quarter. Operating lease depreciation expense was up $117 million from the first quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of the leases acquired from GE Capital. As a reminder, beginning in the third quarter, we estimate that our total FDIC assessment will increase by approximately $100 million per quarter reflecting the temporary FDIC surcharge which became effective July 1. Our efficiency ratio was 58.1% in the second quarter and we currently expect to operate at the higher end of our targeted efficiency ratio range of 55% to 59% for the full-year 2016. While we\u2019re already operating at one of the best efficiency ratios in the industry, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth. While total expenses have increased, we\u2019ve reduced expenses in many categories even as we've grown the balance sheet by acquiring businesses and adding new customers. The increase in expenses is primarily been related to risk, compliance and technology spending reflected in higher personal expense, outside professional services and contract services. We\u2019ve also continued to invest in innovation to better serve our customers. Let me give you just a few examples. During the second quarter, we launched the FastFlex Small Business Loan, an online fast decision loan that funded as soon as the next business day. This was an innovation we built in-house. In addition, we launched yourFirstMortgage, a new home loan program to help more qualified first-time homebuyers and low to moderate income consumers become homeowners. Early reaction to this program has been positive with over $1 billion of applications in the first 30 days. And wholesale banking, we introduced biometric authentication by piloting eyeprint image capture technology in our commercial electronic office mobile channel. This line highlights just a few examples that we\u2019ve recently announced, we\u2019re working on additional products and services within our innovation group that are scheduled to be released over the coming quarters that we believe will add tangible long-term value for our customers and shareholders. Turning to our business segment starting on page 14; community banking earned $3.2 billion in the second quarter, down 1% from a year ago and 4% from the first quarter. We remain focused on providing outstanding customer service and achieved record store customer loyalty scores during the second quarter and the highest year-to-date retail banking household retention in four years. We continually work to enhance customer satisfaction and transparency and ensure customers are receiving the right products to meet their financial needs. Because the key to our success is long lasting customer relationships built on trust. For example, an hour after opening a new deposit account, our customers are sent a customized welcome email including a summary of accounts in ways to get the full value from their accounts. We are also focused on using innovation to enhance our customer experience. Mobile banking is our most frequently used channel and we have 18 million mobile active users. Beginning August 1, our mobile customers will be able to make real-time person-to-person payment. P2P payments are not new to Wells Fargo with our customers conducted over $10 billion in P2P volume through our SurePay service in 2015. We were the number one debit card issuer by transaction volume which increased 9% from a year ago while dollar volume was $76.4 billion, up 8% from a year ago. Credit card purchase volume was $19.4 billion, up 10% from a year ago benefiting from 8% active account growth. Credit card penetration to retail banking households increased to 45.6%, up from 44.6% a year ago. Wholesale banking earned $2.1 billion in the second quarter, down 5% from a year ago and up 8% from the first quarter. The decline from a year ago was driven by higher provision expense related to the oil and gas portfolio. However charge offs for wholesale banking are still historically low with only 27 basis points of net charge offs annualized in the second quarter. Revenue grew 10% from a year ago and 5% linked quarter as net interest income and non-interest income both increased on a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. Loan growth remained strong driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $65.2 billion or 17% from a year ago, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. Spreads on new originations were slightly better than the existing portfolio. Average deposit balances declined $6.6 billion from a year ago, driven by lower international deposits from market volatility and our pricing discipline in the competitive rate environment. Wealth and investment management earned $584 million in the second quarter, stable from a year ago and up 14% from the first quarter. Our diversified revenue streams provided stability during a period of market volatility. Second-quarter revenue of $3.9 billion was up 2% linked quarter and down 1% year-over-year. Our Continued emphasis on meeting our client's financial needs through planned based relationships resulted in record high WIM client assets of $1.7 trillion, up 2% from a year ago with gross resulting from both existing client relationships as well as new client acquisitions. Net interest income was up 12% year-over-year driven by continued strong balance sheet growth. Average deposits were up 9% from a year ago and loans were up 12%, the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Loan growth was broad-based with strong client demand across a number of product offerings. We are very excited to welcome Kristi Mitchem who became the Head of Wells Fargo Asset Management on June 1. She has strong industry experience and will lead this business into the next phase of strategic expansion and growth. Turning to page 17, credit results continue to benefit from our diversified portfolio with only 39 basis points of annualized net charge offs. Net charge offs increased $38 million from the first quarter including an increase of $59 million from our oil and gas portfolio which was partially offset by $46 million of lower consumer real estate losses. Non-performing assets decreased $433 million from the first quarter as lower residential and commercial real estate non-accruals and foreclosed assets were partially offset by higher oil and gas non-accruals. As I mentioned earlier, we had $150 million reserve build during the quarter primarily related to long growth in the commercial, auto and credit card portfolios. Slide 18 highlights our oil and gas portfolio, while oil prices have risen from where they were a year ago there continues to be pressure in the oil and gas sector. We had $263 million of net charge offs in this portfolio in the second quarter, up $59 million from the first quarter with approximately 94% of losses from the E&P and services sector. Non-accrual loans were $2.6 billion, up $651 million from the first quarter on weaker financial performance, the run-off of borrower hedges and less sponsor support. Approximately 90% of non-accruals were current on interest in principle, most of the losses we\u2019ve taken were from non-accruals that were current but we recorded losses based on our judgment of not being repaid in full. Our oil and gas loans outstanding declined 4% from the first quarter and were down 2% from a year ago. Oil and gas loans of $17.1 billion are less than 2% of total loans outstanding. Our oil and gas loan exposure which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding was also down 4% from first quarter and down 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by borrowing base reductions. We had no defensive draws in the second quarter. And as in every challenging cycle, we are also seeing opportunities and we originated new loans during the second quarter to well-qualified borrowers. Criticized loans which include non-accrual loans were down $1.7 billion or 17% from first quarter reflecting paydowns, borrowing base upgrades and net charge offs. And for the first time in the past six quarters we did not have a reserve build for oil and gas portfolio and reserve coverage was stable at 9.2% of total oil and gas loans outstanding. Our reserves declined from $1.7 billion to $1.6 billion reflecting the increase in energy prices with slower pace of deterioration in credit quality improved criticized asset levels and the smaller loan portfolio. Overall the performance of our oil and gas portfolio in the second quarter was consistent with our expectations and our experience of managing through many cycles will continue to benefit us and our customers as we move through the remainder of the cycle. Turning to page 19, our capital levels remain strong with our estimated common equity tier-1 ratio fully phased in at 10.6% in the second quarter, well above the regulatory minimum and buffers, and our internal buffer. We reduced our common shares outstanding by 27.4 million shares through share repurchases of 44.8 million. We also increased our common stock dividend in the second quarter to $0.38 per share. Our net payout ratio was 62% within our targeted range of 55% to 75%. In summary, our second quarter results demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, we had solid returns with a 1.2% ROA, 11.7% ROE and our return on tangible common equity was 14.15%. We\u2019ve continued to benefit from executing on our vision with success in growing customers, loans and deposits. The headwinds from a flatter yield curve and a lower-for-longer rate environment creates challenges for all financial institutions but we will continue to focus on what we can control earning lifelong relationships with our customers which drive our long-term growth opportunities. John and I will now answer your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Just taking a step back John, I think you said in your prepared remarks that investors own this company given your ability to grow earnings regardless of what's happening in the market, is this flatter yield curve persists and we don't have - we don't see rehikes from the Fed, I'm wondering what you think are your strongest levers for supporting EPS growth from here? Is it continued balance sheet growth, is it even more disciplined expense management, is it growth and fees in businesses where you don't have scale yet, just trying to figure out, Wells always have as a reputation for pulling on levers to support EPS growth and I'm wondering as we look out over the next 12 months what you think are the most impactful ones are? John Shrewsberry : I think it's all of the above Erika, you mentioned in broad terms the likeliest sources, if rates are going to remain lower, we will work hard at earning asset growth. And the first call on our capital and liquidity is to serve customers, so we'll be looking for loan growth and we've had great success in organic loan growth in commercial categories as well as in consumer categories. So that would be job one. I think we\u2019re seeing nice momentum across a variety of the fee streams that we have, I mentioned some of them in my remarks but there are many and we\u2019ve - some of them were - our businesses where we already have complete scale and some of them are businesses that that we\u2019re - where we\u2019re under indexed and continuing to grow. So maybe the long-term opportunity is even bigger. I think we're working hard at expense discipline in this environment to accomplish all that we are trying to accomplish in compliance and risk management but innovate at the same time and stay within our range which we've managed to do. And as I also called out, we\u2019re sort of - we\u2019re comping over periods where we had been releasing excess allowance and now because our loan portfolio is growing, we\u2019re building some allowance, so we\u2019re muscling through that headwind but we\u2019re accomplishing our goals. John Stumpf : Let me just drill down a little bit on the expense side Erika, we operate within our 55% to 59% range on the efficiency ratio, which is, you know that's either at close to or at the top of our industry surely for our large bank peers, we\u2019ve spend a lot of money in the last couple of years around things like compliance and risk management and so forth. And as you build those, you spend more money, once you get into a rhythm there is an opportunity to get more eloquent, start to take some of those front end costs out and built it in as part of your process. John also mentioned that we continue to look to simplify our business to get more standard and frankly a lot of the investments we\u2019re making on customer service and consumer convenience has a front-end cost component but a back end benefit. So those things are all on the table, we can even look at those and in a lower-for-longer environment pennies and nickels and dimes matter. Erika Najarian : Got it. And as we think about balance sheet mix management near term, I'm wondering if, you know, I guess what it would take to may be extend even more aggressively extend duration and protect the margin near term or you're not going to manage your asset and liabilities based on sort of the market is thinking about the curve near term. John Stumpf : So it's a good question, and the things that we're balancing are - and readjusting constantly are expectation for what rates are going to do next and whether today is a better or worse entry point then waiting a quarter or waiting longer. We\u2019re balancing the capital sensitivity and what happens when you meaningfully add duration at what might be a cyclically low point in rates, we\u2019re saying we think it's going to be lower for longer but we have to sensitize ourselves to what happens if we get much more invested here and rates move up and that destroys capital. So that's a limiter in some sense. And then we've got our liquidity constraints of how we might deploy what we might use and what it means in terms of available liquidity. So it's a delicate balance going on all the time, but I would say that we\u2019re relatively convinced that we may not be this low forever but like we said a year ago our expectation is lower-for-longer at the curve and we're going to keep putting money to work. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : This is going to be a very short-term specific question but it will save us work later today. So, you had a $290 million gain on the sale of the health benefits services that added I guess about $0.04, so if we strip out that $0.04 from your dollar one it would mean you fell short of consensus. Are there any other items and expenses are anywhere else that might have mitigated that gain, in other words, when you look at the results, do you think they met consensus and if so, what offset that $0.04 gain? John Stumpf : I don't create a detailed reconciliation back to the consensus versus our numbers. We\u2019re looking at the total output every quarter we got a laundry list of things that might be seasonal that might be episodic, it could be gains from securities portfolio, we\u2019ve been selling a handful of non-core businesses and some of them have given rise to gains. So there isn\u2019t that type of reconciliation, I would look at those categories of revenue that come through and look at the multi-quarter, the five quarter average and think about how far above or below we are at any quarter versus that longer term average and model it or manage it that way. Mike Mayo : Could you give us some of your laundry list? John Stumpf : Some of our laundry list? Mike Mayo : Yes, like what we just\u2026 John Stumpf : But my laundry list is what you guys see back which are market sensitive items that you often call out as unreliably different from quarter to quarter, some of the mortgage activity which can be a little bit more episodic, mortgage hedging activity, this is what some analysts refer to as things that they have a hard time modeling, I mentioned gains on the sale of debt or equity securities. There are seasonal impacts on things like investment banking fees that happened at certain times, all of those things ebb and flow. And I would look at the longer term either calendar adjusted or multi-quarter averages and think about it that way. Mike Mayo : All right, and then just one more follow-up then just, when you look at mortgage revenues this quarter, where they where you thought they\u2019d be and what you expect going ahead, you said the mortgage pipeline is up quite a bit? John Stumpf : I\u2019d say on the origination side where we expected them to be and as you heard, the pipeline is full, I think margins are in a good place and we anticipate having a good third quarter on the origination side. Our mortgage hedging results in the second quarter and the net economic impact of mortgage servicing was lower than for example the five quarter average, it was higher in the quarter before, so the difference is even more stark. But I think where - we think it is a great time to be the leader in the mortgage business right now because homes are selling and also because people are refinancing. So we are expecting good things. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead. Bill Carcache : We've seen loan growth outpacing deposit growth for several quarters at both Wells Fargo and the industry in general. In the post LCR world where HQLA levels are a factor, how high do you think we can expect loan to deposit ratios to rise and with loan growth continuing at a healthy clip, can you envision a scenario where competition for deposits begins to heat up among banks and basically it causes them to start raising rates possibly even before the Fed as competition for deposit intensifies, can you speak to that? John Shrewsberry : Well, I suppose it could, I think we're probably in the - at the higher end of the range of loan to deposit ratios ourselves in the high 70s I guess at this point. And of course there are a lot of other sources of liquidity that are coming in as a result - at least for G-SIBs as a result of TLAC et cetera and some reliable sources if non-deposit wholesale funding that are part of a healthy liability management mix. So, funding never really seems to be a problem. We've imagined frankly since LCR was first proposed that people would be competing for deposits, especially smaller firms who have less of a value proposition for customers and they really have to pay for deposits in order to attract them. And it really hasn\u2019t seem to come to pass. I don't know whether aggregate credit creation is outstripping aggregate deposit generation by so much that it's going to cause firms at the margin to raise prices, compete for deposits and drive up the cost for the rest of us, it could happen, we haven't seen it. What we\u2019re seeing among assets is a lot more things changing hands, so a big part of our loan growth are loans coming out of GE and coming onto our books and loans coming off of other people's books and onto our books and as opposed to the aggregates being impacted in the way that you describe. John Stumpf : Bill, [indiscernible] I don't know this, but my guess is aggregate credit generation in the private sector, forget public debt for a second here, but I doubt that that\u2019s growing faster than deposits. I look at the last seven, eight years here since our merger our Wachovia, the time of the merger we had something less than $800 billion of deposits, now we are over $1.2 trillion, we've grown deposits even after run-off of those high-priced CDs by $400 billion or $500 billion, we\u2019re up maybe $100 billion on loans during that period of time, so deposits are far outstripped loans in fact, if you believe lower-for-longer there is going to be a hunger for earning assets. And while our quarter two might look different recently, if we look at, in our last year, the growth of $51 billion of deposits versus $80 billion of loans if you strip out some of the loans that we purchased, if you look on organic basis we\u2019re still growing deposits faster. So it's - I would - I doubt, I don't see pressure from that perspective. Bill Carcache : That's great colour, thank you. If I could ask a follow-up on the consumer credit side of your business. How do you think about the appropriate level of reserve coverage in auto and card, and do you think the current environment is supportive of a path where charge offs and reserves in those businesses can grow on-line with loans such that the consumer credit provision is not a headwind to your earnings growth. John Shrewsberry : It's a good question, and it will be different for every bank depending on what type of consumer credit they have on their books. As we mentioned, we added a little bit to our allowance this quarter and in part it was from consumer credit but that's based on the growth in the portfolio not because of any meaningful change in underlying behavior. My sense is that if those loans are priced properly for their risk and given the way that we provide for them as those portfolios grow that it shouldn't become too much of a headwind. Now we've said earlier that we are happy to provide more reserve more allowance when we\u2019re growing our loan portfolio that\u2019s because it was going to happen as we came out of the period of releases and are moving into a period of net provisioning and growth. But it's going to feel different for everybody based on the quality of the loans that they put on their books based on the pricing related to the quality of the loans they put on their books, so it's hard to generalize. I think we - I think we feel pretty good about it. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : John just a follow up on the credit, the charge off rate was pretty stable quarter to quarter, just wondering underneath that are there any areas of credit portfolios were losses are still improving and some that are starting to normalize and do you have kind of short-term outlook on credit staying stable to benign? John Shrewsberry : If you set aside oil and gas for a moment from our aggregate results, I think our net charge offs were something like 28 basis points on the portfolio overall just for analytical purposes that's an interesting number that would suggest that they\u2019ve continued to improve, obviously 39 basis points when considering oil and gas. I think it's a reasonable expectation that consumer credit performance normalizes somewhat so that we\u2019ve had the best of times, it probably gets a little bit more average while things being equal. As Bill asked, I don't know if that makes it a real headwind, I think that means the expected case is probably a little bit lower ROI than the existing case for most people who have been benefiting from the best of times in credit but not so meaningfully that it causes us to want to curtail growth based on the way we approach the market, as I mentioned we are happy with our auto growth, we\u2019ve maintained our pricing and our risk discipline. John Stumpf : And John, the 28 basis points John just mentioned to you, there is a lot of Johns here, but for this quarter ex-oil and gas is equal to what it was a year ago. So there is some movement within those categories but as you know housing is getting better everywhere and that hugely benefits us. So while there might be some more normalization in one part of the consumer, it might be offset by another part of the consumer. John Shrewsberry : Couple of callouts are on the consumer real estate side of things. In second mortgages, I think we're down below 50 basis points of charge-offs, which for home equity loans is, it can't get much better than that. And on one to four family first mortgage loans, I think we're in the 2 basis point charge-off range right now, which is something let\u2019s celebrate when it's happening, but it doesn't feel like a permanent state of affairs. John McDonald : Okay. And then a quick follow-up on net interest income. Assuming the rate environment doesn't change much, can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes for growing net interest income, maybe size up the degree of difficulty of growing that going forward? And then just on the liquidity cash on the balance sheet, when we look at that Fed funds sold like roughly 300 billion, is there any way for us to kind of get a sense of how much of that might be redeployable versus how much is needed to meet the requirements of LCR and other kind of regulatory needs to hold liquidity? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So there is not much limitation on the redeployment of that into HQLA, while still satisfying the liquidity coverage ratio. So it really gets back to the, when is the right time and how much at that time, if you\u2019re, just for example, buying treasuries because of the capital implications that it creates by putting more AFS securities on the books. You're that much more exposed to a backup. So there is a trade-off there. For non-HQLA, the limitations are different because you are losing the benefit of that liquidity and we've continued to mention the ability to move out of cash or HQLA into risk assets, all things being equal, based on a snapshot as tens of billions of dollars of activity.  You saw what we did last year when we, or earlier this year as we were sizing up taking GE assets on to our books. We actually went out and did a little bit of incremental funding in the marketplace to have that liquidity set aside and that we\u2019re allowing that to run off, it was relatively short-term, but it makes sense for us to have ready access to something, some, call it, $200 billion worth of instant liquidity at any point in time. That said, given our size, given our risk profile and given our stress cases. Is that helpful? John McDonald : Yeah. Thanks, John. And just the broader comment about just kind of degree of difficulty growing NII overall in this environment? Yeah. Thanks John Shrewsberry : Yes. Well, it is harder to grow net interest income in a lower rate environment than otherwise, which is obvious. The short end of the curve is one thing, but this move down in seven years and out, is just as hard and just as meaningful because of the redeployment. So it\u2019s still our plan and our goal and what we\u2019re telling you is that we intend to grow net interest income, even if there are no rate moves and we're doing it by adding -- by redeploying cash into HQLA and other earning assets, by looking everywhere for customers where we can make quality loans and those are the big items. So it's our plan, it's our effort, it's what we\u2019re all working toward, but it\u2019s harder. John Stumpf : And John, the biggest influence that Brexit had on our company was not on, frankly, a direct impact on the way we do business or customer strengthen like that, it really was the big move down in long-term rates. John Shrewsberry : One other thing to say is, it's a great time to be a borrower, it's a great time to be one of our customers. The mortgage business is one obvious place to look for the origination fee generation or gain generation, but across the board, I would expect more, everything is more affordable on a finance basis. So it helps. John McDonald : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Kevin Barker : Thank you. In regards to your servicing results within the mortgage bank, were there any changes in the way you\u2019ve hedged that asset this quarter or was there something just specific around the rate curve and the movement in the yield curve in the second quarter versus the first quarter that would have caused the hedging gains to be less than expected? John Shrewsberry : Yes. It's a good question. There wasn't really any change to the hedging approach and our hedging results, strictly speaking, accomplished what they were intended to. There were a handful of items that went, call it, in our favor in the first quarter that were negatives in the second quarter and some of them are just model inputs in terms of how the MSR valuation calculation works. Some of it obviously was just lower servicing fees, that's not a hedging outcome, but it contributed to the net servicing, net servicing benefits, things have speeded up. Of course, we\u2019re getting more servicing calls away from us, even as we originated this pace, there is more servicing getting called away from us as others originate rapidly as well. So I would expect that to normalize and I would think about that also as something more along the lines of a multi-quarter average. One other item I\u2019d point out is that the unreimbursed servicing costs was a net drag, an incremental net drag this quarter as well. And that's mostly around FHA activity. Kevin Barker : In regards to the FHA activity, what is the headwind that you\u2019re seeing from unreimbursed insurance claims this quarter or how would you look at it, like the run rate from that line item? John Stumpf : Well, I think we're talking about a couple of hundred million dollars of unreimbursed direct costs in the second quarter and the run rate is probably half of that, looking back over the last several quarters. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then in regards to the introduction of your first mortgage, have you seen an incremental increase in your overall mortgage originations from the introduction of that product or would you expect that to accelerate on a go forward basis? John Shrewsberry : Well, so, there is an increase, all things being equal, on the agency side of things, but many of those borrowers might have been FHA eligible borrowers prior to the introduction of that program. So in some sense, we\u2019re shifting origination from one program to another. It\u2019s -- we think it\u2019s a very high-quality program. It\u2019s -- the way we've described it and constructed it, it's never worse for a customer, it's often better for a customer because it's got a different approach to MI. That's more borrower friendly. So there should be more availability for it and it should help grow originations over time. And as we mentioned, it's particularly valuable to us because it gives access to mortgage credit to low and middle income borrowers and first-time home buyers, who are people that we\u2019re really trying to serve. Kevin Barker : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead. Paul Miller : Yes. On the follow-up to Kevin's questions on your first mortgage, is this very similar to what FHA product, but outside of the FHA, [indiscernible] low FICO, low down payment type loans? John Stumpf : Well, it\u2019s lower down payment. Actually, the first part of your question is, this is an agency program, this is a Wells Fargo and Fannie program. It is geared to serve the first-time homebuyer and the low and middle income homebuyer. So there is some overlap with people that the FHA might be serving as I mentioned, and it is built around a lower initial down payment to make it easier for those people to access credit. I wouldn't describe it as a predominantly as a lower FICO or lower credit quality, but more of structured for people who have lower down payment available. John Shrewsberry : And Paul, it really looks at those first-time homebuyers especially, so it really looks to serve that market. Many times have a lower down payment available. Paul Miller : And this product will be sold or ran by Fannie Mae guaranteed? John Stumpf : It's agency modest production, so it doesn't look any different in our books, it goes right into agency security. So there is no different risk profile on our books, and frankly one of the reasons that the program makes so much sense for us is because we have such a commercial relationship with Fannie in terms of knowing what our risks are, what their risks are and when those risks pass and that's very helpful. Paul Miller : Okay. And I don't know if you disclosed this or not, but do you guys know what you are recapture rate is on your refis right now on your book? You have one of the biggest books out there and there are MSR, are you able to recapture a lot of those refis? John Shrewsberry : So we do capture a lot of our refis, we don't think we've disclosed the capture rate. We probably do disclose our market share, both in origination and in servicing. I don't have them at my fingertips, but we\u2019ll come back to you with the most recent specifics and that relationship will help you to, I mean, there is obviously other things going on there, because a lot of mortgage origination is not refi activity. But, it might be helpful. Paul Miller : Hey, guys. Thank you very much. John Stumpf : Paul, just one quick thing, we are recapturing less today as John mentioned because some products, we\u2019re no longer in, so some of that refinances is refinancing away from us where we would have captured more in the past, some of the high-risk categories. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. To follow up on expenses, a lot of talk earlier about the investment spend, the risk, the compliance, obviously growth areas and then eventually getting the payback on that. As we think about just the pace of investment spend and that relationship of kind of getting it back on the other side, what inning are we in, in terms of still ramping on the investment and still waiting on the payoff? John Stumpf : Well, I\u2019d say we\u2019re in the middle innings of the investment. We\u2019ve been doing it for a few years and we\u2019ll be doing it for a few more years I\u2019m sure, and we will always be innovating. But in some cases, we\u2019re getting the payback. You saw at Investor Day, the moves that we made toward more of a paperless store and we talked about the specifics in terms of what the benefit is of taking paper, labor, storage, transportation out of stores. That\u2019s happened, that\u2019s in our run rate. A lot of the digital and mobile migration that we have of customer activity is taking personal interactions out of those types of transactions, it's taking paper out for sure. And those benefits feed right into the run rate as they happen.  John was mentioning the initial investment and build to create some of these new programs and compliance and risk management for example and the fact that once they are highly effective and repeatable, then there is an opportunity to automate, to streamline, to learn from how we got there and to make them more efficient. I\u2019d say those opportunities are, we\u2019re always learning, but they\u2019re probably a little bit more in the future. And then, who knows where we\u2019ll be going with the increase in mobility, et cetera, my sense is, we\u2019re just going to keep benefiting. Customers benefit on the one hand, but from an expense perspective, we will keep benefiting as well. I\u2019d point out the P2P activity as another place where we're taking checks out, taking cash handling out, increasing customer service, but doing it at a lower cost to serve. So there is a lot of that. Matt O'Connor: Are you still at a point where you\u2019re increasing overall investment spend or are you able to remix some of it so that it\u2019s still at a high level, but not necessarily going up? John Stumpf : I think it\u2019s still going up a little bit. We've been doing that while taking expense out of our standard run rate in order to accommodate it, while staying within our 55 to 59. So, and as the nature of mobile first and technological solutions first occurs, we\u2019re always going to be spending at a high level. We\u2019ll just keep at least for innovative types of activity. I think we will keep doing what we're doing, taking expense out of our business as usual. Matt O'Connor: And then just separately, you mentioned in the press release about the higher amortization on the mortgage bond book, which makes sense, given the sharp drop in the rate, but do you have the figures in terms of how much it was this quarter versus last and remind us how your strategy or approach there is, is there like a mark to marking or is there a smoothing effect, one of your peers has, what feels like a mark-to-market impact, they take their head upfront, some of the peers do that a little bit more, remind us how your approach is? John Stumpf : Yes. What I would point out is that we\u2019re amortizing premiums on mortgage securities in particular that are highly prepayment sensitive and in this quarter, the net interest margin or net interest dollars negative impact of getting premium book value bonds called away at par was, I think the number is $100 million. I\u2019m confirming, it\u2019s $100 million. So that's one way of thinking about it. So we put a mortgage security on at a premium, we amortize that premium over an expected life and an expected CPR, things come in faster and we have to write off the remaining premium when it happens. This quarter, that impact was $100 million. Matt O'Connor: Do you have that for last quarter? John Stumpf : I don't think I do handy, but it wasn\u2019t $100 million, so less. Matt O'Connor: Got it. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Brian Foran : Hi, how are you. Maybe just two quick ones on credit. First in auto lending, you mentioned the Mannheim is up a little bit, but severities are up a little bit as well. What\u2019s driving that, I know it\u2019s not a huge number, but what\u2019s driving that disconnect? John Stumpf : Mannheim is up a little bit. It was up in each of the last few months and I think as we\u2019ve said, there is an expectation that that can't go on forever, and that's part of why we would say that we expect future losses to be a little bit more normal in that business than what's been happening. Any change in severity is really just the change in the mix, the repo activity, the circumstances of what's been coming in. I don\u2019t think there is a systematic reason for it. John Shrewsberry : Brian, I would just add that it's been a really strong new car sales the last couple of years. Some of those go out and lease programs and they come off leased. So our guess is that there will be more late-model used cars on the market, put pressure on Mannheim, but on the other hand, which could cost them normalization in losses. On the other hand, that's really where we play and where we have a lot of market expertise. So it\u2019s a bit of an offset. Brian Foran : Thank you. And then on commercial real estate, I mean, I guess let\u2019s think about both your commentary and data as well as like what the OCC is saying, et cetera, there is just kind of general concern around underwriting standards, but at the same time, the current data around loan growth is pretty good and on charge-offs, kind of bouncing between zero and net recovery. So it's about as good as it can get. How are you thinking about the commercial real estate cycle now? Is it just kind of pockets of concern or is there a concern that there is maybe a more broad-based turn on the horizon or how do you kind of think about the concerns around underwriting standards versus the very good numbers today? John Stumpf : Yes. So I would say that our underwriting approach to commercial real estate tends to be at the conservative end of the spectrum and we have a reputation often for better, sometimes customers to the [indiscernible] which helps us well through cycles as you are alluding to, this is a very cyclical business. It is regional and local, it is property type by property type. There are some areas and some property types where values have been elevated because people have been willing to accept really, really low returns on their invested capital. And that's, that creates one sort of outcome and then there are others whether it\u2019s just a lot of supply that's coming on, has come on, has to be absorbed, that creates a different dynamic. We have seen that in some multi-family or luxury single-family from market to market and in that market, those dynamics have to play out where that gets absorbed at some clearing price. We\u2019re taking the same approach that we always have. We\u2019re sort of a relatively low loan to value lender. We look very hard at in place cash flow. We have a lot of incremental borrower guarantees and supplemental protections on our bigger commercial real estate types of financings and it's always been true. So I'm sure when the cycle turns, it will be either property types or geographies where they do better or worse, but we are not taking a big change, we're not seeing a big sea change, our originations have actually -- have been slower, certainly very slower before we bought the season's GE portfolio, the organic activity because of the competitive environment and because of the market circumstances caused us to slow down somewhat. Brian Foran : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. A question on the investment portfolio. John, you had mentioned that you had added a lot of securities this quarter before the rates changed and it looks like you did it mostly in the agency MBS and the held to maturity and I was just wondering given that it looks like that average yield was 190 or below, given that's where the averages are, how are you thinking about continuing to build the security's book versus potentially keeping more of your originated prediction where you can get free handle sale versus maybe 1.5 in the security\u2019s books, so what's your trade-off on interest rate risk versus credit risk I guess, and does your philosophy change, given where we are in the environment at all? John Stumpf : Yes. It's a good question and it\u2019s analysis that we conduct. As I mentioned earlier, we've been continuing to sell all of our confirming production. There are limited, but some benefits, limited liquidity attribution, but some benefit to agency mortgage securities, but less so or not so with loans. So that\u2019s part of that determination. There is different risk profile for carrying loans on the books obviously versus guaranteed pass throughs, that's part of the analysis. We have a reasonably large allocation to single-family home loan real estate -- residential real estate today because of our jumbo portfolio, which we continue to want to make room for as we serve those customers going forward. So all those things sort of fit together in our risk appetite and have setting the ALCO considerations aside, but just from how much is enough and what type of risk do you need on your books, we\u2019ve followed the path that we\u2019ve followed, which isn't to say that if circumstances changed or persisted and the allocation opportunities look a little bit different, we wouldn't modify our conclusion, but that's where we've gotten thus far. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then just second question on commercial real estate brokerage, just within the other fees category, it's been a good business for you historically. It looks like it's gotten a little softer, is that purposeful change in how you\u2019re doing the business or is it just the environment, any color there will be great? John Stumpf : It\u2019s cyclical, it's a great business for us. We\u2019re the best frankly in that business and there is a lot of knock-on benefit in terms of the financing that we do, investment banking that we do for those customers, but it is cyclical and it'll follow patterns like the ones that we just talked about in terms of what's going on in different markets. That business is interesting, because it's got something for bullish times in commercial real estate, and it's got something for bearish times in commercial real estate, because the same team is involved in helping define liquidity for properties and financing for properties when things aren\u2019t going well in markets and when investors are going the other way. So we like it, but it's a little bit harder to forecast, because it doesn't just trend up over time, it moves around, but it's been a great performer for the last couple of years. Ken Usdin : So, there is no change in terms of how you are approaching it, it's just a little bit of an air pocket? John Stumpf : It's just the normal volatility and what's happening in that business, no change. Ken Usdin : Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Morford : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. The C&I growth seemed a bit softer this quarter, particularly relative to the pace you saw through much of last year. And is there anything to that, besides maybe some impact from energy and just how in general do you feel business owner confidence is these days, particularly given some of the uncertainties like Brexit and the upcoming election? John Shrewsberry : I'm not sure what would inspire marginal business owner confidence in this environment. I mean, it's about the same as it has been recently, probably a little bit less certainty, given what's going on around the world. But I don't think of that as having a meaningful impact on the quarter\u2019s organic C&I loan growth. It\u2019s competitive and we\u2019re out there competing. There is some amount of capital formation around CapEx and expansion in other projects, not as much as there would be, if we were in a more vibrant overall economic environment. There is actually a little more happening in energy today than there was over the last several quarters, more capital being raised, more assets are changing here, just giving rise to some financing opportunities. So I would think of it more as a season or a short period of time to measure against. Joe Morford : Okay. And then you also talked earlier about being disciplined on expenses and getting paper and transactions out of the stores, but more broadly speaking, how are you currently thinking about the overall retail distribution network, particularly given the growth in mobile banking, considering moving more aggressively or transitioning to the smaller neighborhood stores, or perhaps maybe don't need as much density in certain markets, it can reduce the overall footprint. What's the update there? John Stumpf : Yes. Joe, I think that's an interesting question. We continue to look at that and we\u2019re not oblivious to the changes going on as you suggest. The mobile offerings are fastest-growing channel now, 18 million of our 20 some million households now have used that and sometimes -- most times as their dominant channel. So we continue to think about that. Our philosophy has been or will continue to be, we want to serve customers when, where and how they want to be served. We don't want to drive them some place to our benefit. We want to provide for their benefit. That being said, that's a big area of, we continue to look at as we innovate and we see customers change their behaviors. John Shrewsberry : We\u2019re going to make it easier for them to do business with us in other channels as well. And if they change their behavior, then we will react to that. John Stumpf : We\u2019ll react to it and those could have some meaningful impacts on it. Joe Morford : Right. Okay, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. I\u2019ll try to be quick, given the length of the call here, but I'm going to beat the dead horse here on the expense topic, but I know and I appreciate the color you gave on the leverage that you can pull given what we\u2019re seeing on the top line side here. Now, what I'm trying to just understand is, like, what do we need to see maybe it\u2019s in terms of where rates go or overall top line pressure, for you to start to really pull those levers more aggressively and again, maybe it's around expenses, and also longer term, is the goal just to keep the efficiency ratio, are you okay with that high-end of that range, even through \u201917, if this topline pressure persists from the curve, or do you at some point look to get to the middle of that range again? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Here is how we look at expenses. We look at this company, in fact, on Wednesday, we had our 164th birthday and we look at this company from a long-term perspective, we've always been thoughtful about how we spend our shareholders money. We\u2019re the stewards of your capital and their capital and surely a longer -- lower for longer scenario puts pressure on everything that we do, but we\u2019re going to continue to make those investments that we believe are good long-term investments to help customers succeed financially.  That being said, I do think we\u2019re at a point in time where there are some opportunities that because of changing customer behaviors, so we will, but we\u2019re not going to do something that's going to be short-term bright and long-term dull if you will, just because of pressure on the revenue side or the earnings side. Just assume that we\u2019re going to continue to work really hard on making investments and also maturing systems, taking out costs that don't add value. In other words, think of maximizing or monetizing our scale. John Pancari : Got it. Thanks, John. And then if rates, if we only see another 25 basis points next year and that's it, is it fair to assume that you are in that upper range still of the efficiency ratio? John Shrewsberry : I think we probably are. Yeah, which still is a world-class range and don't take for granted how hard one has to work to operate at 58% efficiency ratio. There is a lot that has to happen to stay there, while we\u2019re spending the money that we\u2019re spending to innovate and improve ourselves from a compliance risk management and other perspective. John Pancari : Completely understood. All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks. One narrow question and perhaps one broader one. On your servicing income and I'm looking at the data on page 40 of the release, your servicing fees are down year-over-year by order of magnitude, something like 20%, but your servicing portfolio is only down about 3%. What's the dynamic there on the servicing income? John Shrewsberry : So there are older categories of loan products that are running off that might have different per pound fees associated with them, there is different categories of unreimbursed servicing expense that get netted against those servicing fees, and I mentioned, we are up $100 million I think in this quarter, which contributes to the delta between last year and this year, a quarter -- a year ago in this quarter. But the servicing book has been getting smaller, as we\u2019ve walked away from higher risk activities, et cetera and focused more on today\u2019s score agency mortgage origination. So that phenomena is something to grapple with when thinking about how that performs over the coming couple of years. As augmented by how successful we are, and on the origination side, and growing new servicing assets as well. Eric Wasserstrom : But does the pace of change, I guess does the pace of change, change at all, because of the presumably many of the legacy assets are now being refied away and newer assets may look more like legacy assets in terms of servicing rate? John Shrewsberry : Well, I think what changes is the cost to service because we\u2019re working through the, we've had higher foreclosed and workout expenses over time. There is labor, there is extra compliance, there's a lot going on. The standards are still -- the new standards are as high as they've ever been, but the incidence will be going down over time. So my sense is that that should improve. There should be some scale there. And perhaps it's true also that the per pound revenue -- per loan revenue scales into today's run rate and with each new million dollars\u2019 worth of servicing that we add to the book, it doesn't pay the same servicing revenue as the legacy billion dollars. But you will watch that move slowly over time. Eric Wasserstrom : And then if I can just step back for a moment, your earnings power for the past several years now has been running just above $4 and of course this current quarter, it\u2019s sort of affirm that run rate and the consensus for next year is closer to $4.30 and I'm not asking to specifically forecast, but could you help us understand like what bridges that increase in earnings power, presumably rates might be some of it, but is there and the balance sheet continues to grow, but in the absence of rates, would that figure be achievable or are we more in a trend line? John Shrewsberry : Well, there is a lot of unknowns in that question and we\u2019re not giving guidance on next year. But as was mentioned earlier by Erika in terms of what might happen or what has to happen, as we grow in the future, it will be earning asset growth, loans and investments, it will be how efficient we are on the expense side of things and then the whole spectrum of non-interest income generating possibilities. There is a lot of strength in the number of those line items. Yeah. The GE portfolio added, not just 40 odd billion dollars worth of loans, but over 200,000 commercial relationships, most of whom weren't meaningful relationships at Wells Fargo already. So it's doing more with customers and generating more lending opportunity, more non-interest income opportunity and executing along those lines. So lot of work. John Stumpf : But if you think about the way we do business and our operating model, it's a great model to have for this economic environment, really when you think about it, we are the real economy. We do have 90 different businesses. We serve customers broadly and deeply and I don't think I\u2019d want any other model for this environment. Yeah. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks for taking the question. John, what I wanted to kind of drill down to is if you think about mortgage refinance, the way you\u2019ve got the accounting setup where you recognized at close and the way that servicing valuations get hit almost instantaneously when rates fall, you typically have a pressure quarter when refinance kicks in, followed by more favorable outcomes as you move forward. So I just [Technical Difficulty] And then the only thing I was going to add and follow up is if you think about what you were just responding to the one thing that I think you left out was the fact that share repurchase will reduce the shares outstanding by about half of that growth that was just highlighted. So capital announcements has a big part of what would generate any incremental growth, as if net income was absolutely flat from this point forward. John Stumpf : We have been benefiting and we\u2019ll continue to benefit from taking share repurchase as a result of our capital plan. It is a driver for people who are measuring in earnings per share. Thanks for pointing that out. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning, guys. At least, I think it\u2019s still mourning. Anyway, one larger question and two small ones. The commentary on the oil and gas portfolio and the trends there. It seems to be a little bit different than what we heard from JP Morgan Chase yesterday and US Bancorp earlier this morning where they seem to be a little less equivocal in the trends and it looks like you had a big addition to non-accruals, but you didn\u2019t add to the reserve for the portfolio. Yesterday, James Dimon talked about the companies and their portfolio having greater access to other financing. That seemed to be your trends or commentary was a little different than that. Can you just, I mean are there differences in your oil and gas portfolio or you're just being cautious here? John Stumpf : I'd say both. There are probably differences. We have a big broad spectrum of upstream midstream and services companies that includes a lot of middle market companies, which our entire wholesale portfolio does. So the portfolios are probably different. We are generally cautious, however. I guess I\u2019d point out that our criticized assets in some, in energy are down by $1.7 billion. Within that, we moved more into non-performing in the quarter, which we had expected to do in our outlook as we sat here a quarter ago, which is why our reserve didn\u2019t have to go up in connection with that.  I think we\u2019re just a little -- it\u2019s a little premature to declare victory because prices are hovering in crude in the 40s and who knows what the next couple of quarters brings and we don't want to get ahead of ourselves there. We\u2019re performing great with 39 basis points of loss, all in with these levels, and so there is no point in declaring victory. We would agree, if I didn't mention, it was an oversight, there is a lot more access to capital among energy companies today, all forms, loans, high yield, high-grade and equity were busier in the second quarter than it have been in a while. There are more assets changing here, and things are freeing up a little bit and that's going to help with resolutions and we\u2019ve captured the benefit of that in our analysis for what our exposures are, but it\u2019s true and it was less true a couple of quarters ago. John Shrewsberry : And Nancy, the other thing, John mentioned, but I just want a reminder or say it again, even though we added to our non-accruals, we tend to be conservative. Over 90% of our non-accrual oil and gas customers are still current on principal and interest payments, think about that. I mean, that's\u2026 John Stumpf : Almost all the losses that we\u2019ve taken are from loans that are still paying. Nancy Bush : Okay. So we are sort of targeting back to the performing non-performing era of a couple of decades ago. John Stumpf : Yes. Nancy Bush : I remember. Secondly, mortgage banking gain on sale, can you just give us the current margin and how that stacks up and if it\u2019s strengthening, I mean if refi activity goes up, I'm assuming that gain on sale margin will strengthen, can you just affirm that or not? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So it was sort of 165, 166 in the quarter and about the same from the first quarter. I think you're right that the industry is probably going to have some capacity constraints at this level of application activity and that's probably, it\u2019s at least supportive for levels that we are today. I don\u2019t know if it moves up from here, but it feels supportive because people are working hard to accomplish the throughput that these applications create. Nancy Bush : Okay. And just one final question, John Stumpf, you raised the dividend, what $0.02 I guess what last quarter, and you\u2019re sort of at the 37% payout ratio, et cetera, et cetera. When would be the next regular dividend meeting where you would consider a more meaningful dividend increase and given that your stock is one of the highest yielding in the group, is that necessary at this point? John Stumpf : Well, we increased $0.05, right from $0.375 to $0.38 and I would remind as John did that and you just suggested that if you take $0.38 and divide that by $1.1, you get a number that is that we're proud about. We just went through our CCAR process and I hope you would agree and I know our investors appreciate the fact that we are shareholder friendly. We have -- of the big banks. We are a leader in returning capital. So dividends are important, speaks to the confidence of our -- of how we run the company and the earnings momentum that we have. On the other hand, buybacks are also important. So they\u2019re both in there and the question you asked, we think about that a lot. So, and we will continue to put all of our emphasis on running a really great business and returning as much capital as we can and we should -- and people should think about the 55% to 75% range. Nancy Bush : Thanks for the artful non-answer, John. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. Just a quick question. When you look at the balance sheet, when you look at the kind of, on the liability side of the balance sheet, if you look at it year-on-year, you\u2019ve seen deposits up 60 billion, where most of the fundings come from short-term borrowings and long-term debt. So is there something changing in the depositor base or depositor is becoming more rate sensitive and that's why you\u2019re not seeing the deposit growth that you once were, especially this quarter where it\u2019s only been 4 billion on end of period for total deposits, just wondering if there is a change in the depositor. John Shrewsberry : Yes. If there is anything specific, I would say it\u2019s among wholesale customers, I think retail deposits grew by 8% year-over-year and the total grew by 4% and the balance is coming from wholesale customers who are a little bit more price sensitive and in the wake of the 25 basis point move in December, there are some deposits that we paid a little bit more for in wholesale and some that we didn't, and some that have better liquidity value and some that have worse and this is how that\u2019s shaken out.  You pointed out that there has been some more wholesale funding on the liability side. We went out and put on some short-ish term, I think it shows up as long-term, because it's beyond the year, but short-ish term financing to make sure we had funding in place for the GES, as they came on, some of that will roll off, some of it might hang on too for a while. But it\u2019s a mix. And then as you also pointed out, we are out there marching along the TLAC implementation path and we will be over the course of the next several years, and that will add to that portion of the liability stack. John Stumpf : Brian, we love all of our deposits and depositors, but if you look at as John mentioned, if you look at the most core of our core deposits, that would be retail and especially retail transaction deposits, savings accounts, checking accounts and if you look at our net primary, which where people live out of those accounts, you look at that growth and you look at the growth on the retail side, it's been world-class for us and that continues to march along. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great. Thanks. John Stumpf : Thank you. I know we ran over, but I want to thank all of you for joining us today and your interest in Wells Fargo and your questions. So, and also I want to thank all of our 265,000 plus team members for a great quarter. Thank you much. See you next quarter. Bye-bye. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo third quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin the conference. Jim Rowe : Thank you, Regina. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our President and CEO, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at WellsFargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn the call over to President and CEO, Tim Sloan. Timothy Sloan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. And thank you all for joining us today. A lot has happened since our last earnings call. So our formal presentation this morning will be a little bit longer than usual. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our financial performance in the third quarter, and John Shrewsberry will be discussing those results more in a few minutes. But I\u2019d like to focus on the events of the past few weeks and the impact on our company. This week, John Stumpf announced that he was retiring from Wells Fargo and the Board. He made this decision because he believed his leadership had become a distraction, and therefore the best thing for Wells Fargo was for him to retire. This action demonstrates the dedication John has had to Wells Fargo throughout his 34 years with the company, including successfully leading us through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history. As the new CEO, my immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo. As you know, on September 8, we announced settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Los Angeles city attorney related to sales practices in retail banking. I know that this is not the type of activity you expect from Wells Fargo and is certainly not what we expect from ourselves. We let down our customers, our shareholders, and our team members. We simply failed to fulfill our responsibility to all our stakeholders. Our vision of satisfying our customers\u2019 financial needs and helping them to succeed financially is about building lifelong relationships one customer at a time. The core values of Wells Fargo are as true today as they were a month ago, a year ago, and 164 years ago. However, we had serious problems in our retail bank where products became the focus rather than the relationships with our customers. Our senior management could have and should have done more. I'm fully committed along with the entire leadership team to fixing these issues and taking the necessary actions to restore our customers\u2019 trust. We have a specific action plan in place to lead our company forward during this period, which is focused on outreach to everyone who has been impacted by retail banking sales practices, including our customers, our team members, our investors, our regulators, elected officials, and the communities that we do business in. It includes being transparent in our communication, and we've included a lot of information in this quarterly supplement for you. On pages three and four, we provide some background regarding the sales practices settlements, along with details of the account review that was completed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I believe most of these facts are familiar to you, but let me highlight a few key points. The 2.1 million consumer and small business accounts that were identified as accounts that may not have been authorized cost Wells Fargo much more than the $2.6 million of fees we received, which we have fully refunded. And let me clarify that these accounts had a de minimis impact to the retail banking household cross-sell ratio that we report on a quarterly basis with the maximum impact in any one quarter of 0.02 products per household or 0.3% of the reported metric. At no time were all of the identified accounts included in our reported cross-sell ratio, because unused deposit accounts rolled off. While the revenue generated was small relative to our annual income, and the impact on our cross-sell ratio was not material, the implications for our company and on the trust of our customers are significant. We\u2019ve made several changes to enhance our oversight, expand customer transparency, and improve the customer experience, which we highlight on page five. Effective October 1, we eliminated product sales goals for our retail banking team members; and next year, we will introduce a new performance plan based on updated metrics around customer service, growth, and risk management. We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right for our customers and the elimination of product sales goals has been positively received by both our team members and our customers. And we\u2019ve made system and process enhancements, including sending automated emails, application acknowledgments, and multifactor authentication. We expect to spend a total of over $50 million this year enhanced quality assurance monitoring. We\u2019ve implemented an independent third-party mystery shopper program targeting 15,000 to 20,000 annual visits to our branches to test actual product purchase interactions. We\u2019ve added risk professionals to provide greater oversight and significantly expanded our customer complaint servicing and resolution process. We will continue to invest in process enhancements and product monitoring, a proactive monitoring, and we\u2019re committed to getting it right for our customers. We\u2019re reaching out to all retail and small business checking, savings, credit card, and unsecured line of credit customers, and we\u2019re asking them to contact us if they have any concerns about their accounts or any aspect of the relationship with Wells Fargo. We've dedicated resources available 24/7 for inquiries and questions. In cases where customers believe they have received a product that they did not want or authorize and they are not satisfied with our resolution, we\u2019re providing an option of mediation through a third-party that is convenient and free for the customer. Our team members are proactively calling a meeting with their customers in all areas of the company. Additionally, we\u2019ve been working on contacting the credit card customers identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. As a reminder, their analysis included all credit cards that were open, but not activated. There are a lot of reasons why customers don't activate their cards, so we\u2019re trying to contact all unactivated credit card customers with open accounts to confirm whether they want their credit cards. For consumer credit card customers identified, over half have closed their accounts, in part reflecting the passage of time as some of these accounts were opened five years ago. For those accounts that are still open, we\u2019ve called 166,000 un-activated customers so far and we\u2019ve spoken with 34,000 customers who have made a decision whether to keep or close their account. Of those customers, 17% have said that they did not apply for a credit card and 8% said that they did not recall applying for a credit card. We\u2019re also focused on determining potential additional impacts that the identified consumer and small business deposit and credit card customers may have incurred. We\u2019ve allocated significant resources to this effort. We\u2019re contracting with a third-party firm to work with us as well as with the primary credit card bureaus to develop a plan for submission to the regulators for their approval. Here's what we've learned so far. According to FICO, the impact on FICO scores from a credit card application varies based on a person's unique credit history. But, in general, credit inquiries have a small impact on FICO scores. For most people, one additional credit inquiry will take fewer than five points off their FICO scores for a period of up to 12 months. We\u2019re working on determining potential financial impact for customers who obtained a loan with Wells Fargo or another company during the 12-month period where their FICO score may have been impacted by the credit inquiry. For example, if the loan was from Wells Fargo, and the customer was impacted by a lower FICO score, we will adjust the line size, modify pricing, and refund any additional costs incurred. As we did with our original account analysis, in all circumstances, our intent is to err on the side of the customer and to make it right. We've been actively monitoring and tracking our customer activity since the announcement. In order to be as transparent as possible, on page nine, we are providing data to compare activity levels across a number of metrics in retail banking. When analyzing these trends versus the prior month, it\u2019s important to remember that September had two fewer business days this year than August. While it is too early to determine the long-term impact, and we\u2019re prepared for things to get worse before they get better, here's what we\u2019ve observed so far. Our customer traffic to our branches and call centers remained at typical levels for September. Customers calling and speaking to a phone banker are up 4% from a year ago. And so far, formal complaints related to sales practices have been less than 1% of the calls we\u2019ve received. Historically, approximately 70% of banker interactions are service, not sales related, and this percentage increased slightly in September. Customer visits with bankers in our branches, a subset of overall customer traffic, were down 10% in September compared with a year ago. The lower level of interactions in September was driven by lower internal referrals, decreased product offerings and reduced marketing. We have begun to reintroduce marketing and will be gradually increasing our marketing efforts throughout the coming months. The drivers of lower banker interactions also resulted in new consumer checking account openings declining 25% in September compared with openings in September a year ago. To put this in perspective, account openings were down 143,000 from a year ago on a base of 33.2 million accounts. We continue to have year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, up 4.5% in September. As a reminder, primary checking customers are those who actively use their checking accounts and, therefore, this metric was not impacted by the accounts identified by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Our deposit customers continue to use their accounts with balances up $6.5 billion in September compared with August and debit card transactions up 9% from a year ago. Lower referrals, marketing and product offerings also impacted credit card applications, which were down 20% in September compared with September a year ago. Applications were down 77,000 from a year ago compared with 7.8 million total active cards. We continue to see increased usage among our customers with active cards up 9%, balances up 10%, and transaction volume also up 10% from a year ago. We are also actively monitoring customer experience scores with over 80,000 branch customer surveys completed in September. Loyalty scores in September were down from an all-time high in August, but were consistent with where they were as recently as two years ago. We also asked customers about the quality of their most recent branch visit. The score in September was down from August, but was also consistent with two years ago. Our enhanced focus on service seeks to bring these scores back to pre-settlement levels as we work to rebuild confidence and trust with our customers. We\u2019re also tracking the impact from the announcement on our other businesses, which we highlight on page ten. Mortgage referrals from retail banking, which account for 10% of our year-to-date mortgage originations, were down 24% from August to September. Auto originations have been minimally impacted since over 90% of our originations were through the indirect channel in the third quarter. We remain focused on maintaining our deep and long tenured dealer relationship, which drive most of our origination volume in our auto business. Within wholesale banking, our team members are actively meeting with customers and responding to their concerns. There have been a few state treasurers and municipalities who have made public announcements about temporarily suspending certain business activity with Wells Fargo, while several others have reaffirmed the relationship with us. Overall, we did not see any meaningful change of business trends in wholesale banking late in the quarter and deposit balances were up 4% during the month of September and loan pipelines were in line with the second quarter. We've also seen minimal impact so far within our wealth and investment management business. September-ending deposit balances were up 1% from August month-end and up 11% from a year ago. Client transaction activity was muted in September, but largely reflected the market environment. Retail brokerage advisory flows in September were strong, up $1.6 billion from August. September closed referred investment assets \u2013 these are the referrals resulting from the Wells community banking partnership \u2013 were more than $1 billion, in line with prior trends. But these referred assets are dependent on banker referrals, so we will be watching this trend very closely. We\u2019ve always believed that our team members are our most important asset. And it\u2019s been disturbing to hear claims of retaliations against team members who contacted the ethics line. We are investigating these claims. We are also assisting former team members who left retail banking due to sales performance and who remain eligible for rehire and applying for available positions at the company. Leaders throughout Wells Fargo have had ongoing regular outreach with their teams throughout our markets. Mary Mack, who was the new head of community banking, has met with team members in ten cities so far to gather ideas, concerns and questions from frontline retail managers at all levels to help inform the go-forward strategy for a service-driven community bank. Eight additional executive officers and their leadership teams met with more than 116,000 team members across the country. During these meetings, we\u2019re reinforcing our code of ethics, business conduct, ethics line and non-retaliation policies. We\u2019re also shifting our language in retail banking training and communications to make it more customer focused, less sales focused, and reinforcing our commitment to do what's right for our customers. We offer all of our team members competitive pay and benefits, which we highlight on slide 12. For example, tellers and customer service representatives earn at least $12 an hour, 60% above the federal minimum wage. 99% of team members are eligible for company-sponsored health benefits and our benefits programs cover more than 515,000 team members, spouses, domestic partners and their dependents. We believe that team member engagement is critical to our success. In each spring, our team members have the opportunity to take an anonymous survey administered through Gallup. It's a chance for our team members to share their perspective on what it's like to work at Wells Fargo. In 2016, over 90% of eligible team members participated in a survey and Wells Fargo's overall engagement scores were above 88% of the companies represented in Gallup's database. While we ranked high on the survey, this is not a mechanism \u2013 the only mechanism to identify team member concerns, like sales practices, and we\u2019re implementing other ways for our team members to share their views with management. Our team members are active in the communities where they live and work. And in 2015, the United Way ranked our workplace giving campaign the largest in the US for the seventh year in a row. We\u2019ve just finished our 2016 campaign last week. And during the time that has been very challenging for our company, our team members demonstrated their continued support for their communities. The preliminary contribution results are similar to last year. We\u2019re also committed to team member development. And last year, we invested $300 million in team member training in credit, risk, technology and customer service. Additionally, we provided $21 million in tuition reimbursement. As we move through this period, we will continue to be transparent regarding trends across the company. John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Our strong financial results in the third quarter were relatively straightforward. And in order to allow extra time to take questions, my prepared remarks regarding our results will be shorter than usual. I want to start on page 13 with a few key takeaways from our third quarter results, which reflect the benefit of our diversified business model and the momentum across many of our businesses. For the 16th consecutive quarter, we generated earnings of greater than $5 billion. Our loan, investment and deposit balances are all at record levels. Compared with the second quarter, we grew revenue driven by growth in net interest income. Many of our businesses had their best non-interest income results in five quarters, including strong mortgage banking results. We grew revenue despite equity gains being at five-quarter lows and $780 million lower than a year ago. Expense growth was driven by higher operating losses and the contribution to the Wells Fargo Foundation. Credit quality improved including lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio and our capital position remains strong as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders. Turning to page 15, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. I believe our balance sheet has never been stronger. We grew loans and deposits and our liquidity and capital remained strong. Our funding sources grew in the third quarter with long-term debt up $10.9 billion on $20 billion of issuances, including $9.2 billion that we anticipate will be TLAC eligible. We also had strong deposit growth, up $330.4 billion from the second quarter. We purchased $57 billion of securities during the quarter, primarily agency MBS in our available-for-sale portfolio. The amount of securities purchased was higher than in prior quarters, but wasn't outsize when factoring in that we did not add duration in the loan portfolio with interest rate swaps as we had in prior quarters. We remain asset sensitive and will benefit if rates increase. Turning to the income statement overview on page 16, revenue increased $166 million from second quarter, with net interest income up $219 million. The slight decline in non-interest income was driven by a $303 million reduction in market sensitive revenue, which is at its lowest level in the past five quarters and a decrease in other income reflecting the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business last quarter. The $402 million increase in expenses from second quarter was primarily driven by $243 million increase in operating losses on higher litigation accruals. We also had a $107 million contribution to the foundation during the quarter. I will provide more detail on expenses later on the call. As shown on page 17, loans grew 6% from a year ago and were up $4.1 billion from the second quarter. Commercial loans grew $1.9 billion from the second quarter on higher commercial real estate and C&I loans. Consumers loans were up $2.2 billion with growth in first mortgage loans, auto, credit cards, student lending and securities based lending. On page 18, we highlight year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio, but as you can see on this page, we had strong and broad-based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios. As highlighted on page 19, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the third quarter, up $62.6 billion or 5% from a year ago and included 8% growth in consumer and small business banking deposits. Our average deposit cost was stable with second quarter at 11 basis points and up 3 basis points from a year ago, reflecting an increase in deposit pricing for certain wholesale banking customers. Page 20 highlights our revenue diversification. Our results continued to benefit from our growth in earning assets and our diversified business model. Net interest income was up $219 million or 2% from the second quarter, reflecting earning asset growth and one additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin declined 4 basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by growth in long-term debt and deposits, partially offset by the benefit of earning asset growth. Net interest income grew 4% from a year ago, even with a 14 basis point reduction in NIM. Non-interest income declined $53 million from the second quarter, which included a $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business and declined $42 million from a year ago, which included $780 million of higher gains from equity investments. Across a number of our fee businesses, we had the best results in five quarters, including deposit accounts, trust and investment, mortgage banking and lease income. Our mortgage banking results reflected strong residential and commercial mortgage originations. Residential origination volume was $70 billion, up $15 billion or 27% from a year ago and up $7 billion from the second quarter, which is typically the strongest quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. Applications were up 5% from second quarter and we ended the third quarter with a $50 billion unclosed pipeline, the highest since second quarter of 2013. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgages was 181 basis points in the third quarter, up 15 basis points from the second quarter. Given our strong pipeline at the end of the third quarter, we currently expect origination volume in the fourth quarter to be up from a year ago, but down slightly from the third quarter due to seasonality in the purchase market. And we currently expect the production margin in the fourth quarter to be at or above the upper end of the range of the past five quarters, which was 188 basis points. As shown on page 23, expenses increased $402 million from the second quarter, driven by $243 million of higher operating losses, reflecting increased litigation accruals. Operating losses could continue to increase related to outstanding legal matters such as sales practice issues as we\u2019ve disclosed in our 10-K filing RMBS. $125 million in higher salaries due to an extra day in the quarter and FTE growth, $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation and higher FDIC insurance expense, reflecting the increase in deposit assessments. Expenses also reflected lower foreclosed asset expense from commercial foreclosed asset recoveries and lower commissions and incentive compensation expense reflecting the forfeiture of unvested equity awards from John Stumpf and Carrie Tolstedt. Our efficiency ratio was 59.4% in the third quarter and we expect the efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level. While our expenses increased this quarter, we remain focused on managing expenses while actively reinvesting in the franchise for future growth, which we highlight on page 24. We focused on reducing non-core businesses in order to simplify our organization and improve our risk profile. We\u2019re also working on creating a simpler and more collaborative way to seamlessly serve customers and team members by aligning similar teams in areas like marketing, finance and operations. We've also been reducing discretionary spending such as travel and facilities. Earlier this week, we announced the formation of a new payments virtual solutions and innovation group that will be led by Avid Modjtabai. This new group will bring teams from across the company together to accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products. This new group includes our innovation, consumer credit card, deposit products, treasury management and virtual channels teams. We continue to be active in providing our customers new products, services and technologies. For example, starting in the third quarter, customers can now send and receive real-time payments with any customer of a bank that participates in clearXchange network and our wholesale customers can now send and receive same day ACH. We\u2019re also making it easier for our customers to open accounts through mobile channels including brokerage, business direct, and personal credit products. Turning to our business segments starting on page 25, community banking earned $3.2 billion in the third quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 2% from the second quarter. The decline from a year ago was due to the lower gains on equity investments. We've already discussed earlier on the call, many of the business trends within community banking, so I'll just briefly highlight that our customers continued to actively use our payment and digital products with debit card transaction volume up 8% from a year ago and credit card purchase dollar volume also up 8%. Mobile active users grew to 18.8 million. Wholesale banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up 6% from a year ago and down 1% from the second quarter. Revenue was $7.1 billion, down 2% from the second quarter due to the gain last quarter on the sale of our health benefits services business. Revenue benefited from record net interest income, up 4% from second quarter and 12% from a year ago. Loan growth was driven by acquisitions and broad-based organic growth with average loans up $48.7 billion or 12% from a year ago, the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. During the third quarter, we closed a portion of our acquisition of GE Capital's commercial distribution finance business. And earlier this month, we completed the final phase of [indiscernible]. Wealth and investment management earned a record $677 million in the third quarter, up 12% from a year ago and up 16% from the second quarter. WIM generated a pretax margin of 27% in the third quarter and had positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked-quarter basis. Positive operating leverage was driven by solid revenue growth, while continuing to invest more in the business. WIM\u2019s average deposits were up 10% from a year ago and average loans increased 12%, the 13th consecutive quarters of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. Client assets across WIM reached record highs this quarter driven both by market gains and continued positive net flows. Turning to page 28, credit results improved from second quarter with only 33 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Net charge-offs declined $119 million or from second quarter from lower oil and gas, credit card and consumer real estate losses, and continued commercial real estate recoveries. Non-performing assets decreased $1.1 billion from second quarter with improvement across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. Non-performing assets were only 1.25% of total loans, the lowest level since the merger with Wachovia in 2008. And for the first time this year, we did not have a reserve build. Slide 29 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstandings declined to $16 billion, down 6% from second quarter, and there were no defensive draws again this quarter. Our total oil and gas loan exposure, which includes unfunded commitments and loans outstanding, was down 2% from the second quarter and down 11% from a year ago. We had $168 million of net charge-offs in the oil and gas portfolio in the third quarter, down $95 million or 36% from the second quarter, driven by improvements in industry conditions. Non-accrual loans were $2.5 billion, down slightly from the second quarter, and criticize loans declined $1.1 billion or 13%. While another decline in commodity prices would have a negative impact on the performance of our oil and gas portfolio, given the current environment, we believe losses peaked in the second quarter. Turning the page 30, our capital levels remained strong with our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in at 10.7% in the third quarter. Our net payout ratio was 61% as we returned $3.2 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Regarding the new Fed proposal for the stress capital buffer, while the initial information provided by the Fed was limited, we have performed our internal analysis and the potential impact appears manageable and the overall changes to CCAR framework are generally aligned with our expectations. I also want to provide an update on where we stand related to TLAC. As I mentioned earlier, we issued $9.2 billion of debt in the quarter that we anticipate will be TLAC eligible. However, this was partially offset by $2.1 billion of long-term debt rolling into the less than one-year maturity bucket. In summary, our results in the third quarter demonstrated strength and momentum in a number of businesses. However, the impact on future performance from the sales practices related events late in the quarter is still unknown. We\u2019re working closely with our customers, our regulators and our team members to move forward and make things right. Timothy Sloan : Thanks, John. Before we end our prepared remarks, I wanted to address a few of the most common questions that we\u2019ve been getting from all of you. The first is whether Wells Fargo's culture is broken. Our goal of building lifelong relationships with our customers and appropriately offering them additional products is still the foundation of our business model. But there was clearly something wrong and we will make the necessary changes to fix it. The values we've always embraced, people as a competitive advantage, doing what is right for our customers, diversity and inclusion, ethics and leadership will continue to guide our company through this challenging period. Second, we\u2019ve received questions about the sales practice activities, who was involved and what the timeline of events was. We have acknowledged that we've made mistakes. However, our board is conducting an independent investigation into our retail banking sales practices and related matters and we\u2019re not in a position to discuss those topics today. Finally, we know there is uncertainty due to the events that have occurred over the last month, including this week. Let me outline what you should expect from us before we have our next earnings call 90 days from now. First, in our retail banking business, we\u2019ll continue our outreach efforts to our customers and focus on making things right. Second, we will continue to work with the board on their investigation as well as all the other inquiries we have received, including meeting the required deliverables under the consent orders. And third, as you\u2019ve heard on the call today, we\u2019re committed to being transparent regarding business trends and you should expect updates on these activities during the quarter. We\u2019re also planning on an off-cycle investor day for next year where we will update you on our business strategies. And finally, I know there is a lot we need to get right. And make no mistake, I get it and our team is on it. Jim Rowe : Before we open up the line for questions, for today, to be as fair as possible, we\u2019re asking that you limit your questions to one question and one follow-up, so we can get to as many questions as possible. Thank you. And with that, Regina, we\u2019re ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Timothy Sloan : Hi, Matt. Operator : Matt, you may be on mute. Matt O'Connor: Sorry, can you hear me? Timothy Sloan : We can hear you now, Matt. Thanks. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Apologies. I thought I saw a blurb out there that you\u2019re hiring 2,000 employees for various compliance controls areas. And I just want to see if that is true. And then related to that, as you think about the expense impact of all of this, any estimates on what that might be? Timothy Sloan : Matt, the blurb really reflected the fact that we\u2019re moving approximately 2,000 of our team members that are in risk and control positions within our business lines to our corporate risk functions. Its\u2019 not necessarily a net increase in the number of team members. Matt O'Connor: Okay. So, I guess, the broader question is, there\u2019s going to be some cost impact of the sales practice issue, probably some revenue impact as well. And do you have any estimates on what that might be. The revenue impact is probably a little bit trickier. But I would think there may be some way to frame some early thoughts on the cost side of things. Timothy Sloan : It\u2019s tough to be specific because we will definitely be adding people in control positions as we build out the go-forward plan and have it agreed to by our regulators. So that\u2019s definitely a cost headwind. And I guess I would calibrate the relevant range in the tens of millions of dollars for that, specifically as it relates to this. And I think you're right on the revenue side. Some of the early trends that we\u2019re seeing just in terms of account openings etc. don't really have a revenue impact. They may ultimately, with respect to how incremental deposits are redeployed or transactional activity in cards, things like that, but they don't have an immediate revenue impact on this quarter, next quarter. The bigger picture, of course, some people have asked is, what will the business model feel like in community banking with a more service oriented culture rather than a more sales oriented culture. And you'll be hearing more about that as it\u2019s fully developed. It\u2019s our intention to to be successful in providing all of our customers with what they need in terms of financial products through a service oriented model. So that'll take some time to develop and to describe for people. And then it will work its way in over the course of the coming quarters, but it\u2019s a question that people have asked and it\u2019s one that we\u2019ll provide a lot of transparency around, so that people can understand the impact of that change as it\u2019s being made. Matt O'Connor: So these costs and then any revenue give-up, do you feel like it\u2019s going to be absorbable in your current earnings power? Or I think the fear out there in the market is not just the headline risk, which will go away at some point, but I think the fear is kind of this $4 plus of earnings power, is that meaningfully at risk when you factor in some of the costs and revenue reduction, and I don\u2019t know if you can comment on that? Thank you. Timothy Sloan : Thank you. It\u2019s tough to say with specificity. We have a very diversified revenue model as you know. There\u2019s so much coming from wholesale. There\u2019s so much coming from WIM. This will be a headwind in community banking. And it\u2019s one that we\u2019ll intend to absorb. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re upping our transparency, so that people can develop their own sense and we can share facts as they\u2019re happening. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Timothy Sloan : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Good morning. Maybe I can ask Matt\u2019s last question another way. You said return goals during investor day of 1.1% to 1.4% ROA. And I guess, really what the question is, is given the uncertainty of the community bank impact on revenue and expenses going forward, are there other levers within Wells Fargo in that you can deliver that 1.1% to 1.4% ROA within the next two years and can you grow earnings without any help from macro next year despite this uncertainty? Timothy Sloan : Erika, it's a very fair question. And let me take the macro orientation of that first. It's always a function of what the economic environment is and what the interest rate environment is. But I think if you\u2019ve seen from our third quarter results that the other businesses that drive this company performed quite well in the quarter. And we\u2019re excited about their growth. But as John indicated, it's a little bit sooner to rate in terms of what the impact, the longer-term impact of the sales practices issues are going to be within community banking. But, boy, I'm very optimistic about the leadership of Mary Mack, very optimistic about our ability to work through those. But it's going to take a while. And as we said, it could get a little bit worse before it gets better. But I\u2019ll tell you, the team in community banking is up to it. John Shrewsberry : I think those \u2013 what we announced at the last investor day in terms of targets are still a reasonable guideposts. I said just a little bit earlier, I think we\u2019ll still be at the higher end on expenses. And, of course, now in addition to what we just talked about with Matt about compliance costs, we\u2019re going to have incremental operating losses as a result of this litigation etc. That\u2019s got to work its way through. And that will definitely be around for a little while. As Tim mentioned, we\u2019re going to have an off-cycle investor day next May. And between now and then, we'll be talking a lot. And if we think that those aren\u2019t reasonable guideposts anymore, we\u2019ll tell people. Erika Najarian : And my second \u2013 my follow-up question, part of your stock\u2019s appeal has always been the dividend and the overall capital return, and I'm wondering if some of the overhang from these issues from litigation, from potential DoJ investigation impact how you think about capital return going forward? Timothy Sloan : Overall, it doesn\u2019t. We\u2019ve provided similar metrics in terms of the range of capital payout, and we are well within those this quarter, and our expectation is to continue to stay in those ranges. John Shrewsberry : We certainly account for a broad range of stressed outcomes in the capital planning process as it relates to operational risk and operational losses. That\u2019s always been true. And it\u2019s true for other filers as well. So it will certainly be our intention to take a similar path going forward with the approach to distribution that we\u2019ve had. Erika Najarian : Okay, thank you. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Hey, could you give us a sense as to why you chose Mary Mack to run the retail bank and give us a sense as to what she's bringing from the wealth management platform, from anything she's done at Wachovia and what your expectations are for how she\u2019s going to deliver? Timothy Sloan : All good questions. First, Mary was the best person for the job. I could not be more excited about what she's been able to accomplish in this environment thus far. She brings experience not only within the brokerage business, but also in the retail banking business. And my expectations are very high and I hope she's listening because they\u2019re high and I'm pretty certain that she's going to be able to exceed the expectations. But she was the best person for the job. Betsy Graseck : But is that \u2013 can you just give us a sense why \u2013 we\u2019re looking for a culture shift or culture enhancement, change in the business model, and that\u2019s a big ask. So I'm just wondering if \u2013 what you saw in her at \u2013 while she was running wealth management? Timothy Sloan : Betsy, I saw an executive with decades of experience in the financial services industry and decades of experience at Wachovia and Wells Fargo, who's been through a variety of challenges in her career and who is an incredibly effective leader and somebody who I believe in, and our entire senior leadership team and the board believe, that who can effectuate the change that is needed on our retail banking platform. Betsy Graseck : And is there opportunities to enhance the efficiency of that platform over time, not in the next several quarters as you work with the outreach with your clients, but over time given the digital investments spend that you've been making and I think given the fact you\u2019ve been running them as separate geographies, so maybe I'm wrong there, maybe very centralized. Timothy Sloan : Well, the short answer is yes. And we talked about that a fair amount at investor day and we talked about it as part of an omni-channel experience. Our customers continue to use our branches as frequently today as they have a month ago, a year ago and so on. But having said, there is incredible opportunities to continue to improve our product set, how we offer convenience to our customers, how our products and our people interact with each other. And, candidly, that's one of the reasons why we announced on Monday the creation of the payments virtual 20 channel and innovation group. And if you want to ask why we picked Avid for that because she was the best person for the job. And that change, I think, I want to just reinforce is very important because what we've done is we've brought together all of the payments businesses, how so many of our customers, both retail and commercial, interact with us every day, we brought them all together. And we think that\u2019s going to create a fair amount of innovation, but also efficiency over time. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thank you. Timothy Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, John. John Pancari : Just want to go to the wholesale impact. I know you commented on the select states, municipalities that have made some decisions to pullback business. Could you just clarify again, which states and municipalities have indicated \u2013 I believe, it was California. We\u2019ve also seen Chicago. And I believe Seattle. And then how we should think about that impact. Can you help us quantify the amount of revenue that you generally generate from that type of business? Timothy Sloan : Sure. John, I'll start. Maybe John will want to jump in. I don't have a list of all the states and municipalities that have either indicated they want to put us on a temporary pause or those that have reaffirmed their business with us. In our investor day materials, we broke out the revenue associated with our government and institutional banking business. One of the benefits that we have at Wells Fargo is that we have these diversified set of businesses, and so frequently in our list of 90 different businesses, not every one of them is necessarily material in any one quarter to the impact of the company. Having said that, our goal is to earn all that business back. Those states and municipalities had chosen to do business with Wells Fargo for a reason. We have great people. We have great products. Are we disappointed that they decided to put us on suspension or pause? We are. But given the environment, it's not surprising. And we respect their decisions. But we\u2019re going to work hard to make things right within the company to earn that business back over time. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thanks. And the separately, back on to the cost side, I know you flagged the legal costs for the quarter and then you also alluded to a more focused marketing effort, I want to see if you have any way to help us quantify those two items at least for the near term. And then separately, the offsets that could come on the expense side to those types of items, I believe you allude to branch consolidation potential later on in your slide deck as well as the travel that you flagged on your comments, so wanted to see how we could think about the timing of that type of relief from those items. John Shrewsberry : Sure. So this is John. There\u2019s a lot of puts and takes there, which is why we usually revert back to the efficiency ratio of target because while we\u2019re definitely going to have elevated compliance related costs and operational loss related costs, we\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives underway, some of which you alluded to. Some are immediate and some are over the forecast horizon of a couple of years. And it\u2019s designed to keep us in or below the high-end of 55% to 59%. So my guidance at this point is that we\u2019re going to be at the high end of that range accounting for all of those things that we\u2019re showing as levers in order to offset the elevated expense. John Pancari : Okay. And no quantification of the legal costs this quarter, correct? John Shrewsberry : It\u2019s difficult to do. It\u2019s very early for the matters that we filed in our 8-K and that you\u2019re reading about in the newspaper. And as those things mature over time, then they\u2019ll begin to have an impact. But they don\u2019t have a dollar impact yet. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks, John. John Shrewsberry : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, John. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Tim, I know it's early here, but maybe you could talk about what factors are you going to be balancing when you redesign the sales incentive scorecard? How are you going to make sure you don't overshoot and cut off legitimate needs-based selling and relationship building while also making sure you don't encourage the wrong behavior? Timothy Sloan : Yeah, it\u2019s a good question, John. I think the focus is going to be, first, on \u2013 and this is a little bit high level, but I'm thinking about what are the drivers of developing those lifelong relationships with our customers. It\u2019s about service. It's about convenience. So think about our bankers being incented to provide good service, and so we\u2019ll be measuring that on an independent basis, to think about our bankers being focused on helping our customers do more business, but being measured on product usage and activity as opposed to individual product sales and also about an overall growth in assets and balances and also think about it being much more driven to a team approach as opposed to just on an individual basis. We think that that is going to be successful. Now, Mary and team are working on the specifics of that right now and when we complete the analysis and they recommend the program, that's one of the other areas that we\u2019ll provide some transparency about. John McDonald : Okay. And then, so a follow-up for John, on the net interest margin and net interest income, when we try to assess the impact of what a potential rate hike would do, one rate hike, it\u2019s hard to discern what happened after the December hike last time because the first quarter, you had a few moving parts. What\u2019s your best guess of kind of what kind of help you get to your NIM from one rate hike? And then what\u2019s the ongoing impact to NIM on the side of \u2013 from TLAC issuance in terms of drag? John Shrewsberry : The net number that I would look to for ease of modeling if we got one 25 basis point move would be something on the order of $150 million per quarter in the first year. There\u2019s a lot going into that in terms of asset liability mix, loan growth, deposit growth, TLAC issuance, etc. But that\u2019s a reasonable placeholder that accounts for the net. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. John Shrewsberry : You\u2019re welcome. Timothy Sloan : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Company. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, Paul. Paul Miller : Hey, good morning, guys. Thank you very much. Hey, relative to some of the shakeup, you guys had an executive leadership. Has there been any thought to bring somebody from the outside? Because a lot of you guys have been with the bank for multiple, multiple years. And to bring somebody from the outside to give a fresh look of the culture. Timothy Sloan : It\u2019s a fair question. It\u2019s one we've been getting. I think the board, by the changes that we\u2019ve made over the last week and a few weeks is comfortable with and very supportive of the management team. I think over the last few years, really since the financial crisis, we had a huge opportunity years ago to reset the entire team and we selected the best folks that were available for all the roles. Since then, one of the great things about the company has been how we\u2019ve been able to attract many senior leaders from outside the company, not only in our business lines, but also in many of our support functions, including corporate risk. So that's already really happened from my perspective. Paul Miller : Hello? Timothy Sloan : Yeah, you there? Go ahead. Paul Miller : I'm sorry. And then, on the independent audit, is there any timeline for that? Did you disclose who is doing the audit? Timothy Sloan : Well, it\u2019s an investigation that\u2019s being spearheaded by Shearman & Sterling, which is working on behalf of the board. It\u2019s independent and we don't have a date by which it\u2019s going to be finished. Hopefully, it will be finished as soon as practical, but I think independence and thoroughness is much more important than getting something done in a short period of time. Paul Miller : Hey, guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Timothy Sloan : Thank you, Paul. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, Mike. Mike Mayo : Hi. Of the 115,000 accounts that were open without authorization and charged to fee, how many customers did those 115,000 accounts reflect? And what\u2019s been your retention rate of those customers? Timothy Sloan : I think the customer count is somewhat lower than the incidence of the product count at least. With respect to the $1.5 million deposit accounts, which is the bigger number, but the ones that couldn\u2019t be rolled out. That\u2019s related to 1.1 million customers. So it was a 3 :2 ratio there. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s somewhat south of a 100,000 customers for the 115,000 impacted accounts. And the retention ratio \u2013 I don\u2019t have the retention ratio at hand. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s independently being measured, at least not at this level. Mike Mayo : I guess, a follow-up, this is a long wind-up here, but it\u2019s a little frustrating not getting that retention [indiscernible] the customers that were impacted the most, what\u2019s been your retention rate. I guess we can\u2019t really ask about the internal investigation. There\u2019s no timeframe. We can\u2019t ask who knew what and when. We can\u2019t ask why it took so long to stop the problem. This is the first time we\u2019ve had to ask a question on the call. We don\u2019t have Steve Sanger on this call. And so, it\u2019s a long wind-up like I said. A little bit more on potential branch closings. Slide, I guess, 24, you talk about, it could allow you to review the branch footprint for consolidation opportunities. 6000 branches. You\u2019re having success with digital delivery and it\u2019s exciting that Avid is promoted into this new position. I'm sure you\u2019ll look at that. Can you give us something concrete as relates to all this? Maybe when you look at the new chapter, what the potential might be for efficiency improvements, especially if you\u2019re telling us efficiency should be elevated for some time? Timothy Sloan : Mike, listen, I appreciate your question. And as one of the many stakeholders at Wells Fargo, I'm sorry that we've disappointed you. But we just spent 30 minutes talking about what\u2019s going on at the company and we provided a lot of information. We provided new slides that provide a tremendous amount of detail on some of the retail sales practices issue and we deliberately and diligently walked through the performance of all of our businesses. And you know what, if that doesn\u2019t satisfy you, I am sorry. Mike Mayo : All right. Well, maybe at the next year\u2019s investor day, do you think we\u2019ll hear more about how you\u2019ll configure your branches and kind of the next stage of that? Timothy Sloan : Sure, absolutely. We talked about that at our last investor day. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we want to accelerate the timing of our investor day because we want to provide increased transparency which we\u2019ve done today and we want to provide a more continuous updates as to how we are operating the company. Mike Mayo : All right. Well, I look forward to the incremental updates that you give. Thanks. Timothy Sloan : Likewise. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies and Company. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot. I was wondering if we could just talk about the environment a little bit. Loan growth was okay, but, certainly, we've seen this kind of air pocket on the commercial side a little bit from the industry perspective. And I'm wondering if you could just talk about what you guys are seeing in terms of commercial demand, especially? And if you\u2019re seeing any just noted changes in terms of customer activity and whether you think that's either fleeting or whether you guys are a taking a different view of the extension or credit at all? Timothy Sloan : I think, overall, in the wholesale businesses, as you said, every quarter can be a little bit different in terms of loan growth. We didn't see any trends in any of our wholesale businesses that would cause us concern that commercial real estate loans are going one way or asset-based loans are going another. One of the reasons why our loan growth in the third quarter was in commercial wasn't as strong as in prior quarter is because our energy book declined by \u2013 I can't recall exact figure \u2013 $1.5 billion to $2 billion. We\u2019re still very active in the energy industry. But it makes sense that there is a bit of a decline there. We had a few kind of larger underwritings that either paid off or were transformed into long-term debt or equity for our customers, but nothing alarming from our perspective. Ken Usdin : All right. And then to follow-up, John, I noticed that the securities book was $390 billion at the end of the quarter. It looks like you're moving some of that liquidity and maybe also replacement of some of that loan growth. Can you just talk about the reinvestment philosophy? What kind of stuff you're investing in? And are you able to find a good ROA, ROE on moving the book into securities at this time, given where rates are? John Shrewsberry : Sure. Well, the first call on that liquidity would be loans that we just talked about to the extent that there was incremental loan demand. We\u2019ve \u2013 versus how we\u2019ve deployed liquidity in the past, we, obviously, have more of a bias toward things that qualify for HQLA just because of the environment that we\u2019re living in for liquidity. So you\u2019ve seen a lot of agency mortgage-backed securities. You\u2019ve seen some treasuries. We\u2019ve actually got a program of late to be a little bit more active in the Ginnie Mae securities because of their liquidity properties. We also have a portfolio of \u2013 a smaller portfolio on the security side are somewhat more credit sensitive, so high-grade corporates or CMBS, things like that we replenish every quarter as well. The returns are okay and we have this lower for longer bias that makes us comfortable deploying capital in that way and liquidity in that way and the capital to withstand what happens if we\u2019re wrong about rates and we end up in a higher rate environment. But it\u2019s consistent with the approach that we\u2019ve taken over the last couple of quarters. We paused in the first quarter while there was a real, real drop in \u2013 it was market volatility that gave rise to risk-free rates going as well as they have. But now in the second quarter and the third quarter, we\u2019ve been back to converting cash into duration basically. Ken Usdin : Thanks, John. John Shrewsberry : That helpful? Ken Usdin : Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Brian Foran : Good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about overdraft charges. A few articles out there have kind of maybe asserted some of the opt-in processes were over-zealous, let's call it, at the retail network, so is that something you've looked at as part of your review? And then, we don't get a ton of history from the reg filings, but it is broken out now. It seems like your overdraft was running about 12%, plus 12% year-over-year in terms of growth which is a good bit stronger than the industry, so even separate from any of the sales practice stuff, maybe just what was driving that kind of overdraft fee growth? Timothy Sloan : Sure, Brian. We saw some of the same reports that you did. And, candidly, those were a little bit of a surprise. Having said that, like all facets of our retail banking business, we\u2019re going to review those. And to the extent there any issues, we will deal with them. But we\u2019re not aware today that they were a driver of overdraft income. Brian Foran : Great. And then maybe on some of these new account production metrics, it's very helpful. I appreciate the disclosure. I'm assuming the average life of checking accounts and credit cards is pretty long, so is there like a rule of thumb translation you can give us? If the run rate of new accounts is down 25% for six months, let's say, is that a 1 percentage point headwind to balance growth, 2 percentage points? How should we think about that in terms of thinking about balance growth, all else equal over the next two years? Timothy Sloan : Yeah. I would separate that into credit cards, one, and deposit accounts, second. I think credit cards it's a little bit tricky just because over the last few years we\u2019ve seen such gross in our credit card business in terms of penetration and our usage numbers have been good. But you could imagine a point where there \u2013 if credit card growth is down a little bit that in a year or so from now that we could see some decline. But, of course, that assumes that we don't make any other changes in our credit card products, in our offerings, how we interact with customers and the like. So don\u2019t have a great rule of thumb there. And, again, as it relates to the deposit accounts \u2013 and, John, jump in here if you feel differently \u2013 we\u2019re so new into the impact. And what we tried to do in the expanded disclosure is show you the decline in a monthly basis, but also give you a sense of what the impact was on the total base. I think that's how I would think about it. And I appreciate that you appreciated our increased disclosure. Brian Foran : Thank you. John Shrewsberry : And I guess the only thing I would add is that not all deposit accounts are equal in terms of the contribution to deposit balances. I think we have deposits growing by $6 billion when we have new accounts not opening as quickly. Timothy Sloan : Brian, that\u2019s another reason why we want to continue to provide enhanced disclosure because we want to make sure that you are comfortable with how any of the headwinds we\u2019re facing right now are affecting business. Brian Foran : Thank you, both. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I guess my question gets back to, sadly, to the account issue. But can you describe if there's been any review of interactions and communications about these kinds of issues with the board? And just to sort of get to my follow-up, what I'm really wondering is, if this raises the risk of qualitative review, as it relates to CCAR or any other kind of regulatory action? Timothy Sloan : So let me take the first part of that question. As I mentioned, the board has engaged Shearman & Sterling to do an investigation of retail sales product issues and other matters. And we want to be very respectful of their process. And we want that process to be taken seriously and to be viewed independently. So I don't want to comment on the specifics of how they\u2019re going to go about their review. But we look forward to\u2026 Eric Wasserstrom : Sorry to interrupt, but I guess I'm getting to the issue of \u2013 it seemed like at least from the press reports, this issue went on for several years before management made the board aware and I'm just wondering if that issue has been addressed. Timothy Sloan : Well, here's how I would answer that and that is there\u2019s going to be an independent review and I think that it would be appropriate to wait for the independent review as opposed to jumping to conclusion about what media might think. I don't mean to be disrespectful to the media, but I don't know if they have all the facts and the review will look at all the facts and will make some recommendations, I'm sure. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks. Timothy Sloan : Hi, Marty. Marty Mosby : Hey. You created a new role on the board, a Vice Chair, and you put Elizabeth Duke in that role and appointed her there. She has an extensive amount of industry and regulatory experience. You created that role for a purpose. Can you frame that a little bit for us and let us understand better what you \u2013 how you expect to leverage her in that role? Timothy Sloan : Sure. Marty, I want to be very respectful of the fact that neither John nor I created that role, the board did. First, we have a terrific board. It\u2019s diverse in terms of the types of industries that they\u2019ve been involved in, their experience, and we just couldn't be more pleased with the quality of that board, in particular, having both Steve Sanger and Betsy being \u2013 Betsy Duke being willing to step up into these roles is I think absolutely the right decision that the board should be making in the circumstance. Separating the CEO and Chairman role is something that we've done in the past. But, again, in particular to Betsy, to have somebody like that with not only industry experience, but also regulatory experience in this environment to provide assistance for Steve is exactly what\u2019s needed. Marty Mosby : And then not to Monday morning quarterback or rehash what you've done in the past, but, Tim, I really wanted to ask you, what, in this experience, has changed the way you think about the role of CEO, as you now assume it, and Wells Fargo as a company or a culture? And what is the key takeaway? Whenever you go through these extreme crises, there's always something that you've learned that will make the company better as you move forward. What have you learned that you're going to now take to the \u2013 your new role and be able to push forward? Timothy Sloan : Marty, that\u2019s a great question. And by the way, don\u2019t apologize for being a Monday morning quarterback. Candidly, we deserve that and we\u2019re used to it over the last ferw weeks. I also want to preface my remarks by saying, I\u2019ve been in this role for less than 48 hours. And I want you to have high expectations for me, but actually I want to make sure that those are a bit tempered. When I think about the retail sales practices issues we\u2019ve had at the company, I wish that the business had escalated the issues sooner. I wish when the business escalated the issue that while the senior management team did a lot in response, I wish we could have done more. And I highlight that because I think that one of the lessons that I've learned \u2013 one of the lessons the entire company has learned and one of the reasons that we\u2019re organized the way we are today and we\u2019re making many of the changes that we\u2019ve talked about are that we've got to escalate issues wherever they occur within the company sooner. We\u2019ve got to deal with them sooner and we\u2019ve got to make sure that to the extent that they have any impact on our customers that we deal with that impact as quickly as we can. So it\u2019s about escalation and it's about speed and dealing with challenges and also dealing with opportunities as they come, Marty. Marty Mosby : Do you feel that in that vein, being a high performer and being looked at as a high-quality bank for so long created some blinders, that maybe those blinders have now been taken off in your \u2013 like you're saying, reacting and moving quicker at this point? Timothy Sloan : Yeah, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a fair question. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ve created blinders. But, again, the fact of the matter is we should have escalated these issues sooner and we should have dealt with them more quickly than we did. So to the extent that some of our prior success impacted that, so be it. I can assure you that we\u2019ve talked about what you just described a lot. And we\u2019re going to make sure that that doesn't create a blinder now or in the future. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Good morning. I never thought I'd ask you about this page of your press release again, but I'm looking at page 31 at the accretable yield, which usually wiggles and wobbles by $100 million or $200 million a quarter, and all of a sudden the expected cash flows are down by almost $5 billion. So can you say what happened there and does that \u2013 is that a headwind to net interest income going forward? Timothy Sloan : I'm glad you asked. I wasn\u2019t sure whether anybody was going to get there. But the \u2013 so the accretable balance was down $4 billion in the quarter. It stands at about \u2013 I think \u2013 about $11.2 billion right now. So what\u2019s happened here is that prepayments have sped up. We\u2019ve reached a point where a lot of these borrowers have gotten themselves in the money for refis because of the path of HPI and we\u2019re experiencing and modeling faster cash flows as a result of that. And so, frankly, in the near term, I think we\u2019ll see an increased interest income as more of that comes through. But what it means is those loans won\u2019t be outstanding for as long as we might have previously predicted because they will be refi-ed. Chris Kotowski : So that would be elevated accretion into net interest income than the next four \u2013 couple quarters, whatever, as you experience that? Timothy Sloan : Correct. Chris Kotowski : Okay. And then, headwind in future quarters after that. Okay. And the other thing I was wondering is how should we think about the impact of the settlement on op risk RWAs? Obviously, the financial impact is minor, but the impact on your company has been big in terms of management and press and reputation and so on. So how quickly does it all get factored in and any light you can shed on whatever the algorithm is? Timothy Sloan : Yeah. So it\u2019s tough to say because the chapter \u2013 the middle chapters haven\u2019t been written of what the op risk outcome is. We know what the settlement was, but we\u2019ve got a variety of legal matters that we have to attend to, all of which will factor into a future view of what the total op risk experience is from it. So at the margin, it would be increasing. I think I mentioned earlier, in CCAR, our own stress analysis, we concoct and imagine outsized op risk outcomes to demonstrate that we\u2019ve got the capital and earnings power to overcome them and the magnitude of what we\u2019re talking about here frankly, \u2013 while it\u2019s significant, is modest in comparison to what you can imagine in stress, both in our own scenario as well as in CCAR. And, of course, what it means from the regulators perspective is they think about our op risk capacity in the future is up to them. But it will have an increase with the margin. It doesn't have a material increase in the moment because the numbers, as you say, have not been that big on the scale of Wells Fargo's balance sheet and earnings power so far. But it\u2019s a headwind and op risk. We\u2019ve been fortunate to have had modest op risk outcomes relative to the GSIB peer group over the CCAR era and this feels different because of the severity of the reputational harm that\u2019s been created. Chris Kotowski : Okay. Alrighty. Thank you Chris Kotowski : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Hey Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thank you. Hi. Quick question just on \u2013 easy one first, on the long term debt, I know you said it went up based on the TLAC issuance, but didn't you also have debt that you put on related to the GE deals for pre-funding those deals that was puttable? Is that still on the balance sheet or did you put that back this quarter as well? John Shrewsberry : Yeah, it\u2019s still on the balance sheet. So it is puttable and it's FHLB asset financing. So it shows up as longer-term debt. And you can see that on page 15, I think, of today's deck. So still in place. Now, of course, we\u2019re just using it as part of the general liability structure overall and will use it as long as we think that it is a good component of the stat. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. And then on the slide where you're monitoring the customer activity in the retail banking, you note that consumer checking account opens were down 25% year-on-year, credit card applications down 20% year-on-year. But if you start to annualize those numbers, they start to get very large, if you think about the credit card applications. That would be down on a full-year basis down 12% year-on-year relative to the total outstanding. So is there a way to quantify what that monthly impact was as it relates to revenue? I'm sure like not all applications actually get opened, but\u2026? John Shrewsberry : The waterfall there is that applications may or may not become approvals and approvals may or may not become activated cards and activated cards have to become utilized and utilized cards become balances and balances accrue interest. So there\u2019s a lot of steps that have to be gone through before applications have an impact on either assets or revenue. One of the reasons for showing this is to help people understand what the immediate impact is and then to roll it forwards, so we can see whether annualizing that September number is really the right way to approach. September, obviously, was the first month. It\u2019s the month where we pulled back on marketing. It\u2019s the month when our team members were probably the most uncertain in terms of what the go forward model is going to be as we pivot toward service. It\u2019s the month when our customers and prospects are first reflecting their real dissatisfaction with Wells Fargo, all those things put together. And those are going to change in different ways as we roll it forward. So it\u2019s the installed base that drives the P&L results and that is where it is. And Tim mentioned that we\u2019re going to roll this forward probably during the quarter, so people can see whether October looks like September and November looks like October and then we can start to build a projectable impact on the trend. Hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. Brian Kleinhanzl : It is. Thanks. Timothy Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Vivek, how are you this morning? Vivek Juneja : Good. Good, Tim. Congratulations even though we would have all hoped it would have been under better circumstances. Timothy Sloan : Me too. Vivek Juneja : A question for both of you. You took a charge in the second quarter for CFPB several months which was announced September 8. Why no disclosure in the financial filings and are you planning to change anything as you think about that aspect as you look forward? John Shrewsberry : So it\u2019s tricky one because we certainly account for these items when they become known or probable and estimable under GAAP. But, separately, we\u2019re also \u2013 these are also part of a confidential supervisory information that \u2013 there\u2019s a limitation of how much you can talk about while you\u2019re in the middle of a negotiation with the regulator. They can talk about whatever they choose to and they do sometimes and other times they wait until it ends. So we think about the circumstances in the moment. We, obviously, would love to be just close with and help people understand what's going on. We\u2019re certainly taking the charges when we need to take the charge. But we\u2019re not alone in that discussion. And usually, the circumstances are governed by \u2013 in the case of a regulator, the regulator. So that\u2019s how I think about that. Vivek Juneja : So not even without giving us the amount, you couldn't even disclose a set of facts or the existence of those discussions? Timothy Sloan : Vivek, the way that I would think about it is that this stems from the lawsuit that the City of LA filed a year before that. And so, there were issues that we were dealing with. But as John said, we\u2019ve got to be very careful and respectful of what we disclose in terms of conversations that we have with our regulators and that's really important, and the so short answer is we followed appropriate policies, procedures, rules and disclosure requirements. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Separate question, sort of linked to all of this regulatory scrutiny that's going on, Tim. As a G-SIFI bank, scrutiny, obviously, with all of these happening, is going to increase for you. Does that have any bearing on how you think about the asset size as one metric? You're almost $1.95 trillion, the third largest bank. Citi reported a gap, gets companies to widen [indiscernible] growing even faster. Is that something that factors into how big is too big or what does it mean longer term? Timothy Sloan : Yeah. It\u2019s a fair question. I think \u2013 we\u2019re focused less on size because size is ultimately determined by our customers. It\u2019s not necessarily determined by us. We want to arm our team members with the right incentives and have them work together and provide a good advice and service to our customers and make sure that we\u2019ve got great products out there. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive our size. Having said that, we need to make sure that as we think about our returns, so putting the [indiscernible] you might use, which we do all the time. Are we getting and providing the appropriate returns for our investors based upon our size? That's how we think about it. Having said that, we\u2019ve looked at across the company and you\u2019ve seen us exit some businesses that we believed would not provide us with as strong return as they might provide another owner. We sold our crop business. We sold our HSA business and so on. And because we appreciate in this environment and given the amount of liquidity and capital that we have that we\u2019ve got to be very mindful in terms of for how we deploy our assets. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning, gentlemen. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, Nancy. Nancy Bush : Couple of questions, Tim. The first one, much has been made of the investigation that the board is independently conducting, the Shearman & Sterling investigation. I have not heard everything that's been said about that, whether the results of that will be made publicly known when it's over. Timothy Sloan : A good question. I do not know the answer to that. The board will decide that. Nancy Bush : Okay. So there's no sort of regulatory imperative along with that? I'm assuming the regulators will have a look at that, but I'm just wondering if there's a transparency issue here that sort of needs to be overcome. Timothy Sloan : Well, I wouldn\u2019t jump to a conclusion about whether it\u2019s a transparency issue or not. As you can see, we\u2019re trying to be more transparent in terms of the operations of the company than we\u2019ve ever been. But, Nancy, I want to be very respectful to the Board because that\u2019s the Board\u2019s decision. Nancy Bush : Okay. My second question would be this. Obviously, there are going to some near term issues here, not only retaining customers, but in attracting new ones. And I'm wondering if there is any thought being given to deposit pricing or fees, et cetera, as one of the levers to attract these clients? Timothy Sloan : Nancy, all good ideas in this company are on the table. And we\u2019ve got an impressive management team whenever a company and it\u2019s the certainly case for us faced with these kinds of challenges. It\u2019s absolutely appropriate to step back and think about all aspects of how we provide product and service and convenience to our customers. And we certainly are thinking about price. Having said that, when you think about the driver of our company, one of the drivers for our company for decades is building that lifelong relationship that's not based on price. So could we make some changes in our pricing of certain products, deposit or otherwise? Sure, we could. But I would not expect us to lead with price. Nancy Bush : Okay. If I could just ask as an add-on to that. Obviously, your employees have really been put through the wringer through this whole process. Is there any thought about additional compensation or bonuses this year or something just as a way of saying, we're sorry? Timothy Sloan : I think that saying that we put our team members through the wringer is an understatement. I really do. I really do. Especially team members on our retail banking platform. But it's throughout the company. We want to make sure that we retain the best people that we can. And we think we offer a very competitive set of compensation and benefits. We talked a little bit about that on one of the slides. But we appreciate that we\u2019ve got to recruit our team in this kind of environment and all ideas are on the table. Nancy Bush : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Kevin Barker : Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on\u2026 Timothy Sloan : Hi, Kevin. Kevin Barker : Hey, how are you doing? Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow-up in regards to your comments around the expenses and the efficiency ratio and you're saying it's going to be elevated. And you said it's going to be elevated or on the higher end of the 55% to 59% range into 2016. Are you now saying that that range is no longer valid and longer term \u2013 going into 2017, you might be above the efficiency ratio range or how should we think about that? Timothy Sloan : You should think about it as an annual range. This quarter, we popped up above it, but still a good annual range. And if we start thinking that it\u2019s not, then we\u2019ll telegraph that to people. It\u2019s hard to be more specific. The operational or compliance-related issues are one set of cost that maybe can be modeled in the near term. But to the extent that we\u2019ve got lumpy operational losses that drive it up, those are just harder to predict and they\u2019ll happen when they happen. But if we think we\u2019re \u2013 the band is no longer the right band, then we\u2019ll tell you that. Kevin Barker : Okay. And then when we think about the spend on marketing and compliance, are you expecting that to be offset by the potential to have branch closures or reductions in your branch costs in order to keep the expenses under control due to other areas or how should we think about the puts and takes around the expense number? Timothy Sloan : Yeah. I wouldn't tie the two together. And I certainly wouldn't be focused on branch closures. What we\u2019ve talked about, and again I reflect back and how we described our branch platform at investor day, that we continue to update it all the time. We move branches around. We open new branches. We combine branches. We may close a few. I think this year, in fact, there\u2019s going to be a reduction unrelated to what we\u2019ve talked about here. But as John described, we\u2019ve got to look at our expenses and we have been looking at our expenses for some period of time to be able to keep the efficiency ratio within the range, even though it's at the upper end of the range because we need to invest not only in compliance, we\u2019ve got to invest in technology and bringing on new products and cyber defense and all of the above. John Shrewsberry : Another thing, Kevin, is \u2013 as it relates \u2013 because other people have asked today with regard to that whatever might happen on the branch network side of things. That doesn't necessarily give you an immediate lift if you\u2019re thinking about today's elevated compliance cost or today\u2019s elevated marketing costs. If we\u2019re making moves on the physical distribution side of our business, that creates benefits in year two, year three, year four, but it\u2019s not really an immediate offset. So as Tim said, I wouldn\u2019t think about those as offsetting levers. Kevin Barker : Okay. Do you think you can stay within your target if rates were to remain flat from where they are right now? John Shrewsberry : Well, the way that range was constructed was with our expectation for rates, which is practically flat. But, for example, if we get a 25 basis point move in December, that wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable and that\u2019s essentially baked into being in that range. If we stay flat, we\u2019re not that far off of that. It\u2019s not that big. If we had a big move up in rates, which I think is highly unlikely, then that would probably move us down in the range. I think we\u2019ve said that before. Kevin Barker : Yeah. Thank you very much. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Good morning. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Sneaking in under the wire here. Just wanted to follow-up with \u2013 on Marty's question. Tim, the response seemed largely tactical. And so, I guess, as far as thinking about changes that your leadership might mean, does that mean that your view on the strategic approach versus prior leadership is largely unchanged? And it's certainly true you haven't been in the seat very long, but the idea that you would be taking over is certainly something that wasn't out of the blue. So I'm sure you had some ideas coming in here? Timothy Sloan : Well, I have lots of ideas, but candidly I'd be a lot more nervous if I were you if I came out with some new strategic plan for Wells Fargo in 48 hours. That would be pretty dangerous from my perspective. But, look, the company \u2013 when I think about the company that I joined 29 years ago, it\u2019s so different today. My guess is Wells Fargo is going to be different five years from now, 10 years from now and 15 years now. And you know what, I hope it is, because by changing and adapting to the environment we are in, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we've had a history of success, notwithstanding the last month or so. The last month or so has been a real challenge as we\u2019ve talked about on the call today and I am sure we\u2019ll continue to talk about for a while. But we've made some important announcements this week. Again, you might call them tactical. I think they're actually in the strategic bend. The creation of a new business line, the elevation of some new senior leaders in our wholesale banking and our community banking business as well as consumer lending. They\u2019re going to bring some new ideas. So, no, fair point that it\u2019s probably a little bit more tactical and strategic, but over time you'll see some updates and we'll talk about those over the next few months and I'm sure we'll talk about some of that at Investor day next year. Brennan Hawken : Sure. And actually, the spirit of my question was actually in response to Marty's question. I think you had talked about making adjustments to the escalation methods on the back, right? So that was more the reference of tactical rather than the management changes that you\u2019ve made. Okay. Sorry, Time, go ahead. Timothy Sloan : No, no. I appreciate it. Fair question. So a different direction here, for the second question. One of your wire house competitors did come out and confirm the recent stories on their policies for dealing with the DOL rule. Have you finalized your policies and can you tell us any details about those? John Shrewsberry : So we\u2019re \u2013 this is John. John Shrewsberry : We\u2019re still in the process of refining the overall implementation approach to be compliant with the rules. I think we\u2019re still going to approach every client relationship with an emphasis on every client having a customized plan that guides their investment activity. We\u2019re going to emphasize advisory solutions and continue to offer traditional brokerage for certain clients that include self-directed options. And we\u2019ll be sharing more details as we get closer to implementation. I think with each ensuing quarter between now and later in 17, you should expect to hear a little bit more about the specifics of the implementation. But we haven't reached the same conclusion in the same timeframe as the comparator that I think you're referring to. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for the call. Timothy Sloan : Thank you. I know it's been a busy morning for everybody and our call has been a little bit longer than normal. But I really want to thank all of you for your thoughtful questions, the discussion I think has been incredibly helpful for both John and me and we look forward to continuing to provide additional disclosure to you as we move through the quarter. And we thank you for your interest in Wells Fargo. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. And you may disconnect.",

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo fourth quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin your conference. Jim Rowe : Thank you, Regina. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our President and CEO, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our Web site at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tim Sloan. Tim Sloan : Thank you Jim. Good morning and Happy New Year. Thank you all for joining us today, I know it\u2019s been a very busy morning for most of you. Our results in 2016 demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model with loan and deposit balances at an all-time high while we maintained a strong risk discipline. Last few months of the year certainly were challenging, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the hard work and progress of our team -- that our team made to rebuild trust which I'll highlight shortly. But first I want to summarize our financial performance for the past year. We generated earning of $21.9 billion and EPS of $3.99 a share. We grew revenue by 3% including 5% growth in net interest income. Average loans grew $64.5 billion, up 7% and average deposits increased $56.5 billion, up 5%. Wealth and investment management total client assets reached a record high of $1.7 trillion, up 7%. Our credit results continued to be strong with net charge off rate of 37 basis points. We returned $12.5 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases and we reduced our common shares outstanding by 76 million shares. On Page 3 we describe the progress we\u2019ve made on our retail banking sales practices remediation plan, including contacting our retail and small business customers and encouraging anyone who has concerns to contact us. We established a sales practice consent order program office reporting directly to our Chief Risk Officer which is undertaking actions to meet the requirements of the consent orders that were issued as part of the settlements in September. As part of this effort we submitted a Reimbursement and Redress Plan to the OCC and the CFPB in December. We refunded a total of $3.2 million to customers including the 2.6 million that was part of our original analysis. As part of the consent orders work is now under way to expand the time periods of our review to cover the beginning of 2011 and the period through September 2016 and we've hired an independent consultant to evaluate sales practices. We've also gone beyond the requirements of the sales prices consent orders as part of our effort to make things right for our customers including a nationwide mediation program at no cost to our customers. In addition we've begun the data analysis to review 2009 and 2010 for potentially unauthorized accounts and we've engaged a separate third party consultant to evaluate sales practices more broadly across Wells Fargo. We are leaving no stone unturned so that we can emerge from this a better stronger company. We've also made progress on evaluating potentially unauthorized credit card accounts including any impact to customers' credit scores and analysis of credit signatures to verify authorization. We want to identify anyone who was negatively impacted so we can make things right. We've accomplished a lot over the past few months but we still have a lot of work to do and we understand that it'll take continued effort and time to rebuild trust with our customers, team members and other key stakeholders. Another important action we've taken is the recent launch of our new retail banking compensation program, this has been a top priority over the past few months and it is a significant step in reinforcing to our retail banking team members what is expected of them, how their actions connect to our business priority of serving our customers and how they'll be rewarded for performance against these expectations. There are five key principles to the new plan which we highlighted on Page 4. First, there are no product sales goals which we previously ended in October. Second, we will gauge success based on customer service, increases in primary customers, household relationship growth and risk management, and not on opening new accounts. Third, this new plan includes a strong focus on team performance with metrics heavily weighted toward team and branch goals, not just individual goals. Fourth, we have stronger controls in place to monitor behavior and ensure we're doing things the right way, including more proactive monitoring at the regional and corporate levels. And finally, we will be closely monitoring results for any unintended outcomes or behaviors prompted by the new plan and we will make changes as needed. It will take time to communicate the plan and train 1,000s of team members so they understand the changes they need to make to successfully achieve new objectives. We're also leveraging a number of new business success metrics including primary customer growth, which measures the growth of customers that use Wells Fargo as their primary financial institution, and household relationship balanced growth to measure how Wells Fargo satisfy the broad financial needs of our customers. We will share more details on these and other metrics during our Investor Day in May. The incentive plan rollout is an important step in restoring trust, this new program coupled with our work in redefining our service experience and training our leaders and frontline team members will be important elements as we continue this work. Also effective this week is part of our annual compensation review process, we increased our minimum hourly pay rate to a range of $13.50 to $17 an hour, a 12% increase from the previously minimum rate and 86% higher than national minimum wage. We believe this increase is a right thing to do for our team members. On Slide 5, we provide the December customer activity in retail banking which we\u2019ve been updating on a monthly basis since our last earnings call. In general, while account openings are still down from a year ago, customers continue to actively use their accounts and many of the trends have shown improvements from the lows earlier in the fourth quarter. Let me highlight a few of those trends in more detail. Customers are increasingly coming into our branches including a modest increase in banker interactions which started in the last two weeks of November and continued through year-end. Customers continue to open more checking accounts than they closed and primary consumer checking customers increased 3%. Our credit card business benefitted from strong holiday spending and December had record monthly purchase volume growing 8% from December of 2015 and active accounts were up 7%. While new application stabilized in October, we have not seen an increase in application volume. The decline in December compared with November reflected normal seasonality. We have recently started to reintroduce some outbound calling and direct mail and we will be monitoring these results very closely. Customer experience scores continue to improve from the lows experienced early in October, with branch customer experience scores nearing pre-settlement levels by the end of December. While customer loyalty scores have steadily improved since the lows in October, we still have work to do in order to return to previous highs. The improvement in these scores reflects the outstanding jobs that our retail banking team has done by focusing on providing exceptional customer experience. Our existing customers have continued to use their accounts and we\u2019ve seen higher deposit and credit card balances and increased credit and debit card transaction volume which drives near-term revenue. The decline in the rate of new account openings may impact the pace of future revenue growth, so we\u2019ll continue to be transparent regarding those trends. In addition, we\u2019re also tracking the impact to our other businesses, while businesses that are not reliant on retail banker referrals have not been significantly impacted, lower banker referrals continue to affect businesses such as mortgage. Referrals accounted for approximately 9% of mortgage originations in 2016 and we expect lower referrals in the fourth quarter will reduce funding volumes in the first quarter by approximately 2.5%. In summary, we are pleased that the trends have stabilized and many metrics have started to show improvements. Before turning the call over to John Shrewsberry to discuss the details of our financial results, I want to update you on our resolution plan. We\u2019re working closely with this Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC to better understand their concerns, so that we can bring our resolution planning process in line with their expectations. Additionally, to demonstrate our commitment to the remediation of the deficiencies and the overall resolution planning process, we have implemented actions to limit the size of our total non-bank subsidiaries assets to the levels in place as of September 30th, 2016. We\u2019ve already reduced assets to below this level as of year-end and expect to operate at this level for the foreseeable future. We are committed to remediating the two deficiencies identified by the agencies in our revised submission that is due in March and have added significant resources to this effort. John Shrewsberry will now discuss the details of our financial results. John? John Shrewsberry : Thanks Tim and good morning everyone. We earned $5.3 billion in the fourth quarter, the 17th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. Our consistent performance demonstrates the benefit of our diversified business model that has continued to perform well through the challenges we\u2019ve faced in recent months. We had solid underlying performance in the quarter including a record level of loans and deposits and strong growth in net interest income. It's important to note that our results in the quarter included the loss of $592 million or $0.07 a share from the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness accounting. Slide 8 provides more details on our long-term debt hedging program. As we\u2019ve previously discussed as part of our overall asset/liability management program, we typically swap our fixed rate long term debt to floating rate in order to balance our deposit oriented liability structure and better align with the interest rate sensitivity characteristics of our assets. We also issue non-U.S. dollar long term debt to diversify our funding sources and a portion of that debt is swapped to U.S. dollars. While we believe this hedging strategy is prudent from an asset/liability management perspective it\u2019s generally not possible to achieve a perfect accounting hedge due to the differences in the required valuation measurement of the hedging instrument and the hedged item. As a result this can produce hedge ineffectiveness gains and losses from quarter-to-quarter as interest and exchange rates change. However, the hedge ineffectiveness recognized over the life of the hedging relationships is expected to be zero as long as the hedge accounting is maintained and the hedges are held to maturity. In 2016, we experienced significant quarterly volatility and hedge ineffectiveness due to key interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations, including a hedge ineffectiveness gain, net of related economic hedges of $379 million in the first quarter and a net loss of $592 million in the fourth quarter. However the 2016 full year net hedge ineffectiveness accounting impact on our results was a loss of only $15 million. FASB has issued an exposure draft on hedge accounting guidelines and new guidance is expected to be issued in 2017. If issued in its current form, the interest rate related ineffectiveness associated with our long term debt hedges would be significantly reduced. Turning to Page 9, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. We had strong loan growth up $6.3 billion from third quarter on commercial loan growth. Consumer loans were reduced by the $3.8 billion deconsolidation of certain previously sold reverse mortgage loans following the sale of the related servicing in the fourth quarter. Investment securities increased $17.1 billion with $44 billion of purchases, predominantly agency MBS. The growth in this portfolio as well as a smaller balance sheet drove the $32.3 billion decline in short term investments and Fed funds sold. Deposit growth was also strong up $30.2 billion from third quarter with increases in commercial, consumer and small business banking balances and our short term borrowings declined $27.9 billion reflecting lower repurchase balances. Credit quality remains solid and we had a reserve release for the first time in 2016 which was $100 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to the income statement overview on Page 10, while revenue declined from the third quarter we had strong growth in net interest income up $450 million and our NIM increased 5 basis points. Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion driven by net hedging ineffectiveness, accounting losses, as well as lower trading and mortgage banking results which I will discuss later. Other sources of non-interest income were diversified and relatively stable. There are a lot of linked quarter changes and specific expense categories this quarter which I will highlight later in the call, but in total expenses were down $53 million from the third quarter. As shown on Page 11 loans increased $6.3 billion from third quarter with broad based growth across many of our commercial and consumer portfolios. Our auto portfolio was an exception as balances declined $587 million from third quarter. To respond to conditions in the competitive landscape and to maintain our risk tolerances we've tightened our underwriting standards. Auto originations in the fourth quarter were $6.4 billion down 21% from the third quarter and down 15% from a year ago. We currently expect balances in our auto portfolio to continue to decline in the near term. On Page 12 we show year-over-year loan growth. I'm not going to highlight each portfolio but our commercial growth was strong across many businesses and asset classes and the $3.8 billion deconsolidation of reverse mortgage loans reduced the growth rate of our 1-4 family first mortgage loan portfolio. As highlighted on Page 13, we had a record $1.3 trillion of average deposits in the fourth quarter, up $67.4 billion or 6% from a year ago with growth in both commercial and consumer deposits. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased 8% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost increased four basis points from a year ago driven by commercial deposit pricing. There was little to no market response to the rate hike in December 2015 and we currently believe that deposits betas from the rate hike in December 2016 will also be low, at least initially. Indications so far support this view, but we continue to monitor the market to ensure we remain competitive for our customers while maintaining our disciplined relationship based pricing strategy. Net interest income was up $450 million or 4% from the third quarter reflecting growth in loans and investment securities, higher interest incomes on trading assets and higher income from variable sources, including periodic dividends and fees. There was also a modest benefit from higher interest rates in the quarter. Net interest margin increased five basis points from the third quarter driven by growth in earning assets including deployment of cash into investments and the net benefit from higher interest rates. Income from variable sources benefited the NIM by approximately two basis points. Our growth in earning assets in the higher rate environment continue to benefit net interest income as we remain asset sensitive. However first quarter will reflect the impact from two fewer days and the typical linked quarter reduction in income from variable sources. Non-interest income declined $1.2 billion from the third quarter including the $592 million of net hedge ineffectiveness accounting losses as well as lower trading and mortgage banking fees. I've already explained the impact from net hedge ineffectiveness, so let me highlight the drivers of our mortgage banking and trading results. Mortgage banking results decreased $250 million from third quarter and included a $163 million decline in mortgage servicing income primarily due to higher unreimbursed servicing costs. These costs increased $109 million in the fourth quarter as a result of actions we took to work through an aged population of FHA foreclosed properties, where we\u2019ve had challenges in repairing and conveying them back to HUD. As a result we increased our estimated cost to resolve these properties in the fourth quarter, however we expect these actions will reduce unreimbursed servicing costs significantly in 2017. Residential mortgage origination volume was $72 billion, up $25 billion or 53% from a year ago and up $2 billion from the third quarter. Applications were down 25% from the third quarter and we ended the fourth quarter with a $30 billion unclosed pipeline similar to our pipeline a year ago. Our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the fourth quarter, down 13 basis points from the third quarter primarily due to a higher mix of correspondent originations in the fourth quarter. We currently expect origination volume in the first quarter to be roughly in line with the volume we had in the first quarter of 2016 but down from fourth quarter due to seasonality in the purchases market and lower refi volume driven by higher interest rates. On Page 16 we provide some details on trading related revenue and the impact in net interest income and non-interest income. Total trading related revenue was down $378 million from the third quarter, trading related net interest income was up a $146 million in the fourth quarter reflecting higher average trading asset balances as well as $98 million from periodic dividends and carry income on certain hedged trading positions in our equity and RMBS books. The corresponding decline in the value of these hedges was reflected as a loss in net trading activity, so they\u2019re revenue neutral. Net trading activities declined due to a $223 million decrease in secondary trading, reflecting lower client volumes compared with the strong third quarter as well as seasonality, fewer trading days in the fourth quarter and lower client demand as clients adapted to the rising rate environment. While our client focused business model typically underperforms the market in periods of high volatility, we believe we successfully managed through the post-election market volatility in the fourth quarter. A $106 million of the decline in net trading activities was from deferred compensation trading results which was largely offset in employee benefits expense. Finally, there was a $61 million decline from a change in credit valuation adjustments in the fourth quarter due to market driven changes in credit spreads and higher swap rates. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 total trading related revenue was down $27 million. On Page 17 we highlight the five quarter trend across major fee categories, compared with a year ago many of our fee businesses grew including deposit accounts, brokerage, investment banking, card and mortgage originations. This page illustrates that while many businesses had above average results in the fourth quarter, total non-interest income reflected below average mortgage servicing income and lower market sensitive revenue which was down $526 million from a year ago. As shown on Page 18 expenses declined $53 million from the third quarter, but our efficiency ratio increased to 61.2% primarily driven by the impact of net hedge ineffectiveness losses on our revenue. Our efficiency ratio for the full year was 59.3%. We expect our efficiency ratio to remain at an elevated level. While total expenses were relatively flat from the third quarter there were some meaningful changes in some specific expense items in the fourth quarter. Personal expenses were down a $195 million from the third quarter primarily due to lower revenue related incentive compensation, lower deferred compensation expense and one fewer payroll day. As a reminder we will have seasonally higher personal expenses in the first quarter reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense. We have typically higher outside professional services, equipment and advertising expenses in the fourth quarter, and combined these categories increased $394 million from the third quarter. This increase was also driven by higher project spending and legal expense. Operating losses declined $334 million from third quarter on lower litigation accruals. And all other expenses declined $116 million from third quarter which included a $107 million donation to the Wells Fargo foundation. As we highlight on Page 19, we remain focused on expense management and efficiency. We\u2019ve been working on a number of initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018 with the full year benefits starting in 2019. This is not a new focus, we\u2019re just providing you with more detail in our initiative this quarter to reduce expenses. We\u2019ve summarized these opportunities into three categories and included the stage of completion on the right of this page. The largest opportunity relates to centralization and optimization. We\u2019ve started to make changes in how we\u2019re organized to reduce complexity and redundancy by continuing to realign staff areas including marketing, finance and technology. These changes should not only reduce cost, but should also enable us to more seamlessly serve customers and team members. We remain focused on reducing discretionary spending in areas like facilities, non-customer related travel and third party spending. And as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we\u2019re also focused on selective divestitures of non-core sub-scale businesses which includes the sale of our crop insurance and health benefit services businesses last year. We also formed the payments, virtual solutions and innovation group which will accelerate our focus on delivering the next generation of payments capabilities, advancing digital and online offerings and investing in new customer experiences and products. While these efforts should have a meaningful impact to certain expense categories, there will not be a bottom line impact as these savings will be reinvested in the business. Our expense focus enables us to operate more efficiently, generate meaningful expense savings and continue to invest to drive future growth, all while continuing to have a strong efficiency ratio. Let me take some time to discuss our branch strategy in more detail, it\u2019s along with each and every business within the company as part of our focus on discretionary spending. We continuously evaluate our branch network and while our physical distribution strategy is driven by customer behavior. While branches continue to be a critical component in serving our customers\u2019 needs, our investment in digital capabilities has enabled us to seamlessly serve our customers across channels providing them with more choice and convenience in how they bank with us. And as a result, more transactions are occurring outside the branch. Our strategy is also influenced by geographical differences in our individual markets, economic trends and competitor actions to close or open branches. Once external trends indicate that there is an opportunity for branch closures, we focused on the customer impact. Additionally, we evaluate the CRA impact and the branch profitability and other key criteria to maximize expense savings and minimize revenue loss. Based on observed trends in customer behavior, we began to accelerate branch closures in 2016 and closed 84 branches mostly in the second half of the year. We expect the pace of branch closures to increase to 200 branches in 2017 and we expect closures at that level or slightly higher in 2018. There also continues to be opportunities for de novos in some attractive markets. Many of the closures this year will be in closed proximity to another branch and therefore we don\u2019t expect a significant revenue or team member impact. The full year expense benefit usually occurs one to two years after the branch is closed. We will be providing more details on our branch distribution strategy at our May Investor Day. Turning to our business segments starting on Page 21, community banking earned $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter down 14% from a year ago and down 15% from third quarter. The declines were primarily due to net hedge ineffectiveness losses and lower mortgage banking results. We\u2019ve already discussed many of the business trends within community banking, so I won't go into any more details here. Wholesale banking earned $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago and up 7% from the third quarter. Revenue was $7.2 billion, up 9% from a year ago driven by 16% growth in net interest income. Balance sheet growth was strong with both deposits and loans at record levels. Loan growth was broad based with average loans up $44.5 billion or 11% from a year ago, the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. And we have completed the final phase of the GE Capital's portfolio acquisitions in October. Wealth and investment management earned $653 million in the fourth quarter, up 10% from a year ago and down 4% from the third quarter which was a record quarter. Fourth quarter results reflected strong balance sheet growth with net interest income up 14% from a year ago. Average deposits were up 10% and average loans increased 11% from a year ago, the 14th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. WIM total client assets reached a record high in the fourth quarter of $1.7 trillion, up 7% from a year ago driven by higher market valuations and continued positive net flows. Turning to Page 24, net charge-offs increased $100 million from the third quarter with 37 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Commercial losses were up $36 million driven by $32 million in lower recoveries. Consumer loses increased $64 million driven by higher losses in credit card, auto and other revolving credit and installment loans due to seasonality, higher severity in auto losses and a movement toward more normalized losses in unsecured lending. Residential real estate portfolios continue to improve with net charge-offs down $28 million or 41% from the third quarter. Our first mortgage loan portfolio had net recoveries in the fourth quarter and we had only 38 basis points of loss in our Junior lien portfolio. Non-performing assets continued to decline down $644 million from the third quarter with improvements across our consumer and commercial portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. We had a reserve released of $100 million reflecting continued improvement in our residential real estate portfolio and stabilization in our oil and gas portfolio performance. Slide 25 provides details on our oil and gas portfolio. Outstanding continued to decline down 8% from the third quarter and down 15% from a year ago. We had $177 million of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter with all losses from the E&P and services sectors. Given the current environment we continue to believe that losses peaked in the second quarter of 2016. Non-accrual loans were $2.4 billion, down $84 million from the third quarter and criticized loans declined $776 million or 11%. Turning to Page 26, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in was stable at 10.7%, well above our internal target of 10% which includes the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer. We repurchased 24.9 million common shares in the fourth quarter and entered into a $750 million forward repurchase transaction which settled this week for 14.7 million shares. We returned $3 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. The final TLAC accrual was issued in December and becomes effective on January 1, 2019. We estimate that as of December 31, 2016 we will need to increase our portfolio of qualifying TLAC by approximately $18 billion in order to be compliant. This shortfall is lower than our previous estimates which were based on the proposed rule due primarily to the grandfathering of existing debt governed under foreign law in the final rule. It also was impacted by lower RWA levels at year end. However the removal of the phase-in period in the final rule will result in a modest acceleration of our issuance plan. We issued a total of $32 billion of qualifying TLAC in 2016 and we currently expect issuance in 2017 will be at a similar level to fund both maturities and our targeted build of qualifying debt. In summary our results in the fourth quarter demonstrated solid underlying performance as we continued to meet our customers' financial needs. We had record levels of loans, deposits and client assets. Our credit quality, liquidity and capital all remained strong. We once again earned more than $5 billion in the quarter demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model which continued to perform well during a period where we faced unique challenges. It's been only four months since we signed the sales practices consent orders but we've already made progress in restoring customers and team members trust and we remain committed to being transparent with investors while there is still more work to do we're confident that we will build a better Wells Fargo that will continue to meet our customers' financial needs. Benefit the communities we serve and provide opportunities for our team members and investors. And we can now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein, please go ahead. John McDonald : I wanted to ask about the rate sensitivity profile, John. I was wondering if there's been any change in the core rate sensitivity and could you remind us what kind of benefit do you get from the Fed hike that we got in December? John Shrewsberry : Sure. So we're still in the -- I think we're in the 5% to 15% range, which is what we talked about the last time our Treasurer, Neal Blinde presented more broadly, that hasn't really changed very much. I think we've estimated that the quarterly impact -- a full quarterly impact of a 25 basis point parallel shift, which is different than what we got in December, although arguably we got more than that in the long end, is worth in the order of a $150 million per quarter and that estimation still holds as well. John McDonald : I know you put some swaps on in maybe 2015 it was, which muted what would have been your maybe natural asset sensitivity. Just wondering as to maybe you're thinking about the rate environment evolves, are you able to get out of that and adapt that or is that locked in for a few years? John Shrewsberry : Those hedges will be in place for a few years. They\u2019re captured in this calculation of our rate sensitivity and so if you think about LIBOR based commercial loans as the hedged item there those won\u2019t float up and that incremental benefit won't be passed along in the near term as a result of the choice to fix those out and to earn higher interest income in previous periods and to change their profile. So that's not where the benefit would come from, it\u2019s other floating rate loans, it's incremental floating rate loans in those categories that haven't been hedged. But those -- that program was a result of a specific decision to reduce interest rate sensitivity in a period that felt lower for longer and there will be other assets that float up that create a benefit on the [Multiple Speakers]. John McDonald : I guess your sensitivity also will come from your liquidity deployment. It looks like you put some to work this quarter with the Fed fund sold down $30 billion. I know you get asked this all the time but is there a way for us to think about how much of that $270 billion or so of liquidity is deployable and flexible dry powder versus needed to meet the various liquidity and other requirements? John Shrewsberry : I think we're sticking with 10s of billions at any point in time as incrementally deployable. This relationship between the liquidity value of whatever we might be incrementally investing in and there are limitations as you know on certain -- the definitions of certain assets is either high quality liquid assets or not. And then there is the capital impact of moving too far out the curve and increasing our exposure to diminution and OCI in a rising rate environment. So there are a lot of tradeoffs to be made. We're making them all the time with that -- with the same outcome in mind that you're curious about. We will be deploying more in a higher rate entry point, but subject to those constraints and what it means for capital and what it means for liquidity versus holding cash. Operator : You're next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Tim and John, I think people are really appreciative of the incremental, just putting a number around the work you're already doing on the cost side. You did however mention that you expect to reinvest it. So, I was wondering if you could help us understand your comments just about the efficiency ratio remaining high. Does that mean high relative to your historical 55%, 59% range or does it mean high end? And just how would you help us understand just how you get from point A to point B and how we start to see efficiency improvement over time? Tim Sloan : So, John I\u2019ll start and then you jump in. I think Ken the efficiency ratio metrics that we set out at our Investor Day last year are really guidelines for us to operate in in the environment that we expected to turn the clock back to last May. We think that 55% to 59% range is best-in-class in the industry and the range that we're expecting to operate in for the next couple of years. Things have changed clearly, and expectations have changed, but the efficiency ratio is a function of not only your expense rate, but also revenue growth and we're hopeful that we'll continue to grow revenue overtime as we did over the last year in 2016. And our guidance is that, in the short term as revenue continues to grow and we continue to have some headwinds from an expense standpoint and the first quarter is going to be a good example of that because we'll have some impact from annual incentive compensation impact and so on, that we\u2019ll going to be at the high end, and again we think about this expense ratio -- our efficiency ratio, excuse me, not on our quarterly basis, but as much year-over-year. So, our expectations for 2017 is that we\u2019ll probably be at the high end of that range. John Shrewsberry : And the only thing I'd add is that, and this is implied, but to the extent that we're getting revenue increases from interest income then that's substantially more efficient in terms of dollars of expense per dollar of revenue then most sources of non-interest income. So, there should be a lift if we\u2019re getting it in interest income. Ken Usdin : That's great, John. And that's actually my follow-up, as well, is that you do seem to have a decent path towards NII growth from the factors that you've talked about, and to John's questions before. Can you talk about just some of the moving parts inside fees in terms of how those businesses feel? The brokerage business has flattened out, but maybe hopefully it's turned the corner. And then obviously there is the mortgage side of things, which obviously with rates, the unclosed pipeline is down a little bit. So, what drives fee growth as you look ahead? Where do you see the most opportunities? And what are the things that we have to just be mindful of? John Shrewsberry : Sure. The big sources, setting mortgage aside because we talked about it a little bit in the prepared comments and I think you just nailed it, we\u2019re in that lower point in the refi cycle. So it\u2019s really about getting after the purchase needs of our customers and then those refi that do come up, but applications are down across the industry and I think people expect that in general. So what that yields will depend on the path of where rates go, how jobs are formed and what the demand is for home buying. In our other big sources, deposit, deposit service charges, our customers are using our products more than ever, so we\u2019ve had good growth in debit card and we\u2019ll continue to work there and now we need to continue to attract new customers to the bank in order for that to grow like it has in the past, that is an area of focus for Mary as she launches her new program in community banking and of course a lot of that also comes from the commercial side of things where we\u2019re a leader in providing treasury management services to our corporate customers as well. So -- and that\u2019s been a growing business for us over the last several years. On the card side, new credit card applications are down, but for the cards that we have out there and the cards that we are originating now, people are using them more, they\u2019re transacting more, they\u2019re spending more, their balances are higher, et cetera. So those have driven good sources. And then with respect to brokerage, obviously we\u2019re at high market levels right now so we expect good fees from that as well as institutional asset management, but with David Carroll\u2019s teams focus on meeting the saving for retirement and investing needs of all of our banking customers, my sense is that there continues to be an opportunity there also. We have to execute along all of those dimensions, but there is a real path forward. Tim Sloan : Yeah, I would just reinforce the opportunity we have in wealth and investment management, as John said David and team did a terrific job last year and when you think about growing that business 10% year-over-year and just couldn\u2019t be more pleased with those performance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to get some clarification on the response to Ken's question. As we think about the reduction of expenses and investing it back by year-end 2018, does that mean that the expense base on an absolute basis could potentially be flattish in 2018? Or is that too simplistic to think about because we really have to think about the revenue side, as well? I'm just trying to think about whether or not we should think about the $2 billion as something that can self-fund investments in 2018 or we really should be going back to the 55% to 59% efficiency ratio guidance. John Shrewsberry : I would say with the latter. Tim Sloan : I would too. John Shrewsberry : Because you never know where a dollar of revenue is going to come from and especially on the non-interest income side, the mix matters in terms of what it\u2019s related expenses are and so I wouldn\u2019t be predicting a couple of years forward what that mix is going to look like or what the associated expense impact is going to look like at the margins from a dollar of one sort of non-interest income versus another, I would think about it as these are undertakings that we have going on to accomplish all of our incremental spending and still stay in 55% to 59% on an annual basis. Erika Najarian : And just to clarify, it sounds like if we do get a structurally higher curve, like you said in previous calls, that could really drive the path to the middle or lower end of that 55% to 59% efficiency ratio target. Tim Sloan : Overtime, over time, but again Erika I mean it\u2019s a function of so many other different variables. I mean not just interest rates, but just fundamental economic growth. If the economy grows at 3% is better than 2% and that means its loan was going to be higher and maybe other activity will be higher. I would just reinforce John\u2019s comment, just to think about that 55% to 59% that we\u2019re going to save a lot of money here at Wells Fargo, and we\u2019re going to reinvest that business for the long-term that will pay benefits well beyond the next couple of years. John Shrewsberry : I do think it\u2019s reasonable though to say to get to the lower end of the range it\u2019s going to be because of the impact of higher rates on interest income. Erika Najarian : Okay. And just if I could squeeze one last question in here, in the back of the retail sales issue there has been a lot of focus on new account openings. And I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of whether or not the profitability of your primary customer has really been impacted by the scandal. Because as I've been talking to investors about this, does new account opening really matter if that credit card was not being used anyway or was sitting in a drawer? I guess I\u2019m wondering if we could -- I know you've given a lot of detail already, but I'm wondering if the new account openings statistics sort of overstates what the revenue impact to your primary customer is from the retail sales scandal. Tim Sloan : Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. And I think the short answer is it\u2019s too new to tell. The value of a relationship tends to increase overtime, and generally relationships are a little bit less profitable at the beginning than they might be two years from now and four years from now and five years from now. So, I don\u2019t mean not to ask [indiscernible] question Erika, so we\u2019ll have to reduce your question next quarter. But the fact of the matter is that I think it\u2019s just too early to tell. We\u2019re just excited that we saw what seems to be an inflection point in the midst of the fourth quarter. And so we\u2019re starting to see some real positive attributes in some of those metrics, not only in terms of accounts activity, but also in terms of customer service and experience. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: I wanted to follow up on a comment earlier. I think you said -- I just want to make sure I didn't hear it incorrectly, but have you promised to keep the absolute size of your balance sheet at the 9-30 [ph] level? Is that the entire balance sheet or was that just segments? Did I miss something there? Tim Sloan : No. What we said is that, we\u2019ll keep our non-bank subsidiary balance sheet at the 9-30 level. And that accounts for probably 10% of our overall balance sheet. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. All right. So from my point of view not that big of a deal. Just separately, you guys have talked about that there's a third-party review of all layers of management into the sales practicing and what was known and what wasn't known. There's an article, I think, this past weekend just talking about emails being reviewed. I can appreciate that takes a very long time for a firm your size, but any thoughts on when that would be concluded and when and how it would be communicated to investors and analysts? Tim Sloan : Well, think of the review in terms of sales practices in two parts. One is a requirement under the consent orders with the OCC and the CFPB to have a third party consultant come in and take a look at sales practices, primarily in our retail related business and so that's just begun. My guess is that will take the good part of this year to accomplish and then separately because you know as I said in my earlier remarks we want to leave no stone unturned here, we've said that -- and we have brought in a separate consultant to look at sales practice across other businesses within the company. And my guess it will take much of this year to complete that work and if we find something that's important, we'll communicate that, but if nothing happens we may not communicate it. But we\u2019ll take it as it comes, but I think given our desire to be very transparent we'll probably err on the side of over communicating as opposed to under communicating that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI, please go ahead. John Pancari : Back to the sales practice issue, given that you're seeing some turn, some inflection here that you cited in some of these metrics and everything, are you in any better position to help quantify what you would say would be the all-in recurring financial impact of the issue, both with the foregone revenue as well as the related expense impact from this? Tim Sloan : No, I would say not. But John jump in if you feel differently. Just because we're -- this has been going on for at least the last quarter or so and while we're pleased with what we think is hopefully an inflection point. We may have months over the next few months where things turn the other way again for a month. But what we're really focused on is the long term trend. In the short term the revenue impact has not been significant, but we want to be careful about that, is that to the extent that we're growing primary checking accounts at 3% instead of 5%, over time that would have a bigger impact. So I would still put it in the category of too new to rate. John Shrewsberry : One specific I can add is that I'd estimated for the next several quarters we\u2019re probably a $40 million to $50 million this quarter of outside professional service fees which includes the third party [Multiple Speakers] incremental, which includes the reviewing third parties and law firms as well and that probably grows a little bit and then tails off. So that's incremental. John Pancari : All right, thank you. And then, separately, I know you were alluding to this a little bit earlier with the asset sensitivity questions, but I just wanted to see if I can get some thoughts on your NIM trajectory here in coming quarters, just given the TLAC pace now is going to be a little bit quicker and that's a negative drag. But also you've got the impact of the rate hike. So, how would you be thinking about the trajectory of the margin here through \u201917? John Shrewsberry : So I'd rather talk about it in dollars if those are useful to you, because NIM is really an outcome and we can't predict what exactly is going to happen with deposit flows, et cetera. But just to put a dollar sign on it, if we don't get any more moves by the Fed in 2017, and I anticipate that we might, but if we didn't given that their pace of TLAC issuance that you mentioned, given the balance sheet positioning today, given what we might expect from loan growth, what we could imagine from redeployment et cetera, we're -- it's pretty easy to sketch out a 4%, 5%, 6% net interest income growth trajectory, full year '17 over full year '16. What that means for a NIM because of what the balances are, that are applied to that, is a little harder to pin down. Operator : You're next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead. Paul Miller : You talked about in the beginning of the call that you've gone all the way back to 2011. But I know there's been some discussion in the media and some politicians of going back farther than that. Are the regulators good with you going as back to 2011? Or do you need to go back farther later on? Tim Sloan : Paul good question and let me clarify, under the consent orders we're required to go back a little bit earlier in 2011 than we have previously done and then bring forward the analysis to September of 2016 to the date more or less that we've signed the consent orders, that's the regulatory requirement. We've decided, right -- this is the management of the company not any third parties located anywhere else around the country, have decided that we think it's appropriate to go back and look at 2009 and 2010, that's something that we announced in late September, October and so we're in the midst of doing that but think about that as a separate effort outside of the consent order requirements to make things right for our customers. Paul Miller : Okay. So, the 2011 is a consent order, you're willing to go back as far as 2009. And have you had discussions with people in Congress who were asking you guys to go back even further than that? Does that satisfy their needs? Tim Sloan : Well I'll leave satisfaction rates in Congress to them. We think that it's important to go back and look at 2009 and '10, we've picked that timeframe because that's when we Wells Fargo and Wachovia together, and we think that's right from our perspective. It's well beyond the requirements that our regulators set for us. So, we're in the midst to doing that. Paul Miller : And then my follow-up question, I did ask this of Jamie Dimon, but I was wondering what your thoughts of it, on the mortgage world the credit box is really, really continuing to be tight. And you heard a lot of the new administration guys talking about opening up the credit box. Can they open up the credit box effectively? And what do you guys want to hear for you guys to start drawing down and opening up the credit box in the mortgage world? Tim Sloan : Well it\u2019s a good question. We think it's very important to continue and to provide a broad suite of mortgage options to our customers and we think we do that better than anybody in the industry, we've got the number one share and we're satisfying customers every day. There is no question that there have been certain rules and regulations that have been promulgated over the last eight years which have impacted and provided some concern in the industry not just with big banks in terms of how we provide credit, some of it is related to the fact that we all, we\u2019re part of servicing settlements that went back decades almost and which were a surprise to everybody. So I think the more that there can be clarification, and FHA is a great example, the more that there can be clarification on any uncertainty in the future, the better. Having said that, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made in terms and performance of our first mortgage product which is focused on first time homebuyers. That the volumes has exceeded our expectations and so we\u2019re just really pleased with the fact that we\u2019ve had a very strong origination year and you know the credit quality within the mortgage businesses has just continued to exceed our expectations. As John noted in his remarks we had net recoveries in the fourth quarter from our first mortgage business. So we\u2019re really pleased with the position that we have in the mortgage business we\u2019re hopeful that the new administration can continue to provide clarification in terms of that business and we look forward to working with them. John Shrewsberry : Two things I would add, we\u2019re not looking for a way to put lower credit quality first mortgages on our balance sheet. So if there are others who are looking for loosening the box for that outcome, I don\u2019t think that that would apply here. And as it relates broadly to tightening the credit box as a result of financial crisis, it\u2019s really about underwriting the ability to repay and that\u2019s what constraining how much money people can borrow or whether they can borrow and it\u2019s a reasonable requirement, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re operating. So, customers have to be able to provide evidence of their ability to repay, so more jobs, et cetera. It advances that cause versus making it -- lowering the requirement for the ability to repay. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Couple of questions, one your guidance for the efficiency ratio remaining to the high end of the range, near term. What assumptions do you have baked in for rate hikes and when you\u2019re defining rate, I am presuming near-term, I\u2019m presuming you\u2019re thinking 2017? John Shrewsberry : In our own internal analysis there is one in the middle of the year and one at the end of the year. So, not much in terms of the short end of the curve providing incremental interest income is in that calculation. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Right, and so then this full notion of the 2 billion savings that you\u2019re talking about, that\u2019s going to come over the course of the \u201917 and \u201918, and then the investments also coming during the same time frame, is there any timing differences in those and that\u2019s all supposed to be at the same time? [Multiple Speakers]. John Shrewsberry : It's self-funded at the same time. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So completely different question. Living well, what went wrong with that and the changes that you have to make, what kind of implications will that have for you in terms of your numbers. Tim Sloan : So, fair question. The focus of the regulators on our -- the submission -- the resubmission that we made last fall related to legal entities and shared services and so what we\u2019re in the midst of doing is having as I mentioned some very good quality meetings with the regulators to make sure that we appreciate with their expectations are. And focused on providing more detail to them in terms of how we manage risk related to all of our legal entities. And then how we -- our shared services would operate in the midst of a catastrophe at Wells Fargo, actually we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to occur. And so we\u2019ve redoubled our efforts there, we\u2019ve added some additional folks and additional resources, and we\u2019re going to work very hard and improve the quality of our submission which is due at the end of March. I don't fundamentally believe that it's going to affect our ability to serve our customers and rebuild trust in any way, shape or form. But we were disappointed and we\u2019ve got to make some improvements and we\u2019ll do it. Vivek Juneja : And will that legal entity change, would that make any changes to your fund, your liquidity, any of that, any comment, any color on that at this point? Tim Sloan : Well at the margin it might impact some things, but not materially to that. John Shrewsberry : There might be some prepositioning of capital liquidity into various entities, but from your perspective it wouldn\u2019t have a meaningful difference. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : I had a couple of well more micro and small issues and then I had a big question for you Tim at the end. We're looking at the servicing. Usually the servicing fees would kick in when rates started to go up. However, you had that unreimbursable cost. Your servicing fees dropped down to 18 basis points was about the lower I\u2019ve seen. That is temporary and should rebound back to a more normal 20-ish type of base points going forward, I think I heard you say that. John Shrewsberry : So, servicing fees that are coming off of the unpaid principle balance of our servicing portfolio will track how big the servicing portfolio is. And it has shrunk overtime as prepayments have been faster, frankly faster than our share of the origination market, as we\u2019ve existed different types of businesses to de-risk both our mortgage origination as well as mortgage servicing business like the reverse mortgage portfolio we sold this quarter for $4 billion of unpaid principle balance like several of these origination program that we deem higher risk overtime.  So the notional that is driving the contractual servicing fee stream has been coming down and as you\u2019d expect we think it will stabilize now, because we\u2019re -- prepayment should sort of halt or a creep in a higher rate environment. But as you say in a higher environment, we\u2019d also expect that the flow towards more as we as escrows and taxes and insurance and other things, those are worth more to us in a higher rate environment than in a lower rate environment, and that should start to work its way in overtime.  And then specifically on unreimbursed foreclosure costs, on the one hand we\u2019re working down the long-term cyclical amount of foreclosed properties, et cetera, that need to be worked out of the system. We\u2019re originating those types of loans, FHA loans in particular at a much slower pace than we were previously. And now we\u2019ve taken this step, where we\u2019ve taken charges in Q4 that we think are really going to reduce the rate of that expense in 2017. So, I would expect servicing revenue in general to be meaningfully positively impacted by that last piece in particular. Marty Mosby : And then when you look at the hedge ineffectiveness where you had the -- related to your long-term debt, I would assume that the credit spread comparison, in other words, the real basis risk changed, was your credit spread gapped out with the reputational issues that you're working through right now in the marketplace, and that drove a large part of this negative. So that would be an unusual in this particular quarter. Would that be correct? John Shrewsberry : I don't think that's as big a driver as you think. It's really, it's a portion of it because you're discounting that leg of the hedged relationship with A, credit spread in it, and B, the swap leg you're not. But it has more to do with the direction of rates and the amount of the uptick in the swap rate over a short period of time than our spreads. You can see the impact of our spreads in Q3 versus Q4 in our net CVA outcomes on the trading side of things because we generated positive P&L in the third quarter from our own spreads gapping out and then we didn\u2019t have that in the fourth quarter, but that\u2019s a -- those are relatively small numbers for Wells Fargo. Marty Mosby : Okay. And then Tim, the big question is, Mary Mack's gone around now and you said talked to 3,000 team members. Is the environment such that had she would have done that a year ago or two years ago, nobody would really want to step up and say anything bad about the Company because everybody was thinking of it as such a hot performing institution. Is the flow of information freeing up so you're getting some really good information and ways to improve along a lot of different lines with these town hall meetings? Tim Sloan : Oh absolutely Marty, and that's part of the -- you know when we think about rebuilding trust at the company, rebuilding trust is not only with external stakeholders, but candidly it's primarily -- the primary focus was 268,000 team members. If we don\u2019t rebuild trust with all of them then we\u2019ve got bigger issues and I think Mary's outreach in terms of her town halls and she's been tireless in terms of these town halls is very important and many of the other senior leaders within the company have had similar town halls and have been out there more than we've ever been, talking to our team members and the way that we're getting feedback from our team is not just through those town halls, but also through requests that we make to them through surveys and we're getting all kinds of great ideas in terms of how to improve Wells Fargo and many of them that we're implementing. So I'm really pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of our internal communication and we're seeing that in terms of some of the feedback that we're getting from our team members and that translates into better service for our customers and personally I think that's one of the drivers. I mentioned that in my earlier remarks in terms of the improvement in the customer experience scores in retail. I couldn't be more pleased with that performance given the circumstances. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC, please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Tim, I think you touched on that you raised the wages of your lower wage workers well above the Federal Minimum Wage. Can you share with us what that will do for operating -- compensation expenses in 2017? I know seasonally first quarter everybody has the uptick in employment expenses, but what will that do for expenses this year? Tim Sloan : So, a fair question and I'll give you an answer that's probably a little bit frustrating, so I apologize in advance, and that is that, we don't really look at it that way. Because one of the reasons why we wanted to increase the minimum levels of compensation is that we want some other positive outcomes. So outcomes like lower turnover and that could be a -- have a net impact and would have a net impact and we think it will have a net impact on whatever the expense number might be. Lower turnover means lower training cost, it means a higher productivity because you've got more experienced bankers, tellers, service folks, that are working with our customers, so net-net overtime making this decision we think is a net positive for the company so we really don't look at it as gosh it's going to have this kind of an impact in a certain period of time, because the other outcomes that I mentioned aren't really known until we look back a year from now. Gerard Cassidy : Fair enough. And then the follow-up question is, can you guys give us some color on how the GECC acquisition is performing, how the integration has gone? Have you been very pleased with it? Just some color there. Tim Sloan : Any acquisition and integration is complicated. And so my answer will not do justice to the incredible amount of hard work and effort to all of the 100s of people if not 1,000s of people within the company that have been working hard on that integration. But overall I would tell you it has exceeded our expectations. The quality of team members that we were able to bring on from GE has just been very impressive, their engagement in the business and how happy they are to be part of Wells Fargo is very encouraging. The quality of the customer base that we were able to bring on has exceeded our expectation and those customers are doing more business with us and one of the opportunities that we have overtime is to broaden those relationships because GECC which was a terrific lender, was just that, a lender, and we have other products and services that we can provide to their customer base, so if this is the nine-inning game, the first inning we put some points on the board and score some runs and hopefully we'll continue to do that, but again long answer to your question, so far so good. Operator : You're next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : I wanted to discuss the branch rationalization strategy a little bit, what the thought process is there, especially the thought process around the 200 branches. You have a slide where you have some bullets around some of the factors that you consider when you close a branch. But when I look at that number, it's about 3% of your branch network, the 200 figure. You've closed fewer branches than perhaps some of your peers have in recent years. But I guess the bigger question is, whether you can do a little bit more there and whether you can pull the cost lever harder through a bit more aggressive branch rationalization. Just wanted to go through the branch strategy and how you think about that and what some of the factors are in determining that 200 figure per year. Tim Sloan : I'll start and John jump in, it's a great question. What you saw last year is us increasing the pace of branch rationalization, so that 80 plus that we closed last year, most of that was in the second half and what that\u2019s reflecting is us listening to our customers in terms of how they want to do business with us they still want to come in to branches, but they also are accessing us via online and mobile, and through ATMs, and on the phone. So our strategy is really based upon listening to customers and looking at their habits and how they want to interact with us and based upon that we think it makes sense and Mary\u2019s has had an opportunity to oversee the business for the last six months and what we\u2019ve concluded is that we should increase the pace of rationalization to about 200 this year. I wouldn\u2019t describe that as our long-term branch strategy, because again it\u2019s really a function of reactions and habits from our customers. We may increase, we may decrease, who knows, it\u2019s going to be based upon how they want to do business with us. But what we\u2019re seeing right now is, it leads us to the conclusion to be focused on that 200 branch number for the year. John Shrewsberry : I think that\u2019s right and we\u2019ll continue to -- they\u2019ll be a feedback loop from this process to see how customers react to it, whether we\u2019re right or wrong about the customer attrition, deposit attrition or other things that we\u2019re trying to minimize by taking the strategy that we\u2019re taking and if six months into this, we think there is an opportunity to do more, then we\u2019ll come back and we\u2019ll do that. And we\u2019ll talk in some more detail at our May Investor Day about the process that we used to analyze this, why we think this is the right approach to take, some of the idiosyncrasies of our branch footprint versus the others that you\u2019re familiar with just in terms of owned, leased, that cost to operate, et cetera. We\u2019ve got branches, there is a lot of them as you might know in very low cost locations and so the expense pick up that you might be imagining may not be exactly the same as if they were all in coastal communities or major metropolitan areas, et cetera. There is a lot of differences from one to the other. But this is the beginning of a process where we\u2019re picking up and the whole time customers will be reflecting in their use of physical versus virtual, how much they value coming into our branches and we can keep feeding that back. Saul Martinez : Great, that's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on an earlier question, what proportion of your employees are affected by the minimum wage hike? Do you have that figure? John Shrewsberry : It\u2019s about 26,000 people. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Just two questions, please. One is, you mentioned the tightening of some of your underwriting standards and portions of the auto portfolio. Could you just maybe give us a little insight into what you were doing and where, whether it's in the credit spectrum or new versus used or how that's playing out? John Shrewsberry : So, we\u2019ve been holding fast on term. I think we\u2019ve talked about this with this group before, but there is between leasing as a competitive product or just other lenders willingness to go to seven years and beyond more frequently than we are. That has cost us to lose some volumes, sticking by that. And the other two areas I think are proof of income, on the one hand, which is part of how we try to underwrite credit and then back to ability to repay. You mentioned new versus used, because we\u2019re not attached to a manufacturer and we don\u2019t have a leasing program, we do are disproportionately a huge car lender and so these are criteria that are meaning full to us and at this part of the cycle its causing us to lose volume. Eric Wasserstrom : Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And I know there's been many questions on OpEx, but I'm afraid I'm still a little confused. I understand certainly where you're coming out in terms of the efficiency ratio. But just in absolute dollar terms, relative to the roughly $52.4 billion that you had in 2016, how should we think about that figure in absolute terms for this year? John Shrewsberry : So the way that I would think about it is, thinking about it from the expense ratio, and I know it\u2019s a little bit frustrating, because again one of the reasons why we think about expenses here is part of that efficiency ratio as its very much a function of revenue opportunities and depending upon which business is generating those revenue opportunities or which product some of them have higher or lower expenses associated with them. But the way that I would think about that $2 billion is we\u2019re going to save that $2 billion over the next couple of years and then we\u2019re going to reinvest it in the business. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : This tags onto Gerard's question. In looking at your new compensation scheme and the fact that it's fairly new, how confident are you in projecting, accruing, et cetera, for comp expenses this year? Were you able to beta test this at all? Or is there wide variability in where the numbers can come out? John Shrewsberry : So, we were able to test it somewhat Nancy, but as you can appreciate the timeframe that we have was a little bit shorter than we would normally have liked. Nancy Bush : Right. John Shrewsberry : I don\u2019t want to give you the impression that we\u2019re always changing incentive compensation plans for tens of thousands of people in 90 days. So, there is some risk in that we didn\u2019t get it completely right and that\u2019s one of the reasons why I wanted to reinforce the point, and we\u2019re going to watching this very closely and to the extent that we need to make some changes, we\u2019re not going to wait for a year from now, we\u2019ll make some changes. But, when I think about the fundamentals of the plan, they were reviewed by Mary and team, we had a lot of discussions with the retail folks, we had it reviewed by our risk folks and HR folks and the likes, and just the fundamentals of basing it on customer service, increasing in primary accounts and household growth, I mean those are all measurable items. Nancy Bush : Right. John Shrewsberry : So, we\u2019re not really concerned about having the accruals correct or incorrect. And they\u2019re all very important drivers for growth in relationships and in return satisfied customers and then that will translate into revenue growth overtime. Nancy Bush : Yes. And, secondly, there was another piece of news in the last couple of days where you've gotten a letter, I think, from some members of Congress about the growth in overdraft charges, could you just -- and whether this is somehow linked to the rest of the issues. So, if you could just address that whole overdraft issue, I'd appreciate it. Tim Sloan : Sure. So, I\u2019ll start and John jump in. I\u2019m actually waiting to get the letter. So, you\u2019ve read about it before I've actually received it, but my understanding is that it was based upon some earlier reporting regarding year-to-year increases. Recall that in 2014 we made a number of changes in terms of how we provide information to our customers, how we process payments and deposits and debits and credits and the like, which meant that our deposit or our overdraft income actually declined in 2015 to 2014 and so the year-over-year, again three quarters to three quarters comparison you're seeing '16 to '15 is a reflection of the changes we made in '14, revenue decline in '15 and then growing off that number and the reason it\u2019s growing is not because there's anything nefarious that we're doing or it's part of any sort of retail sales practices issue. It's just a reflection of the fact that we're seeing growth in our customer base and we're seeing more customer activity. We think maybe our competitors are making some of the changes that we made a year later and so maybe that's impacting some of their overdraft revenue, but we'll -- I'll be responsive to the letter when I get it and we'll continue to provide the right services to our customer base. John Shrewsberry : Just a little bit more color on that. So we don\u2019t have the largest overdraft revenue base among larger banks. As Tim said we made this change and specifically the change that we made was to post to customers online and mobile account picture items that were being received throughout the course of the day that we're going to post overnight in a batch, so that they have that information before making a determination about whether to overdraft or not. We implemented that at the end of '14 and from '14 to '15 and that's good for customers. It was on purpose, it was intended to give people more information to make better decisions about what to do with their money and we dropped an overdraft revenue from '14 to '15 and then as Tim said because the business has grown, because people have gotten used to that information and made different decisions about how they want to run their lives. We picked back from '15 to '16. We're flat from '14 to '16. As we understand it, our peers adopted that similar customer friendly technology a year later and so the point of comparison that is available now is their year of adoption versus the period right afterward when customers can react to that information. So it's a little bit of apples and oranges. But our fee levels, our frequency of charging et cetera are right in the middle of the fairway compared to the competitive set, there's nothing different about Wells Fargo's approach to that activity. Tim Sloan : And Nancy the more that we can provide information to our customers so that they can make good decisions about how to manage their money, the better. And we're going to continue to look at ways in which we can use technology particularly through mobile to provide that information, so it\u2019s much more customer friendly to them. Nancy Bush : Okay, alright thank you. Operator : And I'll now turn the conference back over to management for any concluding remarks. Tim Sloan : Great, well again thank you all for spending time with us today, know it's been, it's been a very busy morning for all of you and we appreciate your interest in Wells Fargo and I also just want to reinforce to all of our team members who are listening out there, thank you very much for just a tremendous effort this quarter in the midst of a very challenging period for Wells Fargo, I couldn't be more proud of everything that you've accomplished. So, thank you and have a good rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin the conference. Jim Rowe : Thank you, Regina and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Tim Sloan. Tim Sloan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and I want to thank you for joining us today on the call. We produced solid financial results in the first quarter. It has been 7 months since the retail sales practices settlements, and we continued to take important steps in making things right with our customers and rebuilding trust. I want to start by acknowledging the hard work and dedication of our team members throughout Wells Fargo who are focused on putting our customers first and helping them succeed financially. This commitment has been demonstrated through our improving retail banking customer service scores, record client assets in wealth and investment management, including banker-closed referrals once again reaching $1 billion a month, more primary consumer checking customers and industry leading mortgage originations during the quarter. Before I provide more details on the actions we have taken and an update on the monthly customer activity trends we have been sharing regularly, let me briefly summarize our financial results on the first \u2013 of the first quarter. We generated earnings of $5.5 billion and EPS of $1. We generated $22 billion in revenue, reflecting lower fee income from a year ago, which was partially offset by a 5% increase in net interest income. Average loans grew $36.4 billion, up 4% from a year ago and average deposits increased $79.8 billion, up 7% to a record $1.3 trillion. Our credit results improved with a net charge-off rate of 34 basis points, and we had a 200 million reserve release. We returned $3.1 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. This reduced our common shares outstanding by over 19 million shares from the fourth quarter, bringing our shares outstanding below 5 billion shares for the first time since 2009. During the first quarter, our efficiency ratio increased to 62.7%. And even taking into consideration normal first quarter seasonality, it is outside our range. John will discuss the drivers of this increase later on the call, but I want to make it very clear that operating at this level is not acceptable. We are committed to improving our efficiency in addition to our current efficiency initiatives, which are expected to reduce expenses by $2 billion annually with those savings being reinvested in the business. We will talk more about specific areas of cost saves and reinvestments at our Investor Day in May. March retail banking customer activity is shown on Slide 3, which we have been updating monthly since October. It is encouraging that most of these trends have improved from their post sales practices settlement lows and many have continued to improve throughout the first quarter. Starting with customer interactions on an average per day basis, total branch interactions declined 6% from February and declined 4% from a year ago. The year-over-year decline was less than we have seen in recent months and March has historically had fewer interactions per day than February. We had strong growth in digital secure sessions, up 8% from a year ago as our customers are increasingly using our online and award-winning mobile capabilities. Deposit balances remained strong and customers opened more checking accounts than they closed. Our attrition rates are now back to pre-settlement levels. We had 23.6 million primary consumer checking customers in March with the second consecutive month-over-month increase. Primary consumer checking customers increased 1.6% from a year ago. We do expect this growth rate to continue to decline in the near-term driven by year-over-year decline in checking account openings. However, the growth in average consumer and small business banking deposits has remained strong, up 6% from a year ago. And activity among our debit and credit card customers also remained strong, with debit card transactions and consumer credit purchase \u2013 consumer credit card purchase volume both up 5% from a year ago on an average per day basis. In addition, consumer credit card balances grew 7% from a year ago. New consumer credit card applications increased 10% from February on an average per day basis, the largest month-over-month increase in September, but were still down from a year ago. Point-of-sale active consumer credit card accounts were up 4% from a year ago. Our team members remain focused on providing outstanding customer service and our retail customer experience scores have improved for 5 consecutive months. Overall, satisfaction with most recent visit scores are near pre-settlement levels and customer loyalty scores have steadily improved from the lows in October of 2016. While not part of our regular monthly reporting, I want to highlight trends in referred investment assets. We have talked in the past about the successful partnership between wealth and investment management and community banking, which was averaging more than $1 billion in monthly closed referred investment assets prior to the sales practices settlement. In March, closed referred investment assets from this partnership increased to $1 billion, up from $700 million per month, which is what we have been averaging during the months after the settlement announcement. We are pleased that the results from this important partnership have rebounded, which is an indication that our bankers and financial advisors are focused on meeting our customer\u2019s financial needs and that we are competing successfully. We implemented our new retail banking compensation program early in the first quarter and initial survey results from our team members have been positive. We are also seeing an improvement in team member retention. We will continue to survey our team members, monitor the outcomes and behaviors, and we will make changes as needed. Another important step forward we are making is the launch of a new marketing campaign next week called Building Better Every Day. It focuses on how we are building a better company for our customers, our team members, and our communities. Before I turn the call over to John, I want to acknowledge the release of the report from our board containing the findings of an independent investigation into retail sales practices in our Community Bank. This is available on our website. Also during the first quarter, our board accelerated its ongoing process of board refreshment by electing two talented new independent directors, Karen Peetz and Ron Sargent, to succeed long-serving board members. The issuance of the board\u2019s report, which was appropriately thorough was an important step in rebuilding trust. And we have made significant progress in making things right with our customers and addressing issues, including addressing several identified in the investigation. We changed leadership, held executives accountable, changed how we compensate and lead our retail bankers, and centralized key control functions. We have also launched our management commission third-party reviews of our culture and practices. In addition, we announced in March that we reached an agreement in principle to settle a class action lawsuit concerning retail banking sales practices for $110 million. We expect this settlement to resolve claims and 11 other pending class actions, another step in making things right with our customers and rebuilding trust. We also achieved some key milestones that are not related to sales practices, including filing our response to the two remaining deficiencies found in our 2015 resolution plan and we completed our latest capital plan submission earlier this month. We also recently introduced six new goals to our team members to better reflect our current challenges and opportunities. We want Wells Fargo to be the financial services leaders \u2013 leader in these six areas; customer service and advice, team member engagement, innovation, risk management, corporate citizenship and long-term shareholder value. We will share our specific strategies we are taking to help achieve these goals at our Investor Day. We have accomplished a lot in the past few months, but we still have work to do. We understand that nothing is more important to Wells Fargo\u2019s future than ensuring we have a culture and an operating model that works for all of our stakeholders, our customers, team members, investors and communities. John will now discuss our financial results in more detail. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Tim and good morning everyone. I am happy to report that we earned $5.5 billion in the first quarter, the 18th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. There was a lot of economic volatility and uncertainty over this period and these steady results reflected the benefit of our diversified business model and its ability to perform consistently over time. Turning to Page 6, let me highlight a few balance sheet trends. Our balance sheet remains strong with high levels of liquidity and capital, record deposit balances and improved credit quality. Loans were down from the fourth quarter and I will discuss that in more detail later on the call. Cash and short-term investments reached an all-time high of $328.4 billion, up $41.7 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth in deposits and a linked quarter decline in the loan portfolio. Investment securities were down $387 million, less than 1% in the first quarter as approximately $16 billion in gross purchases were more than offset by runoff in sales. We always balance a number of factors when determining our investment activity. And during this transitional period for rates, our decision to maintain a relatively stable investment portfolio was driven primarily by interest rate and OCI risk management. We will continue to analyze the outlook for interest rates as well as our liquidity needs and we look forward to reinvesting more into loans and investment securities over time. Turning to the income statement overview on Page 7, I will be describing the biggest drivers of revenue and expense growth later on the call, so there was a couple of things \u2013 points I want to make here. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 27.4%, which included $197 million of discrete tax benefits, of which $183 million was associated with newly adopted stock compensation accounting guidance in the first quarter. We currently expect the full year 2017 effective income tax rate to be approximately 30%. We had $403 million of equity gains in the first quarter from a number of venture capital, private equity and other investments, partially offset by $91 million of non-controlling interests, primarily related to these gains. As shown on Page 8, average loans increased 4% from a year ago, but declined $502 million from the fourth quarter as $5 billion of broad based growth in commercial loans was more than offset by declines in consumer loans, primarily in residential real estate. The benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 6 basis points in the quarter. Period end loans grew 1% from a year ago and declined $9.2 billion or 1% from the fourth quarter. H.8 data indicates there was softness across the industry in the first quarter and our growth rate was in line with that national trend. There were a variety of factors impacting our portfolio, so let me discuss these trends in more detail. Commercial loans were up $16.8 billion from a year ago, but were down $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter. We have not changed our relationship based approach to meeting the lending needs of our commercial customers. Our commercial customers are generally optimistic about the current environment and this positive sentiment should lead to more loan growth as business activity and investing increase. C&I loans declined $1.6 billion from the fourth quarter as $4.5 billion in growth from Wells Fargo capital finance, asset backed financing and commercial dealer services was more than offset by businesses with typical first quarter declines, including a $2 billion decline in short-term loans to global financial institutions. We had continued declines in our oil and gas portfolio, which was down 29% from a year ago and down $2 billion or 14% from the fourth quarter. The linked quarter decline was spread across all oil and gas sectors and roughly half of the reduction was from proceeds the borrowers raised in the capital markets and used to pay down loans. The strong capital markets environment also resulted in additional payoffs of C&I loans from other borrowers. The commercial real estate portfolio increased $189 million in the fourth quarter with growth in the commercial real estate construction, which was diversified across geographies and asset types, partially offset by declines in commercial real estate mortgages, driven by pay-downs. We summarized our consumer loan portfolios on Page 10. Our first mortgage loans declined $946 million from the fourth quarter due to continued runoff of higher yielding legacy portfolios, more than offsetting $4.1 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans. Our junior lien mortgage portfolio continued to decline as payoffs offset new originations. Our credit card portfolio declined $2 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonal activity as customers paid down their holiday purchases. Growth was also impacted by a slowdown in account openings, which started in the first quarter of 2016 and increased after the announcement of the sales practices settlement. The $1.9 billion decline in our auto portfolio reflected lower origination volumes, which were down 29% compared with a year ago. We have tightened credit underwriting standards in response to early signs of rising delinquencies in the industry and declining used car values. As a result, the quality of originations has improved and we expect to see the size of our auto portfolio continue to decline in 2017. We recently named a new leader to this business and we are focused on improving execution and efficiency through increased standardization and centralization. We will show more \u2013 we will share more about our auto strategy at Investor Day. Other revolving credit and installment loans declined by $981 million with $539 million of the decline from personal loans and lines reflecting lower branch originations. As highlighted on Page 11, our first quarter average deposits were a record $1.3 trillion, up $79.8 billion or 7% from a year ago with growth in both consumer and commercial deposits. Our average deposit costs increased 7 basis points from a year ago and 5 basis points from the fourth quarter. We have not made any material changes in rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits and we have seen very little market response with the majority of our peers holding rates steady. We have implemented some incremental commercial deposit re-pricing in line with the market from the rate increases in December \u201816 and March of \u201817 and we will continue to monitor the overall market and be responsive in order to remain competitive. Net interest income increased 5% from a year ago, primarily driven by growth in loans and investment securities and the benefit of higher interest rates. Net interest income declined $102 million from the fourth quarter, primarily due to two fewer days in the quarter. The benefit from the interest rate increases as well as growth in average investment securities was offset by lower average trading assets and mortgages held for sale and typically lower first quarter income from variable sources. The net interest margin was flat from the fourth quarter as the benefit of higher interest rates, a reduction in short-term market funding and growth in average investment securities was offset by lower income from trading assets and mortgages held for sale, higher deposit and long-term debt balances and lower income from variable sources. Non-interest income increased $522 million from the fourth quarter, driven by a lower net hedge ineffectiveness accounting impact in the fourth quarter as well as higher trading gains. Net hedge ineffectiveness accounting impacts are reflected in other income. And in the first quarter, we had a loss of $193 million largely from lower foreign currency fluctuations, compared with a loss of $592 million in the fourth quarter due to key interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. A year ago, we had net hedge ineffectiveness accounting gains of $379 million. The current accounting rules caused volatility, which we believe do not reflect the actual underlying economics. So we are pleased the FASB has issued an exposure draft on hedge accounting guidelines, which if adopted in its current form, will significantly reduce the interest rate related ineffectiveness associated with our long-term debt hedges. Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $189 million from the fourth quarter. As expected, residential mortgage origination volume declined due to lower refi volume and seasonally lower purchase volume. Applications were down 21% from the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter with a $28 billion unclosed pipeline, down 7%. The production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 168 basis points in the first quarter, unchanged from the fourth quarter. Given current industry pricing trends, we expect the production margin to decline in the second quarter. Mortgage servicing income increased $260 million from the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower un-reimbursed servicing costs and lower prepayments. We took actions last year that increased these un-reimbursed servicing costs, primarily in the fourth quarter. These costs are now at more normalized levels and we currently expect them to improve slightly from first quarter levels. On Page 14, we provide details on trading-related revenue and the impact to net interest income and non-interest income. Trading-related revenue was up $448 million from the fourth quarter. Trading-related net interest income declined $100 million in the first quarter, reflecting a 9% decline in average trading assets, tighter spreads and lower periodic dividends and carry. Net gains on trading activities increased $548 million from the fourth quarter. This growth was primarily driven by higher client volumes and credit trading, equity trading and derivatives. $144 million of the increase in net gains in trading activities was from higher deferred comp trading results, which was largely offset in employee benefits expense. And there was a $65 million increase from valuation adjustments as credit valuation adjustments on tightening spreads in investment grade and high yield debt were partially offset by debt valuation adjustments from tightening in Wells Fargo market spreads. As shown on Page 15, expenses increased $577 million from the fourth quarter and $764 million from a year ago and our efficiency ratio increased to 62.7%. As Tim mentioned earlier on the call, this ratio is unacceptable. And while we expect our efficiency ratio to remain elevated, we are committed to improving our efficiency. On Page 16, we highlight the drivers of the expense increase from the fourth quarter. We had $900 million of higher personnel expenses. $790 million of this increase was from seasonally higher employee benefits expenses from higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching as well as annual equity awards to retirement eligible team members. These seasonally higher personnel expenses will decline in the second quarter, but salary expense is expected to increase, reflecting annual salary increases which became effective late in the first quarter. Partially offsetting higher personnel expenses in the first quarter was the decline in expenses that are typically high in the fourth quarter, including outside professional services, equipment, advertising and T&E. We also had higher operating losses in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter on higher litigation accruals. On Page 17, we show the drivers of the $764 million increase in expenses from a year ago. Over 60% of the increase was personnel expense. Salary expense increased $225 million, reflecting annual salary increases in FTE growth. FTEs are up approximately roughly 4,200 or 2% from a year ago driven by increases in technology, risk, virtual channels and operations. These are non-revenue generating areas and are higher than average salaried team members. Employee benefits expense increased $160 million, including $141 million in higher deferred comp costs, which was offset in trading revenue. Incentive compensation was up $80 million from a year ago, with approximately 40% of the increase from higher revenue-related incentive compensation costs. Our efficiency initiative, which includes centralization and streamlining of processes, should reduce FTE levels over time. And in some businesses like mortgage, FTE levels will be adjusted to reflect market conditions. $264 million of the increase in expenses was from outside professional and contract services related to higher project and technology spending and legal expense. The first quarter included approximately $80 million of expense related to sales practices matters and meaningful spending on regulatory and compliance initiatives, including regulatory and risk data, resolution planning and Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs. While we do not expect these expenses to decline in the near-term, over time, we should be able to spend less on these areas. We also had $83 million in higher FDIC expense due to the special assessment, which began in the third quarter of 2016 and is expected to continue through mid-2018. The purchase of the GE Capital CDF business and the sale of our crop insurance business increased expenses by a net $23 million. These two business mix changes were reflected in our results beginning in the second quarter of 2016. They will no longer impact year-over-year variances. Finally, there were $101 million of other expense increases driven by higher equipment spending and charitable donations. These higher expenses were partially offset by $172 million of lower operating losses on lower litigation accruals in the first quarter compared with a year ago. As highlighted on Page 18, we remained focused on expense management and efficiency. While many of the higher expenses I just described will remain elevated, it\u2019s important that we operate in the most efficient way possible. As we discussed last quarter, we have been working on a number of initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year end 2018, with the full year benefit starting in 2019. However, there will not be a bottom line impact as these savings will be reinvested in the business. We will provide more detail on these efforts at Investor Day. We are committed to improving our efficiency while continuing to invest in our top priorities, including risk management, cybersecurity and innovation. We will be highlighting a lot of new innovations at Investor Day, including our recently launched card-free ATMs, making us the first large bank in the U.S. to offer the feature for our entire ATM network. We are also the first bank to integrate accelerated user interface into our mobile app, enabling our customers to use this enhanced functionality in making person-to-person payments. And we were recently awarded first place in the Keynote Mobile Banking scorecard for our overall mobile banking offering. We also entered into an agreement with Intuit, which allows Wells Fargo customers to use financial management tools such as QuickBooks Online, to use an API when importing their bank information, giving our customers greater control over their financial data. You will see more announcements like these as we continue to invest to bring more ease and convenience to our customers. Turning to our business segments starting on Page 19, community banking earned $3 billion in the first quarter, down 9% from a year ago and up 10% from the fourth quarter. Community banking results benefited from the discrete tax benefit I highlighted earlier on the call. I have already discussed many of the business trends within community banking. So, I won\u2019t go into more detail here, except to note that we closed 39 branches in the quarter and we are on schedule to close approximately 200 this year. Wholesale banking earned $2.1 billion in the first quarter, up 10% from a year ago and down 4% from the fourth quarter. Revenue was up modestly compared with a year ago, as 11% growth in net interest income was mostly offset by a 10% decline in non-interest income. The decline in non-interest income was driven by the impact from the sale of our crop insurance business last year, which generated a $381 million gain in the first quarter of \u201816. Wealth and investment management earned $623 million in the first quarter, up 22% from a year ago and down 5% for the fourth quarter. First quarter results reflected strong growth in net interest income, up 14% from a year ago. Average deposits were up 6% and average loans increased 10% from a year ago, the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year loan growth. The benefit of higher market valuations and continued positive net flows led to another quarter of record WIM total client assets, up 9% from a year ago, to $1.8 trillion. Turning to Page 22, net charge-offs decreased $100 million from the fourth quarter with 34 basis points of annualized net charge-offs. Commercial losses declined $108 million, driven by $76 million of lower losses in our oil and gas portfolio and from higher recoveries. Consumer losses increased $8 million as lower losses in residential real estate and other revolving credit were offset by seasonally higher credit card losses. We had a reserve release of $200 million driven by improvements in the oil and gas portfolio performance and continued improvement in residential real estate. Our first mortgage loan portfolio had only 1 basis point of loss in the first quarter. And our junior lien mortgage portfolio continued to improve with 21 basis points of loss, which is less than half of the loss rate from a year ago. Non-performing assets continued to decline, down $698 million from the fourth quarter, with improvements across our portfolios and lower foreclosed assets. Turning to Page 23, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in increased to 11.2% in the first quarter. Our internal target of 10%, which includes the regulatory minimum and buffers and our internal buffer has not changed. The primary driver of our ratio remaining above our internal target this quarter was lower RWA than last quarter and lower than forecasted in our 2016 capital plan, resulting from loan growth trends, continued credit discipline and improved RWA efficiency. We returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter through common stock dividends and net share repurchases and our net payout ratio was 61%. Based on our updated TLAC estimate as of the end of the quarter, we believe our shortfall is approximately $1.4 billion. This represents strong continued progress towards fulfilling the requirements and results largely from lower RWA as well as issuance during the quarter. We currently expect our total TLAC issuance in 2017 to be similar to the $32 billion we issued in 2016 to fund both maturities and our remaining build of qualifying debt. In summary, our results in the first quarter, which included 1.15% ROA and 11.54% ROE and a 13.85% return on tangible common equity demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model, which has generated over $5 billion in quarterly earnings every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2012. We look forward to our Investor Day next month where we will share our strategies for acquiring new customers, building lifelong relationships with our existing customers and our focus on generating operational efficiencies while managing risk. And we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Tim Sloan : Good morning Erika. Erika Najarian : I just have a clarification question, you both mentioned on the call in the prepared remarks that the 62.7% efficiency ratio is not acceptable, but you\u2019ve also emphasized that the $2 billion currently identified cost savings won\u2019t fall to the bottom line and your NII was down in a period where the Fed raised rates in December by 25 bps, so how do we square future efficiency ratio improvement from here when those two big pieces seem to be going the other way? Tim Sloan : Sure. So let me start and John jump in and let\u2019s talk about the revenue line first. You are absolutely right, the net interest income was down from the fourth quarter, but that was because there were two fewer days in the quarter. And as John pointed out, net interest income year-over-year was up about 5%. So we feel comfortable that we are going to see continued net interest income growth over the rest of the year. We can talk about that more latter if you would like. In terms of efficiency, as I highlighted and as you know, the first quarter tends to be a bit higher because of the compensation related activities that are concentrated in that first quarter. Even when you strip those out, and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we wanted to provide the detail about our expenses, not only year-over-year, but also sequential quarter, you will see an increase in our expenses. And so even without that first quarter seasonality, we would have been operating outside the range that we have talked about historically of between 55% and 59%. And as I have said and as John said, operating outside that range from our perspective is just not acceptable. Now, as it relates to the $2 billion of reductions that we have talked about previously, again as you highlighted, all those are going to be reinvested in growing the company and making the necessary investments for our success over the long-term. In addition to that, we appreciate that we need to improve the efficiencies of this company. And we are going to provide more detail about how we are going to make those improvements at Investor Day. So imagine on Investor Day, we are talking \u2013 we will be talking about additional efficiencies that would fall to the bottom line beyond that $2 billion. John Shrewsberry : One thing I would add, I think we will provide some more clarity at Investor Day that the $2 billion that we are talking about reinvesting, we are essentially reinvesting it today, and so there is a little bit of\u2013 there needs to be more clarity I think on the \u2013 on just the time element of what happens to the $2 billion to the extent that we are already in an elevated situation. And from point, it would be contributing to the bottom line at that point, if not from \u2013 from the more efficient place that we were recently. So it\u2019s not as if we operate outside our range today for example and then we came up with $2 billion of efficiency, we would spend another $2 billion. It\u2019s contributing to paying for what was \u2013 is elevated today. Erika Najarian : That was clear. Thank you. Just on the net income side Tim, thank you for bringing that up. You have in a very low and a low rate environment been consistent over the past couple of years at growing this in the mid-single digits and I am wondering if we take into account a better rate backdrop and also account for some of the runoffs that you told us to expect, I am wondering if this year, you could do better than that mid-single-digit pace? Tim Sloan : Well, we hope so Erika, I think we are comfortable with the range that we have provided. And on one hand for example just in the last few weeks, we have seen short-term rates increase, which is helpful. On the other hand, we have seen a pretty significant rally in long-term rates. And so it\u2019s a mixed bag, but I think we are generally comfortable. John, I don\u2019t know if you want to\u2026? John Shrewsberry : No. I think that\u2019s right. So where short-term rates are and are going is a big part of it, where long-term rates are matters a lot, because we generate interest income by investing at the longer end of the curve. And to the extent that, that outlook is lower than it was earlier in the quarter, then it will be harder to generate incremental growth net interest income from that activity. We have to have a good handle on where both deposits and loans are going to be growing, and there is nothing to suggest that we feel comfortable in the mid--to-high single-digits frankly in the ongoing deposit growth and loans are probably in the low-single digits. So that has to be factored in. And then the deposit response, the realized betas that the market is offering and that we are taking will be the big swing factor. And we will observe that over time. I think as we have said and I think have heard already this morning, it feels like there hasn\u2019t been much of a move on consumer and small business deposit pricing from the last couple of moves. To the extent that we got a couple of more moves and realized betas begin to pick up and what feels like out-performance today could be tougher later in the cycle. All that will matter. Erika Najarian : Just if I could slip one more question and I apologize, but in putting it all together and what you know now in terms of the realistic outlook and what you have planned for the rest of the year, can Wells Fargo get back in that 55% to 59% range this year? Tim Sloan : Erika, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge to do that in terms of averaging that for the year. My guess is we will be at the high end of that range. But as you have pointed out in your questions and as John\u2019s pointed out, there is a lot of puts and takes to get to what an efficiency ratio looks like. It\u2019s not only a function of expense level, but it\u2019s also revenue level. But I think that operating at an elevated level, as we\u2019ve said, is something that you should expect. But again long-term, that\u2019s not our goal and that\u2019s not our expectation. John Shrewsberry : And we should have some more clarity for you at Investor Day as well. Erika Najarian : Thanks. I appreciate it. Tim Sloan : Thank you. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot. John, I wonder if you could talk more about that OCI risk management and the trade-off between that longer part of the curve, when we saw in your 10-K that the unrealized loss component did go up and it seems like you did reinvest a little less this quarter, can you just talk about like the balance between your decision tree on putting more into the book here and versus balance sheet risk and the decision tree between investment securities and maybe keeping more mortgages? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So in terms of keeping more mortgages, we have \u2013 keeping conforming mortgages on the books really hasn\u2019t been a tool that we have talked about. We have got \u2013 we are adding what we think is plenty in the way of that asset category on the non-conforming side. So for the moment anyway, that hasn\u2019t been a strategy that we have considered. With respect to the \u2013 to OCI sensitivity, the big topic since the election has been what\u2019s going to happen with long rates, are they going to make a move and I think the market was discounting for a while what the possibility was of meaningful tax reform, some form of infrastructure stimulus. And if both of those things get dropped on an economy with relatively full employment, that\u2019s inflationary. And if that happens, there is a very reasonably expectation of higher long-term rates. And with that as a backdrop, of course until it didn\u2019t happen at least in the short-term, preparing ourselves for a meaningful move up at the longer end of the curve both in terms of the capital impact of our existing stock of AFS securities as well as the decision around dry powder and whether you reinvest in the first quarter or the second quarter or the third quarter depending on where your entry points are, that has been a consistent topic. So, because that stimulus hasn\u2019t occurred, it still may, but certainly is lower probability today than it was in November and December. They were back down in lower 10-year rates, lower mortgage rates than we were there for a while. And now we have to ask ourselves again, are we going to be lower for a while, lower for longer or are we still awaiting for a shoe to drop in for there to be a big backup in rates? Sensitizing what that means to capital, for every 50, 75 or 100 basis point move in the 10-year and mortgage yields, that\u2019s the risk that we are trying to manage as we navigate. And the trade-off of course is carry in the short-term. We had positioned ourselves very heavily invested lower for longer in an outspoken way before the election. And now we are contemplating what profile to maintain going forward. We want to have \u2013 we want to retain or frankly maybe even increase our asset sensitivity which is \u2013 which we have talked about sort of 5% to 15% at the lower end of the range. And every incremental decision we make to get invested to turn cash into HQLA reduces that asset sensitivity. So if we are in the rising rate environment, one way for us to preserve that \u2013 one way, there are others \u2013 is to delay investments in the fixed rate securities we would otherwise make. That\u2019s what we are talking about. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then as a follow-up to that just on that last point about the asset sensitivity then, I think you guys had talked about previously what you thought the December hike would mean for first quarter. Can you talk about \u2013 I know this goes back to your point about betas, but has the sensitivity changed much inter-quarter here with the betas and the fixing out of that cash into securities? Can you just give us an idea of what the next hike might mean to NII? John Shrewsberry : Well, it\u2019s hard to parse each piece. We sort of outperformed our expectation in the first quarter, because deposit prices didn\u2019t react the way that we had originally modeled them. But we have to imagine how the market pricing will react for each subsequent move. When you put all the pieces in, a few moves, loan growth, deposit growth, investment activity, I think that sort of mid single-digit NII growth over the course of the year is a reasonable expectation. There are other things in there as well. But looking at the first quarter, looking at where we are and maybe with room to miss on the upside, that\u2019s how I would think about it right now. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, John. I wanted to ask about the efficiency initiatives slide, Slide 18. I guess the first thing is can you tell us the relevant size of the three main buckets of phase? Are they in size order, like centralization optimization is the big source there? John Shrewsberry : So, I would say that the first bucket is half and the other two buckets comprise the other half. John McDonald : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And how much in branch reductions, can you just remind us how much in branch reductions are in there on the second bucket? John Shrewsberry : We are behind that, yes. Tim Sloan : Yes. John, my suggestion is we will provide you with more detail on that at Investor Day. I think there is \u2013 that\u2019s not a significant part of this $2 billion. We really came up with this $2 billion initiative prior to the beginning of the reduction in branches that we have talked about for this year. And as you know that you generally don\u2019t get the benefit of any sort of reduction or the expense reduction for branches in that first year. It tends to lag just a little bit. But we will provide some more detail in that in John\u2019s presentation and in Mary\u2019s presentation at Investor Day. John McDonald : Okay. I guess I was just kind of getting at how the branch rationalization is going and what would drive you to accelerate the branch reductions or is it just too early to make that call right now? John Shrewsberry : It\u2019s a little early, but we will be updating our approach with each passing quarter. So even though we said 200 a year for 2 years, we will learn from the process that we are going through. And I think the presentation that Mary will give at Investor Day will very specifically describe the criteria that we are using, why these and why these now and what we will be looking forward to make decisions around incremental ones going forward. And I think that should be pretty transparent and helpful. And just I think I mentioned it earlier, but we have closed about 40 in the first quarter and are on track for the 200 for this year. John McDonald : Okay. And then just elsewhere on expenses, with the board review done, how long could \u2013 would you \u2013 you expect the professional fees to be elevated in the range that you highlighted on Slide 17? John Shrewsberry : I would expect them to be elevated for a while, because the board review was certainly part of it. It was conducted by an outside firm and that cost rolls through that line item. Recall that in connection with the consent orders, we have \u2013 there are a couple of outside firms that are doing major reviews internally. And then separately, we did something similar outside or in addition to the consent order to look at every part of the sales practices of our firm with actually another third-party. We have got programs around cyber, programs around data, programs in a handful of areas that are all at least in part relying on some combination of outside professional services firms and/or contract services firms, contract labor. So, some of those will be around for several quarters, even though the board report is done. John McDonald : Okay. And John, they were running a little higher than your previous targeted range, just comment on why that is? John Shrewsberry : Yes. Well, so in the first quarter, with outside professional services firms, some of that is sort of their billing cycle, etcetera. So, we estimated I think 50 to 60 a quarter ago. In the quarter or I\u2019d say now at least for the next couple of quarters, it looks more like 70 to 80. We will give a quarterly update on that to provide transparency and try and be as accurate as we can. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hi, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Along the lines of what John McDonald was just asking about, I just want to dig a little bit deeper on that side around expenses, whether it be on the branch side, 200 a year and also just looking at the size of the bank in the different businesses and the different markets you are in. It feels like when you look at it on paper that you have a lot more room than potentially the $2 billion to pullback on costs in order to address the efficiency ratio this year. Is that something where you are actually maybe considering where you could come up with a bigger number for us as you look at this and as you are looking at the Investor Day here? Is that something that we could \u2013 that is possible as you look at the franchise more on a near-term basis? Tim Sloan : Yes, John, I would look forward to that at Investor Day. I mean, just to reinforce, right, 62.7% efficiency ratio, even taking out the seasonality in the first quarter is too high. We\u2019ve got a $2 billion expense initiative that we have talked about a little over the last few quarters that is primarily focused on reinvesting for the long-term. In addition to that, we appreciate that we have got to improve our operating efficiency \u2013 our expense efficiency ratio and you will see more about that in Investor Day and you should expect a bigger number. John Pancari : Okay, alright, great. Thank you. And then separately if I could just ask along the CCAR side, can you give us your updated thoughts around your positioning for CCAR, particularly given the living will issues you had, the sales practice issue, the CRA, all that type of stuff? How are you feeling about CCAR for this year, particularly from the standpoint of your qualitative \u2013 the qualitative aspect of it? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : We are feeling thorough, helpful and cooperative as it relates to CCAR this year. A big part of CCAR is the expectation that firms do a great job at identifying their own risks and addressing their risks in their forecasting and they are laying their capital plan on top of that with that realistic assessment. We think we have done a very good job of that. Of course it\u2019s early in the review cycle. So we will know as time passes. But we are very self-aware of the possibilities of the areas for criticism or skepticism based on our own peculiar specific circumstances. And we think we have accounted for that. We\u2019ve been transparent, cooperative and had a lot of discussion with our regulators. But now we are in the process. We have done a good job of this before. We think we are doing a good job at it now. We think we have positioned ourselves for it, but now we are in the review. John Pancari : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Tim Sloan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I had a question last quarter, you mentioned that you had proactively decided to keep I think it\u2019s the non-bank balance sheet in line with September 30 levels, I am just wondering if you persisted in that this quarter? John Shrewsberry : We have persisted in that this quarter. We did that just as a cautionary approach, because if you recall the feedback that we got around resolution planning, it said that if we didn\u2019t appropriately remediate the identified deficiencies with the passage of time that one of the next step remedies that the regulators maintain and could take was to ask us to roll back our balance sheet size to September 30 of last year. So just because we wouldn\u2019t want to put ourselves in a position of having to make an abrupt change for something that was out of our control, we decided to leave things at that level and they are still operating there today. Betsy Graseck : So could you just remind us what it takes to get that approval to put more balancing to work in non-bank, I am guessing that that constraint weighed somewhat on your revenue relative to if you hadn\u2019t have to have that constraint and maybe give us a sense as to what kind of potential you could see as you are able to reallocate capital to that business? John Shrewsberry : Sure. So I think we mentioned that in part, our net interest income was impacted to about $100 million for our average trading assets being lower. In part, that would have related to keeping them at a level that was underneath the cap that we put in place. So I think that, that could be a placeholder for the impact. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s preventing us from conducting the business that we want to conduct. And what it would take us for to change of course is there \u2013 the acceptance of our remediation approach to the deficiencies that we filed on 3/31. And then also frankly the review of our 7/1 plan, right we are all on a new resolution planning cycle. And we all, meaning the banking community, we need to get feedback on that plan to make sure that it\u2019s well understood what the profile of our non-bank activity means to our preferred approach to resolution. So my expectation is that we will probably be around where we are today or maybe somewhat higher until we go through this full resolution planning cycle. Betsy Graseck : And that\u2019s another three quarters or four quarters, I am just wondering how long you think that is? John Shrewsberry : We file on 7/1. It\u2019s hard to say what the response time is for that. We could get more information or have a better understanding between now and then or during the process afterwards. But on the one hand, there isn\u2019t a pent-up demand for an excessive amount of incremental assets in that business. So it\u2019s not \u2013 well, we want to be able to serve all of our customers and have flexibility there. That\u2019s valuable, but it\u2019s not something that is waiting to happen. And then on the other hand, the timeframes are uncertain because this is \u2013 we are not in control of that process. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Tim Sloan : Hi Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: So you have given us a lot of detail and a couple of examples of kind of depressed profitability and what I am trying to get out is aggregating some of the drags from the regulatory and sales issues, so \u2013 sales practice issues, you just mentioned there might be $100 million drag in trading versus what you could otherwise do over time, you pointed to $80 million of sales practice expenses and you kind of implied there were some other expenses, but I am just wondering if you can kind of aggregate all in as you think about the drag to profitability that you are experiencing now, how much would that total as I would assume it\u2019s something that you are thinking about internally a lot? Tim Sloan : Matt, it\u2019s a very fair question. I think it\u2019s difficult to pinpoint an exact number, though again, I understand why you are interested. I think the way that I would maybe try to categorize things is that the sale \u2013 retail sales practices issues primarily impacted our retail banking business. So when you look at the progress that we have made in terms of customer experience scores, customer loyalty, you have seen the increase in the number of primarily checking accounts and so on. You would see progress from the lows of the fourth quarter. And you are \u2013 in many of the metrics, you are seeing progress throughout the first quarter. But they are certainly not back to pre-settlement levels, right. And so my expectation is that over time, we will continue to make progress. I think Mary and her team in community banking are doing a great job, we talked about the success with Mary and David\u2019s team in terms of the wealth and community banking partnership. And so I think that that\u2019s where I would focus on. Clearly, we have seen a reduction in new account openings, in credit card. And my guess is that when you look at the annualized numbers, we will \u2013 you will continue to see some deterioration in the second quarter and then we will begin to rebound from that. But that\u2019s where I would focus on the retail side. For the rest of the company, I know you look at wholesale banking year-over-year, up 10%, if you look at wealth and investment management year-over-year, up 22%. I mean both of those businesses had some of the best quarters in their history. So we have got some challenges on the retail side. We are very focused on that. But I think the rest of the bank is continuing to perform well and the retail bank business is really performing better than the lowest points in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yes. What I am trying to get at is, is there revenue that\u2019s being suppressed from all of this, because there is a lot of metrics out there that it\u2019s hard to translate some of these retail banking metrics into revenues, the existing customer base seems to be performing well, if we look at your credit card balances overall, the fee revenues, so I think part of the pieces [ph] on the stock would be that you are under-earning now because of some of these issues impacting both revenue and expenses and I am just trying to square a lot of disclosures that are out there with that and again, you have provide us some metrics on the revenue expense, which is helpful, but that\u2019s really the angle that I am coming from? Tim Sloan : Yes. I understand Matt. I mean look, we always think we are under-earning, right. So it\u2019s not \u2013 we don\u2019t want to get away from that, the fact that we think that we can continue to grow this company. Clearly, we have had a difficult period in our history, right. But another one to highlight for example would be you look at credit card balance growth and fee growth, they are in the high single-digits over the last few years. And now, we have drifted down a bit. Can we get that back up, of course we can. Is it going to happen in the next month, no. But it\u2019s going to happen over time. And again, I would look at the detailed metrics that we provided as it relates to the retail business. Look at where we were historically, where we are now, the pace of recovery and then step back and make some educated guesses. And my guess is that you will probably be right. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then a bigger picture question related to the theme just in terms of how much time is senior management still spending on kind of all of these issues and you can include from a regulatory perspective that\u2019s new in the last six months, the sales practices, if you had a percentage that you had to put on how much time you, John and the business has put towards this. And then the same question for the line staff, because I would think at this point, the line staff is maybe starting to turn the page in terms of looking ahead more, but just trying to get a sense of maybe how things really feel inside at the different layers? Tim Sloan : So let me start. And then John jump in. I was in Arizona this week and in a few of our branches. I will tell you, for our team and our branches, they haven\u2019t turned the page. They are in a different book. They are out there serving our customers every day and they are making progress. And you see it in the numbers. I think that one of the keys to the progress that we have made over the last six months and we have accomplished a lot in a difficult environment. It\u2019s not to say we are not through it is that we task individuals to spend 100% of their time on some of the regulatory issues. For example, we talked about the fact publicly that we established the rebuilding trust office, meaning that we didn\u2019t want lots of people to be spending 10% and 15% of their time on some of these issues. We wanted them to spend 100% of their time. So we have created a new group and they are spending 100% of their time on some of the issues in and around their consent orders and some of the other remediation that were done. As it relates to senior management, it really depends on the business. It depends on the activity and it depends on the day. It\u2019s episodic. I would have to say some days, I am probably spending 100% of my time on some of these issues. And you know what, that\u2019s a great long-term investment. Because if we believe what we say, which is that rebuilding trust is the most important activity we can, I would better \u2013 I\u2019d spend 150% of my day on that. So, it\u2019s episodic, but I think everyday, we are continuing to make progress. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the progress that our team has made. I think they have made 9 months of progress in 6 months and they should be congratulated. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good. Thank you. A quick follow-up question maybe on the gain on sale, you mentioned you are expecting it to decline in the second quarter from the first quarter. I guess since we are so early in the quarter, what\u2019s driving that forecast down quarter-on-quarter? John Shrewsberry : I think its excess capacity in the industry of mortgage market is going to shrink to $1.5 trillion, $1.7 trillion worth of volume. And there was more last year than there are people who are going to try and price down to utilize as much capacity as they can. So, it may not be down a ton, but that\u2019s I think at the margin will be a difference maker. Brian Kleinhanzl : I mean, I guess we say down a ton. Are you looking at maybe 20 basis points off of the fourth quarter, 30 basis points? John Shrewsberry : Yes, I think we are still north of 150, but that\u2019s the right area. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And I guess just a follow-up lastly again on the margin and the ability to remix the balance sheet I mean I hear what you are saying about the OCI risk management. But isn\u2019t that what the held-to-maturity category is for? John Shrewsberry : Yes, we are a significant user of that category. There are liquidity limitations when you move a lot of assets into held-to-maturity. They are not as readily available in model terms, in regulatory terms as ready liquidity. So, you have to be cautious about how you do that. But we are a heavier user of that for that these days, for that very reason. Brian Kleinhanzl : But even if you took a 20% haircut on liquidity effect for the LCR and that doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s a huge number on the overall, given where LCR is. I mean it\u2019s north of 100%? John Shrewsberry : Right. We have begun to use held-to-maturity in a more significant way for the very reason that you are describing. But nonetheless, we have got \u2013 we have a lot of interest rate sensitivity in that portfolio. And that is \u2013 that\u2019s probably the chief driver of volatility around our capital levels. And we are cautious about it. And of course if you believe, like it was reasonable to believe during last quarter that a significantly more attractive entry point might be in the relatively near future than you would pause or slowdown anyway. And that\u2019s what we are wrestling with, especially now that rates have rallied back and it looks less likely that sort of the investable part of the curve that we are talking about is going to be substantially higher in the future. We have to have an opinion about that and then suffer the consequences once we have made our choices. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi, thank you for taking my question. So I guess, I will ask a bigger picture question that cuts across a lot of the numbers and the more specific questions and answers that have been made. You obviously, as any public company, have multiple stakeholders. You want to earn a fair return for your shareholders. You obviously want to meet your regulatory obligations. You want to be a good corporate citizen and do good for our society and country and whatnot. But I guess what I am getting at is how you think about balancing all those things in light of the sales fraud issues and the fallout from that and whether you think it is adversely impacting your ability to achieve positive operating leverage in terms of the magnitude and the timing of that in terms of pulling the cost lever maybe a little bit harder doing things like rationalizing branches. So I guess, I am just asking how your \u2013 how you think about it more from a big picture standpoint and whether you think it\u2019s \u2013 it is having an impact on the magnitude and the timing of when you can start to achieve positive operating leverage? Tim Sloan : Yes, it\u2019s a very good question. And the short answer is of course it\u2019s having an impact on the performance of the company. I mean I think that when you step back and you look at the \u2013 how serious the retail sales practice issues were and the reputational impact on the company, you can only reach that conclusion, right. Having said that, I also step back and appreciate that we have been in business for 165 years and we have had periods in our history where we have hit some rough patches. And I think what we have been able to demonstrate historically and that what our team has been able to demonstrate over the last few months, is we can work through those challenges and we will work through those challenges. But in the short-term, it\u2019s had an impact. It\u2019s had an impact in reference to Matt\u2019s question about the time that we are spending in various activities, but I think it\u2019s making us a better company. I have seen the management team of this company step up and accomplish things that I wouldn\u2019t have imagined. I think we have asked a lot more of ourselves. It\u2019s increased the pace at which change that we are making in the company. And all the while, right, we just had our 18th consecutive quarter of generating more than $5 billion of earnings. And we have achieved industry leading, where we are near the highs, ROA and ROE, right. And that\u2019s a reflection of the quality of the team that we have and that\u2019s the reflection of this diversified business model, which is incredibly valuable. So, it\u2019s a big picture question. That was a big picture answer. But there is no question in my mind that we are going to continue to improve from here. Saul Martinez : Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thank you for that. Tim Sloan : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Tim and John, couple of questions. Firstly, the board\u2019s report that came out which said that sales practices, the issues you are having were identified as a serious risk to the board from 2014. Any color on why that, if it was notified to the board at that point, 2014, why it wasn\u2019t disclosed in your public filing since then? Tim Sloan : Yes, Vivek, I would prefer on this call not to spend a lot of time dissecting the board\u2019s report. I think that the board\u2019s report was a very tough and comprehensive review of the issues over a long timeframe. It dealt with some very serious historical challenges. Having said that, hindsight is incredibly valuable when you look back at the reputational risk, reputational impact on the company and I think that based on the information that we had at the time, I think we made the appropriate decisions in terms of our disclosures. And I would \u2013 and I think that the report reinforced that. But again, knowing what we know now, would we have made different decisions, not necessarily in terms of disclosure, but in terms of actions that we took and changes we took? Absolutely. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Let me switch to my fundamental question. First, your charge-offs are up quite a bit, 45 basis points linked quarter. Auto is up also year-on-year. Any \u2013 John, Tim, any color on where you see that going, the outlook for those? John Shrewsberry : For those two specific portfolios? Vivek Juneja : Yes, because those have gone up quite a bit. So especially auto because of everything we are hearing in terms of used car values and all the press you have seen, I don\u2019t need to regurgitate that. Tim Sloan : Yes, so good questions. I think that you got to look at the performance of those portfolios in context of one, the size of those portfolios in terms of our entire loan portfolio, number one and number two, in terms of the credit quality of the rest of the portfolio, which is as good, if not the best that I can recall seeing in my career in terms of auto. And John did a good job of kind of walking through it. We saw and became concerned about where used car values and where competitive pressures were going back to the middle of last year. We have been very transparent about that. And we think that we have gotten ahead of any significant issues. And that\u2019s why you are seeing originations be down in the double-digits year-over-year. And that\u2019s not just something that happened this quarter. It\u2019s been the last few quarters. I don\u2019t know exactly where auto losses are going to go. They certainly could go a bit higher. But I think that the changes and the decision that we made over last 6 months has reinforced kind of the long-term view of how we manage credit at this company. In terms of credit card, I mean, John, jump in, I think some of that was seasonality, but I wouldn\u2019t get overly concerned about how that could impact our earnings. I don\u2019t know, John, if you feel...? John Shrewsberry : I don\u2019t think it will have an impact on our earnings, but it is an observation that consumer unsecured credit is probably the weak spot in our overall credit portfolios. They are a little bit worse than they were. We also have our own \u2013 we slowed down the growth of the size of the portfolios. So it was a little bit less of a new customer phenomenon, a little bit more of a seasoned customer phenomenon. So it was going to behave a little bit differently, if it\u2019s growing at a different pace than it used to. I think we have got some fanning of the performance of different cohorts of origination from year-to-year. I think at the margins, it\u2019s a little bit worse, not \u2013 it\u2019s not a big enough contributor to our performance overall where it\u2019s going to make a big difference. I think it\u2019s priced for the risk that we have, but the losses are a little bit worse. I think as we had historically been a \u2013 originated primarily through our branches, which is well understood. And we have been experimenting with other channels of origination and as we do that, I think there is an expectation that on average those other channels will perform a little bit worse than people who are already are deposit customers. We think we can price for that risk. We think that\u2019s how the industry works. It\u2019s a reasonable approach. But when comparing history with present, we should display some difference in performance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning guys. Tim Sloan : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us of your average non-interest bearing deposits about $364 billion, how much is that in the commercial area versus consumer and I think you mentioned on the call that you raised some deposit rates in the commercial area, could you share with us how many basis points you lifted them up in the quarter? John Shrewsberry : Well, so it\u2019s correct that our deposit pricing changed in commercial almost entirely versus consumer or small business. And so really, the full move in average deposit costs for the company is coming from commercial. So we will do some quick weighted average math here and describe it. It\u2019s roughly half of the deposits of the company. The impact on commercial was roughly double what the average was for the company as a whole. Tim Sloan : Yes. I think that\u2019s fair. And frankly, that isn\u2019t necessary a widely programmatic pricing change, but it\u2019s for different categories of customers based on relationship, based on value of the deposit, etcetera. So it\u2019s been somewhat sort of by appointment as we have navigated through these rate increases. Gerard Cassidy : And following-up on the value to the customer, the compensating balances, would you expect as rates go higher, that your customers, your commercial customers, will be able to lower compensating balances amounts to still be able to receive the products you provide to them? Tim Sloan : Yes, because we need to adjust our earnings credit rate, the ECR rate that we pay to those customers. So I think that\u2019s fair. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. John, you spent a lot of time about the OCI and the work you guys have done there, have you had any success in trying to figure out how much, based on what the Fed\u2019s balance sheet is today, $4.5 trillion and the talk of the unwinding that\u2019s coming down the road maybe the next 12 months, do you guys have any estimate of what you think the impact on the 10-year government bond yield is due to the daily buying that the Fed does to maintain that $4.5 trillion balance sheet? Tim Sloan : We were hoping you would tell us. John Shrewsberry : There are a variety of academic studies that we have processed, because as you are accurately pointing out, that is sort of a key risk in our OCI analysis, especially as the talk\u2019s been heating up about them being more explicit about a QE reversal. And I think as you weighted average or look through those studies and see what they mean \u2013 and of course, this is going to feel different on different days as the market reacts to the notion of selling. But in terms of that supply ending up having distributed back throughout the investing community, the market would suggest you are in sort of the 60 basis points range in terms of yield differential. I mean there is a lot of assumptions that are baked into that. But that would be a sort of a consensus of the academic work that\u2019s been done on the topic. Tim Sloan : And there is \u2013 all kidding aside, there is a difference I think between the impact on treasuries and also the impact on MBS at the same time, it\u2019s hard to say if all other things were equal, because when you think about the impact on MBS at the same time that, that could be happening, we would be having a restructuring in terms of Fannie and Freddie in the mortgage market. And so I think we have got to make sure that we are taking that into consideration. John Shrewsberry : There could be wild volatility on any given day or week. But once all is settled, that\u2019s the estimate of the full absorption of that overhang of supply. Tim Sloan : But I think if you, to John\u2019s point, I think if you assume kind of a high double-digit range, 60 basis points to 70 basis points to 80 basis points, that\u2019s as good as we can imagine right now. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just finally, you have talked about your efficiency ratio and obviously you are not pleased with where it is today, when we look at your non-interest expense and divide that by average assets, it\u2019s about \u2013 those stated numbers, it\u2019s about 2.86%, which is unchanged from a year ago, how much of the improvement in the efficiency ratio that you foresee will come from revenue being better than \u2013 and I know you are going to focus on expenses, but how much could come from better revenue? Tim Sloan : Well, that certainly could happen, but that\u2019s not where we are focused on in terms of improving the efficiency of the company. And I am glad you pointed that out. I mean that would be \u2013 I mean if revenues grew at 2x what we have talked about and the efficiency ratio very quickly would fall within our ranges. We are not going to declare victory because of that. We are going to focus on improving the efficiency of the company. We will measure it by the efficiency ratio. But we will certainly not take credit for the benefits that occur because revenues are up. We want to stay with the risk discipline that we have as an overlay to all of this. There is no question about that. But we want to improve the operating efficiency of the company. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on one of the broader themes of the Board report, which related to the compliance function and how it functioned and could you just give us a sense of what \u2013 you talked a lot of changes to the comp structure and such, but in terms of the centralized oversight of the retail function, can you give us a sense of where you are in that remediation? Tim Sloan : Sure and I am glad you asked that question. So one of the areas that the Board focused on was the historical structure of the company, which I would describe is very siloed [ph] in terms of each business having its own compliance function, credit function, finance function, HR function. And just think about all the enterprise activities, technology, all the enterprise activities that you would need to operate a business like that. And I think the report appropriately highlighted that that structure didn\u2019t allow for the appropriate escalation, the timely escalation of the underlying issues, number one. And number two, it didn\u2019t allow for as strong as of checking balance that we would have had hoped for. We fundamentally changed that. And what does that mean, that means that we have moved the folks that were in risk within the community banking business to our enterprise risk function. So they now report to our Chief Risk Officer, Mike Loughlin. We have moved to the human resources team that was in the community banking business and they now report up through our Chief Administrative Officer, Hope Hardison. And I could go on and on with each one of the activities. So we centralized our enterprise activities. That\u2019s going to create some efficiencies over time. But the primary reason we did that was so that we had the \u2013 a more appropriate escalation of risk and a more timely escalation of risk. And I can see that working now in the company today. And that\u2019s some of the hard work and effort that the team has been focused on over the last few months and that\u2019s completed. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. And you anticipated my follow-up a little bit, which is it would seem that the centralization should be ultimately a source of some efficiency, but I imagine there is also some investment going on in these functions, so kind of net-net, how should we think about just kind of the cost of compliance within retailer, perhaps at Wells more broadly? Tim Sloan : I think that you should imagine the cost of compliance being elevated right now. And the reason it\u2019s elevated right now is the things as you pointed out \u2013 or the reason \u2013 or you pointed out, there is a lot of change going on and we want to make sure we do it right. We have two consent orders that we need to comply with. And we have invited third-parties to look at our practices in our culture across the company. So I would say that they are elevated right now. And once we comply with the consent orders and we make sure that there are no other issues that we need to deal with then you can imagine those going down over time. But right now, the most important job of this company is rebuilding trust. We can\u2019t sacrifice short-term efficiency for doing that. Over the long-term, we are going to do that and that\u2019s what we will \u2013 we will talk about that efficiency more at Investor Day. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Tim Sloan : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research LLC. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Good morning, guys. Tim Sloan : Hey, Nancy. Nancy Bush : I want to get at Matt\u2019s question from sort of a different angle and this is what kind of pops into my head every time I start thinking about this. You said you are seeing progress in the retail bank, but you are not back to pre-settlement levels. And I guess I would have to ask, what makes you confident that you can get back to pre-settlement levels? Since a lot of the metrics we were seeing pre-settlement were bogus. So I guess, what is going to happen that sort of takes us back to this new path that\u2019s going to enable you to sort of get to a new plateau or the next level? Tim Sloan : Sure. So Nancy, I might just push back a little bit on the bogus comment, because that would indicate that our statements were materially inaccurate and they weren\u2019t, okay. Having said that, you make a really fair point and it\u2019s one that we\u2019re wrestling with. Because some of the metrics that we\u2019re seeing and that we\u2019ll talk about in Investor Day for example, would tell us that the average value of the new checking customer that we are bringing on is more valuable than maybe 1, 2 years ago or 3 years ago. And so we certainly could imagine an environment where, let\u2019s say, the rate of new primary checking growth in Community Banking may be lower than pre-settlement levels, but the value and therefore the revenue impact over time might be higher. And so we are working through all that right now, but I take your point. I didn\u2019t mean to suggest and I appreciate the correction that I didn\u2019t mean to suggest that we think we are going to get to exactly to those numbers. But clearly, primary checking account growth at less than 2% is below what our aspirations are. And we can do better than that over time delivering product, service and advice and products in the right way. Nancy Bush : Okay. And I have a question for John \u2013 a follow-up for John. Deposit rates in the retail bank are not up overall, but have you had to, in certain markets or certain customer subgroups, etcetera had to compete with deposit rates just to sort of overcome the sales fraud issues? John Shrewsberry : No, but in fact, we haven\u2019t. We have sort of stuck with our approach and the value proposition of being a retail customer of Wells Fargo with a whole bundle of capability, functionality, etcetera and the relationships that we have had. So, we haven\u2019t been competing in retail banking on price. Nancy Bush : Okay. And just Tim one final question for you, the board report and the news of the clawbacks, etcetera, etcetera, was all very dramatic. In your view, does that sort of represent \u2013 does this report and the events around it sort of represent the high watermark I guess of headline risk to the company? Did you get better from here I guess is what I\u2019m asking? Tim Sloan : You know, Nancy, the short answer is I hope so. But one of the things that I\u2019ve learned painfully, and I think we\u2019ve all learned painfully, over the last 6 months is that regardless of how well we perform or how dramatic the changes are, we don\u2019t control the headlines. I could wish we did. I wish that the media would cover the fact that we\u2019re one of the most generous, not the most generous firm and financial services. I wish the media would cover the fact that we\u2019ve now had our 18th consecutive quarter of earnings over $5 billion. I wish the media would highlight all the changes that we made in headlines in this company over the last 6 months, but the new business is different. It changes. They are under more pressure. I respect that. We respect it. So we are going to work very hard as we continue to rebuild trust and do everything we can to put the headline risk behind it. But I don\u2019t control it, and we don\u2019t. Nancy Bush : Okay, alright, fair answer. Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Kevin Barker : Thank you. You touched on this earlier about your cash balances and how that plays into your HQLA. Obviously, cash has gone up dramatically in this quarter. Could you talk about your targets or your long-term targets on where this cash balances could settle down over the long-term? I believe you said something around $200 billion back in the Investor Day last year? John Shrewsberry : Yes. Well, it depends on what the calculations are for outflows under LCR, because our combination of cash in HQLA, which for LCR purposes are indistinguishable is a function of those possible outflows under stress. So it\u2019s going to move around. It\u2019s probably in the $200 billion range. But the decision to whether to have a little more than that or a lot more than that plays back into this question of what you are going to do with the rest of it. Is there meaningful loan demand in that period? Is there an attractive entry point for adding to our investment portfolio that period? And how is that influenced by our OCI sensitivity at that point in time given where rates are and where they are likely to go on a probabilistic basis. All of those things fit together. But at least with the balance sheet structure the way that it currently is, our commitments or other sort of calls on liquidity the way they currently are, $200 billion is probably not too far off of a reasonable level. Kevin Barker : And when you net all those things out, do you expect that to continue to decline through 2017 or is this something longer term that you are considering? John Shrewsberry : Do I consider our total available cash to decline toward more of a minimum? Is that the question? Kevin Barker : Yes, that\u2019s right. John Shrewsberry : If we begin to get either a rate move up or more certainty that the bigger stimulus, which might cause a big rate move up, is it going to happen one way or another, my sense is that we\u2019re probably get more invested in the course of the year or of course, if there are big moves in loan growth beyond what we would reasonably imagine, which is the first call on all of our liquidity. Kevin Barker : Okay, thank you for taking my questions. John Shrewsberry : Yes, thank you. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Well, I want to thank all of you for your time this morning. I know it\u2019s been a very busy morning for all of you. I want to thank you for the depth and breadth of your questions. As we\u2019ve mentioned, our number one priority here is rebuilding trust in all of our shareholders. And clearly, you are all very important stakeholders for our company. And we are doing that with the overlay of making good, long-term decisions to provide the best long-term returns to our shareholders. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our team in terms of the progress that they have made over the last 6 months, in terms of how we are delivering on the vision to satisfy our customers\u2019 financial needs and help them to succeed financially. We look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day in about a month. So thank you and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining. And you may now all disconnect.",

Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Rowe, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Rowe, you may begin. Jim Rowe : Thank you, Regina, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn our call over to CEO and President, Tim Sloan. Timothy Sloan : Thank you, Jim. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. The benefit of our diversified business model once again resulted in strong financial performance. Our team members are committed to putting our customers first and helping them succeed financially, which is demonstrated each and every day all across our Company. Here are just a few examples. We continued to improve customer experience and loyalty scores in Retail Banking. Our debit card purchase and transaction volumes were industry leading. We had record client assets in Wealth and Investment Management, and we originate more ACH payments than any other financial institution. Let me briefly summarize our financial results in the second quarter. We generated earnings of $5.8 billion, up 5% from a year-ago and EPS of $1.07 a share, up 6%. We produced $22.2 billion of revenue with record net interest income, up 6% from a year-ago. Average earning assets grew 5% from a year-ago, average deposits were a record $1.3 trillion, up 5% from a year-ago. We had very strong credit results with the net charge-off rate declining to 27 basis points, the lowest level I\u2019ve seen during my nearly 30 years at Wells Fargo reflecting our consistent risk management. Our efficiency ratio was 61.1% in the second quarter. While it improved from the first quarter, the efficiency ratio is still too high, operating at this level is just not acceptable and we are firmly committed to the goals we provided at Investor Day. As John will discuss later on the call, we are making progress on our ongoing expense initiatives which target $2 billion of expense saves by the end of 2018 that will support our investment in the business and an additional $2 billion of expense saves by the end of 2019 that is expected to go to the bottom line. And while we are focused on reducing expenses and improving efficiency, we are continuing to invest in our businesses and in particular technologies that make it easier for our commercial and consumer customers to manage their finances. During the second quarter, we rolled out Zelle, a P2P payment platform for 28 million digital customers, provided enhancements for our Treasury Management customers to streamline and automate accounts receivable, launched a chatbot pilot for Facebook Messenger, began the rollout of new streamlined mobile checking account opening experiences for our customers, and launched a new service for commercial card customers that allows them to upload and manage receipts with their mobile device. At the end of the first quarter, we were the first large bank in the U.S. to offer card-free access to all of our ATMs and our customers are excited about this added convenience. As of last week, our customers had used the new card-free ATM access code over 1 million times. We are also focused on improving the operating performance of the Company by increasing our emphasis on core banking products and services that we believe are most relevant for our customers and provide the best financial returns for our shareholders. As part of this effort, last year we sold our crop insurance and health benefit services businesses and we recently announced the sale of our commercial insurance business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter and our shareowner service business, which is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Importantly, during the second quarter, we continued to make progress on rebuilding trust, which remains our top priority. Let me update you on a few actions and milestones. This week, we received preliminary court approval for the $142 million settlement agreement for a class action lawsuit concerning retail sales practices, including providing an avenue for customers whose credit was harmed to seek compensation. We expect the settlement to resolve substantially all claims in 10 other pending class actions. Over the past 10 months, we've been very comprehensive in our approach to customer outreach and remediation, and these efforts are ongoing. This preliminary approval, which covers the period beginning in May of 2002 through April of 2017, is a significant step forward in our efforts to make things right for our customers. Our team members completed a company-wide, third-party culture assessment in the second quarter, which provided them the opportunity to share feedback about Wells Fargo\u2019s culture. We are processing these results and the goal is to identify both positive attributes and potential weaknesses, so we can take actions that will strengthen our culture. We launched our new nationwide marketing campaign, building better every day, which builds on our commitment to creating a better bank for our customers, our team members, communities, and investors. We still have more work to do, including the completion of a third-party review of our sales practices in the Community Bank as part of meeting our consent order obligations as well as a voluntary review of accounts from 2009 and 2010 to determine possible unauthorized accounts and associated harm, which we expect to complete by the end of the third quarter. However, I'm pleased with the progress we've made, and I'm confident we're on the right path. Our recent CCAR results are just one indication of that. As part of our 2017 capital plan, we expect to return more capital to our shareholders, including increasing the third quarter common stock dividend to $0.39 per share, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. The plan also includes up to $11.5 billion of common stock repurchases on a gross basis during the four quarter period starting in the third quarter of this year. This is an increase from the $8.3 billion we repurchased during the four-quarter period ended June 30. Before I turn the call over to John to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to again highlight the efforts of our 271,000 team members who work hard each and every day to fulfill our vision of helping our customers to succeed financially, which results in such strong operating performance for our shareholders. John? John Shrewsberry : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As Tim mentioned, we earned $5.8 billion in the second quarter, the 19th consecutive quarter of generating earnings greater than $5 billion. We believe this outcome reflects the benefit of our diversified business model during a period of continued modest economic growth and uncertainty regarding future interest rates. Tim described most of the year-over-year results that we show on Page 3. So I'll just highlight the decline of 82 million common shares outstanding over the past year, reflecting our strong capital return through a net share repurchases. Turning to Page 4, let me highlight a few notable balance sheet trends. Driven primarily by the expected decline in auto loans, which were down $2.5 billion from the first quarter, total loans declined $982 million from the prior quarter. As we've discussed previously, we've tightened credit underwriting standards in auto, which was reduced our origination volume down 17% from the first quarter. Cash and short-term investments declined $43.5 billion, reflecting a seasonal decline in deposits and the pay-down of wholesale funding. However, we still maintain strong liquidity levels and could deploy tens of billions of dollars and remain LCR compliant. Investment securities increased $2 million in the quarter, we had approximately $37 billion of gross purchases in the quarter, the majority of which were agency MBS. These purchases were largely offset by run-off in the sale of approximately $15 billion of lower yielding short duration securities. The $17.6 billion decrease in long-term debt was primarily driven by the prepayment of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5, I'll describe revenue and expense trends later on the call. So let me just highlight that our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 27.7%. This included discrete tax benefits totaling $186 million or approximately $0.04 per share, primarily as a result of our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services. We currently expect our full-year 2017 effective income tax rate to be approximately 29%. As shown on Page 6, the benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 10 basis points in the quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of increasing loan yields. We had modest average loan growth from a year-ago, up 1% and average loans declined $6.7 billion from the first quarter. H.8 data continue to indicate that there was softness across the industry, but they're also specific actions we've taken, primarily driven by our own risk discipline, which have caused our growth to slow. Let me explain the primary factors impacting our loan portfolios in some more detail. Starting with commercial C&I loans increased $1.9 billion from the first quarter. We had growth across a number of businesses, including $1.1 billion in Government and Institutional Banking, $605 million in Wells Fargo Commercial Capital, $469 million in Global Banking and modest growth in the middle market. The growth was partially offset by $620 million decline in financial institutions from actions we've taken to lower exposure in certain emerging markets and decreased demand. Capital markets activity has resulted in pay-downs in Corporate Banking. It's interesting to note that Wells Fargo Securities was involved in some capacity in all of the capital markets activity associated with the pay-downs of these loans in Corporate Banking, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model. The size of our oil and gas portfolio stabilized and we had $12.7 billion outstanding at the end of the second quarter. Commercial real estate loans declined $982 million from the first quarter and while we remain the largest CRE lender in the country, our growth has been modestly below that of the industry for the first half of this year. We've remained disciplined and in hearing to our underwriting standards in a competitive market. We summarize our consumer loan portfolios on Page 8. This portfolio declined $11.1 billion from a year-ago, primarily due to $7 billion of lower junior lien mortgage loans at $4 billion of lower auto loans. Let me explain the $1.9 billion linked quarter decline in consumer loan portfolio in some more detail. Our first mortgage loans increased $1.9 billion from the first quarter, reflecting $7.3 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the continued run-off of higher yielding legacy portfolios, including the sale of $569 million Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio. Our junior lien mortgage loan portfolio continued to decline as expected as pay-downs more than offset new originations. Our credit card portfolio increased $563 million from the first quarter reflecting seasonality. Our auto portfolio continued to decline as expected and was down $2.5 billion from the first quarter. As a result of tightening underwriting standards, the quality of originations has improved with the quarterly average FICO of 719 at origination in the second quarter, up from 696 a year-ago. As we highlighted at Investor Day, we're also making a number of organizational changes in this business including a new leader. As we focus on improving execution and efficiency through increased standardization and centralization. We expect auto loans to continue to decline in the second half of this year. Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $339 million reflecting seasonality in our student loan portfolio and $190 million decline in personal loans and lines. While consumer loan growth will continue to be impacted by the actions we're taking in our auto portfolio and the expected run-off of legacy junior lien mortgage loans, we are making some modest changes to generate new loan originations, including offering interest-only jumbo mortgage loans to high quality borrowers and testing credit card offerings through our digital channels. As highlighted on Page 9, the average deposits were a record $1.3 trillion, up $64.5 billion or 5% from a year-ago and up $2 billion from the first quarter. Our deposit betas remain low with our average deposit cost up four basis points from the first quarter. While we've implemented some incremental commercial deposit repricing in line with the market was not made material changes in rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits as we've seen very little market response in these categories. With the majority of our peers holding rates steady. We continue to monitor the overall market and we expect deposit betas will be more responsive as we move further into the rate cycle. Net interest income was a record $12.5 billion in the second quarter, up 6% from a year-ago and 1% from the first quarter. The increase from the first quarter reflected the benefit of the repricing of earning assets due to higher short-term interest rates, which exceeded the associated cost of repricing liabilities. We also benefited from one additional day in the quarter. The net interest margin increased 3 basis points to 2.9% driven by higher short-term interest rates, disciplined deposit pricing and a reduction in long-term debt, which were partially offset by the impacts from lower loan and investment securities balances. As we've previously stated, we expect NII to grow in the low to mid single digits for the full-year 2017. The rate of growth during the second half of the year will be dependent on a variety of factors including the level and slope of the yield curve as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends. Non-interest income declined $743 million from a year-ago, driven by lower market sensitive and mortgage banking revenue, while non-interest income was down only $16 million from the first quarter. There are few business drivers, I want to highlight. Deposit service charges were down $37 million from the first quarter, reflecting a higher earnings credit rate for commercial customers and lower consumer and business checking service charges. Over the past few months, we've made a number of changes to help our customers avoid unexpected overdrafts including the introduction of a zero balance email alert that sent intraday when a customer\u2019s available balance is zero or negative, which our online banking customers receive automatically. Card fees were a record $1 billion, up $74 million from the first quarter, reflecting a 7% increase in debit card transaction volume and the 12% increase in credit card purchase volume. Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $80 million from the first quarter, residential mortgage origination volume increased $12 billion or 27% from the first quarter on higher purchase volume, reflecting seasonality and a strong purchase market. However, originations were down 11% from a year-ago, reflecting lower refi volume. According to NBA data, the industry is projected to decline 15% for full-year 2017 from the slowdown in refinancing. Applications were up 41% from the first quarter and we ended the second quarter with a $34 billion unclosed pipeline. The production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage originations was 124 basis points in the second quarter, down from 168 basis points in the first quarter. Approximately two-thirds of the decline was due to competitive pricing in both the retail and correspondent channels, while the rest of the decline was driven by a mix shift to a higher percentage of correspondent channel originations, which have a significantly lower margin than retail originations. 55% of our originations in the second quarter were correspondent, up from 50% in the first quarter and 44% a year-ago. While it's still very early in the quarter, we currently expect similar industry pricing and mix trends. Finally, our other income increased $249 million from the first quarter and included a $309 million gain on the sale of a Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio. On Page 12, we provide details on trading related revenue and the impact to net interest income and non-interest income. Trading-related revenue was down $151 million or 15% from the first quarter. Trading-related net interest income increased $51 million. However, non-interest income declined $202 million from the first quarter on lower net gains from trading activities. $81 million of the decline was from lower deferred compensation plan investment results, which was largely offset in employee benefits expense. The decline also reflected lower market making trading results losses from RMBS and equity-related activity, which was offset in interest income and lower CVA and DVA. As shown on Page 13, expenses declined to $251 million from the first quarter, primarily driven by the seasonal decline in compensation related expense. As Tim mentioned earlier, while our efficiency ratio improved to 61.1% in the second quarter, it's still too high. We currently expect our efficiency ratio to improve in the second half of the year and expect our full-year efficiency ratio to be 60% to 61% in 2017. This estimate does not include any potential non-recurring expenses including reasonably possible, but not yet accrued litigation expenses. At Investor Day, we helped \u2013 to help analyze our expenses; we divided our non-interest expense line items into six main expense categories. We've used these same categories to describe the expense drivers on a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis starting on Page 15. The 2% decline in expenses from the first quarter was driven by $570 million decline in compensation and benefits expense from seasonally lower, personnel expenses and lower deferred comp expense. We also had $52 million reduction in infrastructure expense on lower equipment expense from typically high first quarter software licensing and maintenance costs. Partially offsetting these declines was $266 million of higher thirty-party services expense. This increase reflected higher spending primarily related to Technology, Consent Orders, Resolution, Recovery Planning and Legal Expenses. We currently expect these costs to remain at an elevated level in the third quarter before declining in the fourth quarter. We also had higher non-discretionary running the business expenses. This increase was primarily from $68 million of higher operating losses in the second quarter driven by higher litigation accruals. As we usually do, we will include in our 10-Q filing an update on the high-end of the range of reasonably possible \u2013 potential litigation losses in excess of our accrued liability for the quarter. But based on the information currently available, which may change between now and when we file the 10-Q, we expect the high end of the range to increase by approximately $1.3 billion due to a variety of matters, including our existing RMBS related regulatory investigations. On Page 16, we show the drivers of the year-over-year increases in expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $339 million, driven by higher salaries from annual salary increases and a 1% increase in FTE. Thirty-party services expense also increased $339 million approximately $110 million of this increase was sales practice related. Non-discretionary running the business expense increased $185 million, which included $94 million donation to the Wells Fargo Foundation and $73 million amount of higher FDIC expense due to the special assessment implemented last July. Partially offsetting these increases were $152 million of lower revenue related expenses primarily from lower commissions and other incentives in Mortgage and Wholesale Banking. Discretionary running the business expense declined $60 million on lower travel and entertainment, postage, and advertising expense. We continue to make progress on efficiency initiatives that we expect will reduce expenses by approximately $2 billion annually by year-end 2018 with the full-year benefit starting in 2019. As we've previously mentioned these savings will be reinvested in the business, however, there are timing differences to consider. We've significantly increased our business investments in the last few years, and while we've made a lot of progress on the work that needs to be done on these initiatives. Most of the expenses savings are in the earlier stages are being realized. As we show on Page 17, the largest opportunity relates to centralization and optimization, we list the lot of great examples of the efforts we're making, which we expect will save $1.3 billion annually. Let me highlight just a few. Approximately 113,000 team members across the Company have been realigned over the past 18 months as part of our centralization and optimization initiative. Operating cost in human resources have already been reduced by 12% since the beginning of 2016 and we reduced the number of marketing agency vendors resulting in 12% reduction in quarterly agency fees from a year-ago also. On Slide 18, we highlight the other areas of the $2 billion expense initiative, through aggregating demand and staffing to create certain capabilities in-house we expect to save approximately $200 million related to third-party services expense. During the first six months of this year, we\u2019ve closed 93 branches, including 54 in the second quarter and we're on track to close 200 branches this year. As we disclosed at Investor Day, we plan to close in additional 250 branches next year. As a reminder, there are minimal immediate savings recognized from branch closures due to the initial closing costs. So therefore most of the expense benefit from the 200 branches we close this year will not be realized until next year. We also expect to save approximately $150 million and infrastructure expense through continued site consolidation outside of our branch network and we're on track to reduce two million square feet this year. We expect to save another $200 million through other initiatives, including reduced to travel expenses. As we discussed at Investor Day, we expect an additional $2 billion in annual expenses saves by the end of 2019 these savings are projected to go to the bottom line. Turning to our Business segments starting on Page 19, Community Banking earned $3 billion in the second quarter, down 6% from a year-ago and down 1% from the first quarter. Our branch network is now below 6,000 for the first time since our merger with Wachovia at the end of 2008. As we discussed at Investor Day, we're making a shift in how we report activity to highlight metrics we believe best show how we're managing the business today and our most important to our long-term success. As we show on Slide 20, existing customers continue to actively use their accounts, branch and ATM interactions were up 3% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality and we're down 3% from a year-ago. The decline from a year-ago was primarily driven by customers migrating to our digital channels with digital secure sessions up 5% from a year-ago. Our 27.9 million digital active customers are increasingly using our award winning online and mobile capabilities. For the first time in May, we had more mobile active customers than online active customers and we continue to invest in our mobile capabilities, including as Tim highlighted at the top, the ability to open accounts through mobile. Primary consumer checking customers increased from a year-ago, although the rate of growth has continued to slow active consumer general purpose credit card accounts were up 2% from both the first quarter from a year-ago. On Slide 21, we highlight balance and activity growth, which drives revenue. Average consumer and small business banking deposits grew by 5% from a year-ago. Debit card purchase volume increased 6% and the average consumer general purpose credit card balances increased 7% from a year-ago. Our team members continue to focus on what we know is most important providing outstanding customer service. This effort has resulted in the overall satisfaction with most recent visit and customer loyalty scores in June reaching their highest levels since August of 2016 and overall satisfaction scores were higher than a year-ago. The Community Banking team continues to work on making changes that will further improve the customer and team member experience. We're investing in training leaders throughout the country during coaching events that started last month. During the second quarter, we had our first payout under the new compensation plan for Community Banking team members with a 90% participation rate. More changes to the way we do business will be rolled out during the third quarter to further support our priorities through simplification, collaboration and innovation. Wholesale Banking earned $2.4 billion in the second quarter, up 15% from a year-ago and up 13% from the first quarter. These results included a tax benefit resulting from our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services. It's also important to note that prior year results included the $290 million gain on the sale of our health benefit services business. Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $682 million in the second quarter, up 17% from a year-ago and up 9% from the first quarter. WIM had positive operating leverage on both year-over-year and linked-quarter basis, revenue increased 7% from a year-ago with a 21% increase in net interest income and a 2% growth in non-interest income. Average loans grew 7% and average deposits increased 3%. Deposit growth was impacted by seasonal tax related outflows, as well as brokerage clients moving more of their cash balances into other investments. We highlighted last quarter then in March; we had our first $1 billion month of closed referred investment assets from the partnership between Wealth and Investment Management and Community Banking since the sales practices settlement. Twice during the second quarter, we achieved $1 billion of monthly closed referred investment assets, a result of effective partnering between our bankers and financial advisors. WIM total client assets were a record $1.8 trillion, up 8% from a year-ago, driven by continued positive net flows and higher market valuations. Turning to Page 24, net charge-offs decreased $150 million from the first quarter with 27 basis points of annualized net charge-offs, which are at historically low levels. Commercial losses declined $68 million from the first quarter, driven by continued improvement in our oil and gas portfolio, where losses declined $81 million linked-quarter. Consumer losses declined $82 million with lower losses in auto, consumer real estate and other revolving credit and installment portfolios. Our consumer real estate portfolios both first and second lien mortgages were actually in a net recovery position in the second quarter, demonstrating the significant improvement in the residential real estate market and the quality of loans we put on our balance sheet. Non-performing assets continued to decline, down $827 million from the first quarter with improvements across all commercial portfolios and consumer real estate portfolios as well as lower foreclosed assets. We had a reserve release of $100 million, reflecting continued strong credit performance. Turning to Page 25, our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in increased to 11.6% in the second quarter and we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. Our net payout ratio was 63%. As Tim mentioned as part of our 2017 capital plan, we expect to return more capital to shareholders over the next four quarters, including up to $11.5 billion of gross common stock repurchases. Based on our updated TLAC estimate as of the end of the second quarter, we've exceeded our expected minimum requirement of 22% largely from lower RWAs and continued debt issuance. However, we continue to issue eligible TLAC to fund maturities, fund RWA growth and the expected migration of our CET1 level to our internal target level over time. In summary, our results in the second quarter, which included 1.21% return on assets and 11.95% return on equity and 14.26% return on tangible common equity demonstrated the benefit of our diversified business model which is generated, as I said earlier over $5 billion in quarterly earnings every quarter since the fourth quarter of 2012. We shared updates throughout the call today on progress we've made toward our goal of being the financial services leader in six areas; customer service and advice, team member engagement, innovation, risk management, corporate citizenship, and long-term shareholder value. I'm optimistic that the progress we are making will continue to drive our long-term success. And I think we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. John Shrewsberry : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I wanted to just kick-off on loan growth because while it was decent number relative to what we're seeing in the industry, the H8 was a little slower than what we're looking forward. So could you just give us a sense as to how you think that's going to be trajecting on a core level? And then was there anything on a non-core roll-off that was impacting the number? Timothy Sloan : Well, I think \u2013 Betsy that's one of the reasons why we wanted to provide some additional granularity in the slides in terms of where we're seeing loan growth. I think the loan growth trends continue to be good with the headwind that we're having just in terms of the absolute number being the run-off of the junior lien mortgage portfolio and then the impact from auto. But you saw in the first quarter or in the second quarter that we had some good growth in the C&I book, in Government and Institutional Banking, in Commercial Capital and Global Banking. Within the C&I book while real estate \u2013 commercial real estate construction activity was up, the more typical commercial real estate loans were down a little bit, primarily due to some of the competitive pressures that we're seeing out there. But I think our trends should continue and that is \u2013 our goal is to grow above the industry average. I think the important thing here and one of the reasons why we wanted to be really transparent is that we've got to do this. And one of the reasons why we've become the largest lender in the country is because of our consistent approach to how we manage risk. And we've seen cycles before; we'll see them again, but we will continue to be optimistic because loans are such an important product for our customers. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just separately to follow-up Tim on the decision to sell the insurance brokerage and then there was a small separate sale of a business, I think it was the shareholder services business that hit the tape the other day. I just wonder if you could give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the businesses that you want to retain, attract, invest in versus the ones that you are deciding to move away from because frankly, in conversations with investors, the insurance -- that was a bit of a surprise to people, thought was that it was good for CCAR and ROE, albeit had a higher expense ratio. So with that as a backdrop, maybe if you can give us your sense as to what we should be expecting from the team going forward? Timothy Sloan : Well, I think what you should expect from our team is continued strong performance, which is what we've delivered this quarter. I think in terms of businesses to that we've decided to sell, we\u2019re continuing to look at all of our businesses. We have high expectations in terms of financial performance, and for those businesses that one, we don't believe are as core for the platform, but two, maybe can grow better in the hands of others, we\u2019ve decided to exit those. I think the crop insurance business is a great example of that. It was actually bought by one of our customers and my understanding is they\u2019re doing well, which is great. We\u2019re happy about that. Likewise, the health benefit services business, which was a good business for us. The challenge there candidly was that the regulatory environment for that business got much more in terms of \u2013 became much more focused on medical regulations and we just thought that that was going to be a better chance to grow in the hands of somebody that's in that business full time; and again, we sold that to one of our customers. That's gone pretty well. And then likewise, on the insurance business, recall a couple \u2013 or three years ago, we sold the non-footprint offices in our commercial insurance brokerage business because there just wasn't much connection there with our existing business and as we looked at the insurance business, again it was performing fine, but candidly I think that that it might \u2013 we thought it might work better with others and we're very pleased with the buyer USI. They were the same firm that purchase the offices that we sold in 2014 and then again with shareowner services. So we're going to continue to look at all of our businesses. Those were all good businesses. I think other thing that is important is that all those buyers took care of our team. So we're trying to improve our results to all of you, and we're going to continue to look hard at our businesses and if something doesn't fit, then we'll move on. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Hey Matt. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. So a lot of good details on the expenses, the drivers of \u2013 with the $2 billion net will come from I think it's all very helpful and at the back half of the year commentary I think it\u2019s positive. But are you able to give some visibility on where you think the absolute level of cost can be looking on a couple of years? Timothy Sloan : Well, for the reasons we've talked about before, it's tough to give an absolute number, because so much of our expense is driven by the business results that are happening in any given quarter because they are related to production levels, et cetera. So instead what we are focused on is what we're taking out and focus importantly on our 55% to 59% efficiency ratio because we're driving our businesses to outperform and incidentally that is part of the story that you mentioned in your question. But the things we're focusing on our lower efficiency ratio businesses and the things that probably don't fit as well as some of our higher efficiency ratio businesses not all. So I would think of it that way. What costs are we taking out because there is non-value added, and we're improving the Company and where we signaling that we're going to run the Company over time, 55% to 59% as opposed to a specific dollar, which reflects more assumptions and it's reasonable to make about what our business mix is at that time what our production levels are at that time. Matt O'Connor: Yes, I can appreciate, some moving pieces in the revenue side, I do think even a range might be helpful. Some of your competitors, Bank of America and JPMorgan, one would argue they've got more volatile revenue stream and you because of a bigger investment bank and JPMorgan gives us an annual expense target, Bank of America is a number out there, couple years out. So I think it's something we're considering. I think would be helpful for your stock, obviously the expense message overall is positive and I do think it's something that might be helpful? Timothy Sloan : Thank you. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, following up on Matt's question on the expenses. John, can we go over that concept of the timing differences between the first $2 billion of expense saves that you're targeting for the end of 2018 and kind of the offsetting spending some of which is already occurring. Could you just explain that timing difference again? So we understand it. John Shrewsberry : Sure. So the first $2 billion should be fully in the run rate at the end of 2018, and the second $2 billion should be fully in the run rate at the end of 2019. The concept of the timing difference is, we have elevated expense today and we described some of the areas where that's occurring, some of that will abate naturally because programs run-off between now and the end of 2018 or at the end of 2019. So there isn't a nice stair-step that describes what rolls on and what rolls off. But we have higher expenses and this should be today in certain areas, and we've got these programs kicking in when we're describing them kicking in. Now it's certainly possible that \u2013 it's very likely actually that will begin to drip into the run rate, the first $2 billion before the end of 2018 and the second $2 billion before the end of 2019 that the last dollar of it should be in the run rate by the end of 2018 and the end of 2019. And then the complicated, I know you know this, but we've got a few other items that will be rolling off after 2018, FDIC insurance that sort of super premium there and some amortization of deposit intangibles that\u2019s out there. We are also selling these businesses, which will have an impact on expenses. All of those things will be happening at about the same time, but we'll keep driving people back towards evidence of the $2 billion for 2018 and the $2 billion of 2019, so you can see where we're taking that cost out. John McDonald : And because of that difference between the spending that you're doing to offset the first $2 billion and when you get the sales by next year, won't effectively some of that first $2 billion really be falling to the bottom line again 2018 because if the spending already happened, but now you are getting the savings? John Shrewsberry : Some of it will. That's because it's coming in before the last day of 2018 and there will be some ramp down in certain of the programs that we've got that have elevated expense today. But just for clarity sake to help people to understand how long it might take, we're describing it as the end of 2018 and the end of 2019. John McDonald : And then to the question of longer term targets, understanding the challenge of an absolute dollar target, but maybe a target that's the gap between your revenue growth and expense growth over time? Is that something that you might aspire to having a gap between those two and operating leverage kind of target? John Shrewsberry : We certainly aspire to have consistent positive operating leverage. It depends on what's going on with the rates, well all that's happening because the business mix will make a big difference and what kind of leverage we get with so much leverage in a higher rate environment if there isn\u2019t a lower rate environment, because you get extra revenue without actually having to put more labor into it. So there are assumptions that are embedded and what that would look like, but just to be perfectly clear in every business, in every way we're targeting to end up in a consistent positive operating leverage environment as a result of the moves that we're making. John McDonald : Okay, that's fair. One quick follow-up. Is there any change in your loan growth outlook for the full-year? I think in Investor Day, you're kind of targeting low single-digit loan growth for the year in terms of low single-digits, any change there after the results this quarter? John Shrewsberry : I think we're still looking at that same target. John McDonald : For the year? Okay. John Shrewsberry : Yes, for the year. John McDonald : Okay, thanks. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Hey Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey thanks. Thanks a lot. Good morning, guys. One more specific on just the expense trajectory. Can you help us understand on the insurance brokerage side and the sales of those businesses, is there any way to help us understand the magnitude of the revenue and expense related to those that go away. And are those expenses, specifically in the $2 billion? Timothy Sloan : So two things, one because we're still in the process of closing on those transactions, it\u2019s not appropriate to talk too much about the results of the businesses, we will wait until that's done. But two things, one is both the businesses that have been announced and are being closed this year have very high efficiency ratios. So you would expect to see the efficiency ratio benefit at the margin. These aren't huge businesses, but at the margin from the outcome and we'll talk more about what they meant to Wells Fargo after they close. But no, they're not in the $2 billion. So specifically the list of things that we're doing to improve Wells Fargo isn't getting benefited by expenses going away from having sold the business. Ken Usdin : That\u2019s great. Thanks for that. Second thing, just on \u2013 as the loan mix \u2013 well as the earning asset mix is changed with slower loan growth and mixing a little bit more into securities and cash. Can you just help us through the dynamic of just net interest income and NIM trajectory from here? Thanks. Timothy Sloan : Yes, well, so there's a lot that's going to happen with NIM trajectory and I'd say the biggest drivers to look for \u2013 part of it is earning asset mix and the rate of growth in loans and of course what kind of loans we put on the books. But at least in the short to medium-term probably more impactful is what's going on with deposit pricing, because we have been outperforming the beta that we showed to you at our Investor Day by a reasonable amount, especially on the consumer and small business side of things. And so as we sit around and think about the next six to 12 months and what happens with rates and what happens with net interest income whether or not we continue to outperform our modeled expectations on deposit repricing is really one of the big drivers, obviously deposit growth, loan growth, deployment into securities all matter, but I would focus on deposit pricing in the near-term. Ken Usdin : But you feel confident that NII can continue to grow from here? John Shrewsberry : We do. In fact, I think I mentioned sort of confirming that low-to-mid single digits NII \u2013 annual NII growth 2017 versus\u2026 Ken Usdin : Okay, understood. Thanks John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : I wanted to focus my line of questioning in terms of the revenue progress that\u2019s underlying your goal to get back to your efficiency range and maybe it's good to just jump off from Ken\u2019s line of questioning, you mentioned the betas are going to be a big swing factor, and I'm wondering how you're thinking about the sensitivity of outflow in beta as the Fed begins to reduce their balance sheet and how it would impact you specifically? John Shrewsberry : Sure. I mean I think our general assessment is if they start selling long duration assets, I know that there are people who believe that depositors will rush out of bank deposits and rush into mortgages in 10 years. I\u2019m less confident that that is an expected behavior, but let's assume that deposits decreased by some percentage of the amount of shrinkage in the balance sheet. I don\u2019t think we have any reason to believe that our impact on that would be any greater than our percentage of deposits overall, because we think that we're very competitive in our deposit franchises. We certainly are on product; service et cetera and we could be as competitive in prices as we choose to be depending on what the impact is on our business at that time. So the way we're thinking about it is we'll all wait and see what the impact \u2013 what happens to deposits in the aggregate. And then we'll react from a defensive position to the extent necessary to protect our deposit franchise as when and if the market begins to make moves in order to stem whatever tide of outflows there are at deposit side of the system. Timothy Sloan : Erika, just to reinforce John\u2019s point, I think that's why it\u2019s really important from our perspective to make sure that we're investing in our products and services convenience as John mentioned for our consumer customers that is \u2013 that when you are in an environment where it is uncertain, I mean the Fed has never had a balance sheet of this size. We've never been through a situation where they're talking about reducing a balance sheet. We can talk about history all day long, but since we've never been through that, nobody knows exactly what's going to happen. But what we do know is one thing and that is our customers\u2019 value convenience, service, reliability. And to the extent that we can continue to invest in all of our products and services we can compete on much more than just price. And as John said, we're comfortable about our ability in any environment of maintaining and hopefully growing our deposits here. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Moving on just to the other side of the balance sheet, one of your competitors gave a dollar number in terms of how much liquidity had been tied up with their Living Will process. And I'm wondering, especially given the treasury proposal, if you could share at least ballpark, how much liquidity is tied up there and just I guess wondering what the opportunity set for Wells Fargo could be, if reform does come to task given it seems like liquidity versus capital, it seems much more of the constraint? John Shrewsberry : Yes. There are big liquidity requirements as a result of resolution planning, but frankly, I don't think they get us to much different of a number than our LCR process. In fact LCR might actually take us to the requirements, plus our buffer we take us to a higher level than our resolution liquidity needs in our plan. So yes, there's a lot of liquidity on the books of the biggest banks. But it's for both of those reasons, and so if \u2013 in some way resolution planning was softened somehow. Frankly, I don't think for us, it would make that big of a difference, and I\u2019ll leave with that. Erika Najarian : And the final question just on the fee side, if you take out the gain on the PCI loans, the run rate is something like $9.4 billion and as we're looking forward to efficiency improvement for the second half of the year from the 61%. I'm wondering how we should think about the progression of fees in the second half. John Shrewsberry : Yes, well, I mean I go line by line. Probably the biggest swing item of course will be mortgage and what happens because now there is more price competition I think reflecting excess capacity and reflecting the different market that we're in. It's a little bit more of a free for all in the purchase market than it is in a refi market because of the way people source their mortgage loans and one versus the other. Then I\u2019ll just go back to their service or they go out to the market in a purchase environment. So I think mortgage banking could be a little bit more volatile. I think volumes are good and our leading shares certainly help and our introduction of technology, there will be an incremental help, but that's a reasonable swing item. I think everything else right now is in line with our five-quarter averages. We had a record in card fees for the quarter. Trust and investment fees are very high with the WIM results and that reflects inflows, as well as the levels of asset prices that drive a lot of the outcomes there. Service charges are good. They did tick down a little bit. We have introduced these new capabilities for our customers to avoid overdraft expenses. So that\u2019s \u2013 it would be a shame to lose that revenue, but it's good for our customers and we're happy to have done that. That feels like the right thing to do. And then insurance is likely to be in the run rate for the rest of the year. We probably won't close that until the end of the year. And then some of the market sensitive other items will reflect the markets that we're in. So there is the story behind each of them. Most of them are in line with the five-quarter averages and I'd say mortgage is probably the item to look at in terms of what's the size of the market, what the composition of the market and what's going on with margins that reflects competition. Erika Najarian : Okay. Thanks for taking my question. Timothy Sloan : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Hello Saul. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. Couple questions, first on the auto portfolio, it down $2.5 billion linked-quarter. Obviously you talked about tighter underwriting standards. But how should we think about that going forward in terms of the magnitude of declines in the second half and where we're ultimately in the size of the portfolio get to? Do you have a sense for that? Timothy Sloan : Yes, Saul, a good question. I think that you're likely to see a continued decline in the auto portfolio through the second half of this year and my bet is it will probably stabilize sometime in the first half of next year. I think during that entire time, it's reasonable to assume that\u2019s the quality of the underlying customer, which is really key here, but the quality underlying customers measured by FICO score will continue to improve, I don\u2019t know if it will continue to improve at the levels we've seen, but it will continue to be very strong. And then my guess is, that's where the business kind of stabilized sometime in the first half of next year. Saul Martinez : Okay. In the decline is really related more to pricing and not getting targeted returns than anything you're seeing from a credit standpoint, is that fair to say? Timothy Sloan : No, no I think a year-ago, we look at the market and what we saw in the market was the following. And that was that \u2013 remember that majority of our originations are for our used car loans. And so we saw \u2013 we would became concerned about underlying values of the collateral because of production levels by the industry. The number of cars that were coming off leases, we got concerned by the risk return in terms of pricing as well as term and we took that all into consideration in terms of ramping down our originations in improving the underlying quality. And on the short-term we gave up loan growth and so the metrics are not as good. We gave maybe some short-term revenue. But over the long-term, this is how we think about credit. We're not targeting certain balance levels or anything like that, but we want to continue to underwrite in an appropriate way on a product-by-product basis. Timothy Sloan : In that business, we're also reorganizing the business itself. We\u2019re collapsing lots of regional offices. More than 50 regional offices down into a number of much bigger centers and while that's going on, we\u2019ve reduced the risk profile of the portfolio and what\u2019s rolling into it. So that we can work through that reorganization with less inherent risk in the loan book and that's helpful. That\u2019s \u2013 maybe [that\u2019s in credit] to Wells Fargo when you're thinking about what this means for your auto loans in general. Saul Martinez : Got it. Just adding to that, on the retail sales metrics, it seems like you kind of embedded them into the segment results or some of them into the segment results. But it seems like some of the forward-looking indicators, whether it's I guess branch banker interactions, credit card applications, don't seem to be there. And I'm just curious what the logic was there and is the trend that you have been showing which was a big step function down after the sales fraud issue and then kind of a stabilization, is that sort of what we're continuing to see in some of those forward-looking indicators? Timothy Sloan : Yes. Let me start and John jump in. I think that what we're trying to do is provide you with a reflection of how we\u2019re measuring and running the business. So we changed for example, the incentive compensation plan in the first quarter. We talked about the results of that briefly. I think that we're seeing actually some very good results in terms of customer experience and a continued improvement in customer loyalty. I think the branch interactions are as reflective of what's going on in terms of customer choice moving more to mobile than anything else. And so when you think about our customer interactions what I would do is step back and not only look at branch interactions, but also look at the number of online and mobile interactions. We had a total of 1.9 billion interact customer interactions in the second quarter. And that's why it's important for example to make sure that we're investing in technologies. So a customer can open account on their mobile device set. And if they want to or they can come into one of our branches, that\u2019s fine. But overall, I would say that we're seeing a slow, but steady return in an improvement in underlying retail business. We still have more work to do, that\u2019s absolutely the case. Mary Mack and her team are absolutely focused on that, but we're making some progress. John Shrewsberry : As we announced at Investor Day, we\u2019re changing our descriptions, our disclosures to as Tim said to emphasize what Mary thinks is important in running the business. And you can see the branch and ATM transactions and the digital transactions in the supplement, they are on Slide 20. And just specifically to your question in terms of us having a stabilization point based on some of the previous monthly disclosures, there\u2019s nothing is changed about that, things are still stable, things are going well, we're opening more than we're closing et cetera. So this just represents the pivot toward how Mary is managing the business. Saul Martinez : Got it. Very clear. Thank you very much. Timothy Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Hey John. John Shrewsberry : Hey John. John Pancari : Good morning. On the deposit side, the weakness in the deposit fees, I know you've flagged a few items, you flagged the new products introduced and you also mentioned the higher earnings credit rate. Can you give us any idea of how much those factors for each was a drag, so in other words can you just slice it up how much was attributable to the new products versus the ECR and then possibly the sales practice issue? Timothy Sloan : I would say it\u2019s 50/50 between earnings credit rate and the changes that we made on overdraft. I don't \u2013 I\u2019m not specifically attributing anything to what was going on in sales practices in particular. John Pancari : Okay, all right. And then also on the deposit side, the decline in the deposit balances itself. Can you give us similar color around the drivers there, how much of that is at all tied to sales practice if at all or is just other factors that are impacting the\u2026 Timothy Sloan : Yes, I wouldn't attribute any of the decline in sales practices, I think again the second quarter tends to have a lot of seasonality in it particularly on the consumer and the wealth side because folks get their tax refunds and then they use them. And the tax refunds were delayed a bit this year and so I think there were probably three weeks to a month delayed and we talked about that in the first quarter. So actually I think that the deposit franchise on the consumer side and the wealth side performed better than what we had expected and better than last year. John Shrewsberry : So couple other items and we mentioned them earlier, but in WIM we had more customers shifting from cash into investments, so people actually moving out of cash and getting invested, so those would show up in assets under management on the WIM side. We also on any given quarter end we will have big dates for payroll, we\u2019ll have big dates for escrow payments, we\u2019ll have big dates for M&A, et cetera. And so just depending on what day of the week or what deals outstanding and what part of the cycle that occurs and those could be multi-billion dollar swing items at any point in time. So as a result, we tend to look at averages more often, and in Q2 we had a record average in deposit, so that reflects the whole business. John Pancari : Yes. All right. That was the color I was looking for. And then separately on the commercial real estate side, on the lending side, I know you indicated that you're adopting a bit more of a conservative credit discipline there. Can you talk about what you're seeing? What's making you back off incrementally here? And what areas are you really stepping back from? Thanks. Timothy Sloan : Yes, I apologize if you took away from my earlier comment that we're adopting a more conservative time. We've always been a conservative commercial real estate lender that's why we become the largest commercial real estate lender because you got to be able to adapt through cycles. Having said that from time-to-time and again, this can be quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year there's a fair amount of competition in stabilized commercial real estate projects, I mean there's lots of liquidity out there. And so this quarter there just happen to be more transactions that we\u2019ve looked at where we said, gosh, another risk return it just isn\u2019t there, but I wouldn't describe it, and that's more based on underlying risk return in an individual transaction as opposed to stepping away from any region or any product type within CRE. John Pancari : Okay, great. Thanks Tim. Timothy Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, guys. Timothy Sloan : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Tim, can you share with us \u2013 obviously, you are centralizing a number of the processes as you guys have described and how do you ensure that you maintain the incentives or the entrepreneurial spirit, if you will, of your people in growing the business? Centralizing could kind of slow down the process for loan approvals and such? Can you share with us what you're doing to try to prevent that from happening? Timothy Sloan : Well, I think it\u2019s a really good question. I mean when you think about the amount of change that's happening at the Company, there is no question, there can be impacts in terms of how we're interacting with our customers. And the way that you guard against that is that you talk about it a lot, you make sure that when you're \u2013 for example centralizing all of your \u2013 our HR functions that we've got the right service level understandings between our aligned folks and our HR folks were as we centralize some of our risk functions that we've got an understanding. And then you encourage folks to provide feedback. You ask our enterprise functions to think about themselves as service providers and their customers are the lines of business. And as you can imagine, you get feedback in terms of the decisions we made and things you've done. And in some places you might go little bit far, you get that feedback and then you make adjustments. But I think it's \u2013 making sure you've got a plan in place, making sure that you've got the right team in place, asking folks to provide a lot of feedback and then responding to that feedback. And so far, I think we're doing a good job, but it's something we talk about a lot Gerard. John Shrewsberry : And one thing I would add is that today the people who have been centralized are the same people who were serving or working in the business or for the business to be entrepreneurial and get things done. As you described, the tax will be what happens as the generation changes and we have new people. Timothy Sloan : Right. John Shrewsberry : We never were in the business that are in those centralized roles into they provide \u2013 how do we make sure that they provide the same level of support and service back to the business. Gerard Cassidy : And John with that is there a time line? Is it we should know in two years or 18 months that you've been successful in keeping that entrepreneurial spirit or is it further out? And it just takes a while before\u2026 John Shrewsberry : I think the timeline is for ever\u2026 Timothy Sloan : Yes, the timeline is for ever, but just to be clear, like you're describing, one of the potential vulnerabilities, there is a list as long as your arm of the great things that come out of having pulled together people to provide a common service at a \u2013 in a more effective way, which creates better experiences. So the upside is huge. Not only to save money. That's a great plus. But for all of these things that our businesses we're doing for themselves. They weren't doing at it scale and now we can provide it scale with the best tools, the most highly trained people, the deepest bench. It's like, it's a benefit. So I\u2019d encourage you to think about it that way to. Gerard Cassidy : Sure. And you mentioned, if I heard correctly, that people now digitally can open up accounts online. What type of loan products can people apply for and get approved for? I'm sorry, through the mobile app? What type of loan products can people actually apply for through the mobile app? For example, quick and mortgage probably familiar with they have the Rocket Mortgage that you do through the phone. Are you guys there yet with that type of product or other loan products where consumers can actually apply and get approved for them through the mobile device? Timothy Sloan : So the short answer is, not enough. And that was one of the areas that we highlighted at Investor Day within our mortgage business. We're working on our own online capabilities. And right now, we're piloting it for our team members and so far the response for our team members who are taking mortgage has been very good. In fact has been much better than what our expectations were. And so our plan is to end to pilot that for non-team member customers later in the year and roll it out next year and we think it will be a step above anybody else in the market. On the small business side and you can \u2013 if you're a Wells Fargo customer, you can go online and you can open up or apply for a loan and will give an answer in 45 seconds or 60 seconds or something like that. We have more work to do from a credit card standpoint. But our goal over the next couple years is to make sure that on the consumer side, all of our products and services are available online and as many as possible on mobile, probably less likely mortgage is going to be on mobile, but we're going to improve the capabilities across the board. Gerard Cassidy : Great, and then just finally shifting gears on the total loan portfolio, obviously year-over-year essentially flat, but one of the growth areas has been your commercial foreign loans? They're up over 10% year-over-year? Can you share with us where that growth is coming from? Grant that I know it's less than well below 10% of total loans, but where is the growth coming from? And second, where do you see that growing to? How big could that business be, since you're seeing some good growth there? Timothy Sloan : So Gerard, recall that within our Wholesale Banking business, we have a Global Financial Institutions business with offices located around the world and we have a real benefit given the quality of our balance sheet as also the quality of our products and services in terms of the relationships that we have with other financial institutions around the world. They'd like doing business with us. And so in the second quarter, we saw some growth. In the first quarter, we didn't see growth. In addition, when you think about what our international strategy is separate from the global financial institutions business. It's to help our customers when they want to do more business outside the U.S. or help non-U.S. customers do business here and we continue to see good benefit from that very focused strategy. We're not trying to be all things to all people, but gosh, if you look over the last five years or so, I think we've been growing those activities that are kind of mid double-digit rate. So I wouldn't say it's any region around the world in particular or any product set. But I think about it is over time in global financial institution and then in that very targeted global banking strategy Gerard Cassidy : Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you. Timothy Sloan : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Hey Nancy. Nancy Bush : Good morning, guys. How are you? Timothy Sloan : Good. Nancy Bush : Yes. Couple of questions. Back to the sales practices issue, I think you mentioned that you had preliminary court approval for the $142 million settlement. Could you just summarize for us what other suits issues, et cetera that have been publicly disclosed that are out there? Is there anything major that's still outstanding at this point? Timothy Sloan : Well, the $142 million settlement that was preliminary approved by the court. We believe addresses the other class action suits that are sales practices related. I think there are about 10 that are out there. So we have high expectations that ultimately that preliminary approval will become final approval after we execute on what we're being \u2013 we agreed to do, which of course we're going to do that. In terms of other activities out there, we have consent orders and plans that were for both OCC and the CFPB that we need to comply with and we're working very hard to be able to do that. And has been discussed, there's been \u2013 there is an investigation that's still going on by the Justice Department and we will continue to provide more disclosures in the disclosure of that in the 10-Q in the 10-K, but there's nothing really new that's different in the 10-Q as it relates to other legal matters for sales practices with the exception of the announcement of this preliminary approval from the court on this settlement. Nancy Bush : The CFPB\u2019s recent move on arbitration versus class action or versus lawsuits, I mean I'm assuming that will not be retroactive, I mean if you had a chance to sort of look at that and see if it's going to have any impact on what happens going forward? Timothy Sloan : Well, I think that lots of folks have had an opinion on this and not only in Washington, but also various business groups and so on. I'm not going to applying on the legality or illegality of what they're doing whether it's retroactive \u2013 I don't think it's retroactive. But I think there is a lot of concern about this decision and I think that my guess is that based on the feedback that we'll see legislative or administrative and legal action against it. Nancy Bush : Okay. And just finally on the subject, there have been several large municipalities that have several relationships with Wells Fargo. I think New York City may have been the last one, you have to refresh me on that. But is there \u2013 I mean my understanding of this municipalities business, and it's primarily liquidity management, it tends not to be terribly profitable business et cetera, I mean obviously you don't want to lose it, but I'm just trying to see if there are any trends that we can sort of track to that right now and where to look on the income statement to see if there is an impact? Timothy Sloan : Sure. But overall, I think the punch line is there hasn't been a material impact to the Company for all the decisions made or some of the decisions made by some of our municipal customers. But you're right, there been some cities, some states who put us on a freeze or put us on probation or something for some period of time because they want to see that we're going to fulfill the obligations that we have related to sales practice and of course we're going to do that. And our expectation Nancy is that we're going to win all that business back. A great example is the State of California recently put us on probation and then we competed very hard and won some municipal business because we provided the best option for the citizens of California and for the state. The fact of the matter is that there's a lot of reporting on when politicians stand before a podium and talk about how they want to put us a freeze on Wells Fargo for a while. It doesn't get reported is the fact that most of our municipal and GIB customers are continuing to do business with. They love working with Wells Fargo. And in fact, one example of that is, you saw the growth and balances in the second quarter of $1.1 billion in our Government and Institutional Banking business. So that business continues to perform well, we're going to win all the business back and we're going to fulfill the obligations that we\u2019ve and promises we've made all those customers. John Shrewsberry : One nuance to your question, Nancy, you mentioned it tends to be the portion of the business at least profitable. Most of these relationships are complex relationships where we're a credit provider. We're managing their cash because a very few institutions can manage liquidity and manage cash like we do. And then we might also be doing some investing for them or some bond placement for them or some risk management stuff for them and the ones that I've tracked since we\u2019ve begun usually we've been sort as Tim describes it put the box for a year or for two years on bond underwritings. But it's \u2013 they go through a painstaking process to pick their partners on who provides credit and who manages their cash. And it takes years to switch those things, if they decided to and we have a tenancy not to want to do that. So the core underlying piece of the business tends to be actually quite good. Nancy Bush : Okay. Thank you. Timothy Sloan : Yes, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. So I had a quick question, first I think an easier one on the oil and gas loan portfolio I know the reserve still at almost 8% for the overall portfolio, but given the slight pullback in the oil prices, could you give us kind of a little bit color on the portfolio today versus where it was [indiscernible], is there a actual number for oil prices per barrel that you kind of get more concerns about your oil book? John Shrewsberry : Also on your last question first, I wouldn't say there's an exact price. The production is migrated to the most efficient producers. So whatever that prices that would make people disturb, it's a lower price than what you might have thought a couple of years-ago. The portfolio overall is now about 1.3% of our total loan portfolio, $12.7 billion is down 10% year-over-year. We had $20 million of charge-offs in the portfolio this quarter, which is down $80 million from the prior quarter. Oil and gas not accruals or at $1.8 billion down called it $230 million linked-quarter, criticized assets are $4.5 billion down $0.5 billion linked-quarter and the remaining oil as you said is almost 8% outstanding. So I think we feel good about where we are. We got after this early, we built reserves against it to what we thought was the right level and then we're coming out the other side of it. We the whole it's of course more than keeping an eye on the price of crude, this is both an oil and gas business and we've got hundreds of professionals in market. We\u2019re working with all of our customers all the time to help them manage down the risk and it doesn't feel like an area of concern in the resource prices, the neighborhood that we\u2019re operating in. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then on the primary consumer checking customers, I know there's still more opening and closing at this point in time, but the growth rate is still decelerating. So do you have a better handle on one that will actually start to inflect and see a better growth rate, I know you\u2019ve done investments in the marketing spend picked up this year. I mean is it next quarter we should see that inflect. Is that the fourth quarter, can you some insight on the timing there? Timothy Sloan : Well, I think it's going to continue to occur over time and I think that that it's - I wouldn't say the inflections tomorrow or a week from tomorrow or next quarter I think our expectation is that we're going to continue to grow from the current levels and being - every quarter is a little bit different. But my encouragement of view is to look a year from now and see where we are. John Shrewsberry : Little more context on that metric because we've been pointing towards relying on that metric and increasingly over the last couple of years and in the early days of really emphasizing that metric, one of the things that we were working through is the conversion of customers who were Wells Fargo customers, but we're primary customers to a primary status by encouraging them to do that giving them reasons to do it, giving them capabilities et cetera, but a compelling value proposition. And so setting sales practices aside, we had been working through that stock of people who were already customers, but weren\u2019t primary. So in any event even if we hadn't had sale practices issues that was going to slow down. Now we've got the sales practices issues to recover from and we also have the fact that we've converted as many or probably as many as are going to be converted from non-primary status. So it's really going to reflect taking business from other people and getting more than our fair share of new household formation or new bank customer formation as it happens over time. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, perfect. Thanks. Timothy Sloan : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Timothy Sloan : Hey Marty. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Marty. Marty Mosby : Thanks for taking the questions. I want to talk about mortgage banking. It used to be a real powerhouse for Wells Fargo. And couple of years ago on Investor Day, we actually had a mortgage banking \u2013 talk about [indiscernible] finally turn the corner after we come out of this financial crisis. And here we have a seasonal quarter where you sort of seen an uptick and we actually had treasury rates falling, which should have been a better delivery quarter, but we have margins fell off. So just the innate trends and metrics of the business just don't think to be working the way that I\u2019ve grown used to it in my history, so I was just interested to see how you think about the business and how do we get this thing turned around? Timothy Sloan : Well, Marty I might push back just a bit and that is that one of the decisions that we've made over the last few years is to make sure that we're building this business for the long-term and to eliminate any portions of the business that we would describe is providing additional amount of risk. So we got out of the wholesale funding or wholesale mortgage we've got out of reverse mortgages. We exited the direct FHA business because of the potential liabilities and so during the period that you're describing what we've been trying to do is really build the business for the long-term. We made most of \u2013 all those changes, and now as we look toward the future, we think it's really critical to make sure that we've got for example that online product that Gerard ask about, and which we're in process of and it will be rolling out next year. And our expectation is that we will continue to grow this business in the short term. As John mentioned what happened this quarter was just the mix between correspondent and direct shifted a little bit. But also remember in the background that because of the size of our servicing book in periods where there's a lot of refinance activity, we get a disproportionate amount of share relative to the rest of the industry proportionate for us. So I wouldn't throw in the towel on the mortgage business. There is huge opportunities here. There is huge opportunities to grow the first mortgage business. There is huge opportunities to grow the second mortgage business, and Franklin and team are very focused on that. John Shrewsberry : One more thing I\u2019d add Marty that doesn't show up in the mortgage banking line item, but we're making non-conforming prime jumbo mortgage loans handover for our best customers and then they show up on our balance sheet. So they contribute to net interest income, but they don't flow through the mortgage banking line item in the same way. And so we think the business is the combination of those things, some of it\u2019s shifted because of our emphasis on higher credit quality and that loan balance cutoff, puts those on our books. So there\u2019s a variety of things, all de-risking. Last thing I\u2019d say is that, as I mentioned for those loans that are on our books and we are the biggest mortgage lender, we had a net recovery in credit in the quarter. So we like the credit profile that we're putting on our books as well. Marty Mosby : Got it. So really is that holding more on the balance sheet as well, like you were saying kind of retooling the business. So this should be the kind of basing of that and we should hopefully begin to see some improvement in the market and the business now being able to improve from here. So that hopefully will be what we'll see over the next couple years. And the other thing I want to ask you about was when I looked at your deposit rates, what would be your MMDA or kind of the savings, money market savings aligned where the majority of your deposits are, the rate has done really well had increased several basis points. But the line right above it, which is really the checking account has been going up almost with the Fed fund rate, so it's somewhat surprising that your checking account is going up faster than your savings account. So it has to be kind of an anomaly in that account. Is that just more corporate related? Is that how you kind of classify it? Or was just curious why that rate is moving up so fast? John Shrewsberry : Yes, that's more commercial and corporate-related. On the consumer side because of the service convenience that we can provide \u2013 as we've talked about in the past, we were trying not to compete on price, and that's what you're seeing across the rest of the industry. I think the growth that you're seeing is primarily on the commercial in the corporate side, particularly medium and larger corporate some financial institution were candidly, it\u2019s much more price sensitive. It's still been increasing at less than the rise in short-term rates, but that's what explains it. Marty Mosby : And the checking account just more is that more Treasury type of products in that, what you actually show interest-bearing checking is that first line on that supplement? Timothy Sloan : They\u2019re indexed to a variety of things, but\u2026 Marty Mosby : Right, got it. All right. Thanks. End of Q& A Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Timothy Sloan : Well, thank you very much for spending part of your morning. I know it's a very, very busy day. And I hope as you review our results and reflect on our comments today that you are as optimistic about the future of Wells Fargo as we are. So again, thank you for your time and have a good rest of the day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. And you may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn our call over to CEO and President, Tim Sloan. Tim Sloan : Thank you, John. Good morning. I want to thank you all for joining us today. Over the past year, we have made fundamental changes at Wells Fargo in order to build a better and stronger bank. And John and I'll be highlighting our progress throughout the call. But first I want to discuss our financial performance. In the third quarter, we earned $0.84 a share; including the impact of a $1 billion discrete litigation accrual for previously disclosed mortgage related regulatory investigations. This is not tax deductible and reduced our EPS by $0.20. This accrual was for a pre financial crisis mortgage related regulatory matter. While this accrual impacted our financial performance in the quarter, the commitment of our team members to put our customers first and help them to succeed financially remains strong and was demonstrated by average deposits growing 4% from a year ago, client assets reaching record levels in wealth and investment management, debit card purchase volume increasing 5% from a year ago, balances in our consumer and general purpose credit card portfolio also growing 5%. And illustrating the benefit of the GE Capital acquisitions and strong collaboration across our wholesale businesses, we led more syndicated asset base loans in any other firm in the third quarter. As part of our priority of rebuilding trust, we provided expanded disclosure in our second quarter 10-Q filing, detailing our efforts to identify and address other areas and instances where customers may have experienced financial harm. Let me update you on a few recent actions and milestones. At the end of August, we announced the completion of an expanded third party review of retail banking accounts covering 165 million accounts over a nearly eight year period. As we committed to a year ago we reviewed more accounts over a longer period of time and identified additional customers who may have been impacted. All customers identified as having potentially unauthorized accounts are being notified directly as to how they can participate in a $142 million class action settlement and we are refunding customers for any of these accounts that experienced fees and charges. Last week we completed another around of broad customer outreach via email in 43 million statement notifications to encourage anyone with questions about their accounts regardless of when they were opened to let us know so we could address their questions.  We also announced in August a plan to remediate auto loan customers who may have been financially harmed due to issues related to collateral protection insurance policies which we purchased on their behalf when customers' insurance policies lapsed. We discontinued our CPI program last year and we began issuing checks to affected auto loan customers this month. Last week, we announced plans to reach out to all home lending customers who paid fees for mortgage rate lock extensions requested from September 16th of 2013 through February 28th of 2017 and to refund customers who believe they shouldn't have paid those fees.  In March of this year, we changed how we managed the mortgage rate lock extension process by establishing a centralized review team that reviews all rate lock extension request for a consistent application of our policies. We are working diligently to make things right for our customers. We will continue to be transparent and we will be reporting more progress in months ahead.  We are working hard to transform Wells Fargo into a better bank for our customers, our team members, shareholders and our communities. I'm proud of the progress our team members have made to strengthen our culture, improve our business practices and risk management. We made fundamental changes to our business model, organizational structure and compensation and performance management programs. One reason I am confident that we are on the right path is it in the third quarter total team member attrition at Wells Fargo reached its lowest level in over six years. Within Community Banking, attrition is also at its lowest level in over six years and it has improved every quarter over the past year. Our customers are also responding positively to the changes we've made. While branch customer loyalty and satisfaction with most recent visit scores decline slightly in September after our announcement of the completion of the expanded third party account review, both metrics had reached individual post sales practices settlements high earlier in the quarter. And we saw improvement in loyalty scores near the end of the September. We also continue to invest in innovation to better serve our customers. Let me highlight a few examples. Since launching the Zelle person-to-person experience in June, we've seen significant growth in both the number of transactions and the dollar sent. In the third quarter, P-to-P payment sent by our customers increased 46% from a year ago. We've recently launched a pilot of our online mortgage application. It combines the power of Wells Fargo data with the digital interface to create a know-me customer experience. We expect a complete rollout in the first quarter of next year. Later this month, we'll rollout Intuitive Investor, a new digital advisory offering providing low cost allocation, portfolio selection and rebalancing. We launched CEO Mobile Token which allows our treasury management customers a secured, convenient way to provide secondary authentication anytime they need to complete a transaction. Since the first quarter when we became the first large bank in the US to offer card free access to all of our ATMs through a one time access code, our customers have used card free ATM access codes 3 million times. And just this last we week announced than more than 40% of our ATMs are now NFC- enabled which allows our debit card customers to use their mobile wallet at the ATM providing another option for card free access.  Citing our card free ATMs along with a number of new capabilities, Wells Fargo was also recognized as the industry leader in Business Insider's mobile banking study that was released this week.  Before turning the call over to John, I want to acknowledge the devastation many of our communities have faced from the recent hurricanes. To help our impacted customers in those areas recover we are providing payment relief and proactively waiving fees. Our mobile response unit was deployed to impacted areas in Texas a month ago and we are deploying three additional units to Florida so customers can receive in person assistance from Wells Fargo disaster recovery specialist. The Wells Fargo Foundation donated $2.6 million for hurricane relief efforts in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, and our customers have generously donated over $2.6 million to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund through our ATMs nationwide. We are also working with our customers impacted by the wildfires in California and the Wells Fargo Foundation made a donation to help these communities this week.  John Shrewsberry will now discuss our financial results in more detail. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We earned $4.6 billion in the third quarter, down $1.2 billion from the second quarter. This decline was driven by higher operating losses from the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual that Tim described. Linked-quarter trends were also impacted by the $100 million reserve release we had in the second quarter. This quarter we did not have a release as improvements and credit performance in certain portfolios were offset by a $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane related losses based on initial review of our portfolio. As a reminder, our result in the second quarter also reflected a $309 million gain on the sale of Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio.  On Page 3, we highlighted our results compared with a year ago. While net interest income increased $524 million, revenue declined $402 million reflecting lower non-interest income, driven by lower mortgage results. Average loans declined 1% from a year ago as grown in our commercial loans was more than offset by lower consumer loans, while average deposits increased 4% from a year ago. And we've maintained exceptionally strong capital levels even as we've returned more capital to shareholders including $96 million reduction in common shares outstanding through net share repurchases.  Turning to Page 4, I'll be highlighting trends in loans deposits and credit later on the call, so let me just call out a few items from this slide. Cash and short-term investments increased to $7.4 billion, reflecting lower loan balances and growth in deposits. With our strong liquidity levels we could deploy tens of billions of dollars and remain LCR compliant.  Investment securities increased $5 billion in the quarter, we had approximately $31.2 billion of gross investment purchases in the quarter, primary agency MBS in the available for sale portfolio which were largely offset by run-off in sales. Turning to the income statement overview on Page 5, I'll describe revenue and expense trends later on the call. So let me just highlight that our effective income tax rate in the third quarter was 32.4%. This included net discrete tax expense of $186 million primarily resulting from the non deductible treatment of the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual, partially offset by discrete tax benefits arising from favorable resolutions of prior period matter of certain state tax authorities. As shown on Page 6, the benefit from higher rates increased average loan yields 5 basis points in the quarter, the seventh consecutive quarter of increasing loan yields. Average loan yields were down $5.2 billion from a year ago with growth in commercial loans offset by declines in consumer loans and down $4.6 billion from the second quarter with declines in both commercial and consumer loans. H.8 data continue to indicate that there was softness across the industry, particularly in certain categories like C&I, but they're also specific actions that we've taken, primarily driven by our own risk discipline, which have impacted our growth. Let me explain the primary factors in more detail. Starting with commercial loans on Page 7, lien utilization rate remain stable at approximately 40% in the third quarter and balance is increased $3.7 billion from a year ago, but declined $5.7 billion from the second quarter. We've previously highlighted expected run-off within our consumer portfolio but we've also had expected run-off in certain portfolios of commercial loan. We provided $6.5 billion of financing relating to our government guarantee student loan sale in the fourth quarter of 2014 which is then securitized in several tranches over the past couple of years with $1.3 billion remaining at the end of the third quarter down approximately $800 million from the second quarter.  We fully anticipated the run down of a couple of loan portfolios we acquired from GE Capital and pay downs have totaled $7.9 billion over the past 18 months including $1.7 billion in the third quarter with approximately half of the reduction in the quarter in C&I and half in commercial real estate. On this slide we provide details on the individual loan portfolios that drove commercial loan trends this quarter.  We summarize our consumer loan portfolios on Page 8. This portfolio declined $13.1 billion from a year-ago, primarily due to $7.4 billion of lower auto loans and $7 billion of lower junior lien mortgage loans. However, consumer loans increased $200 million from the second quarter with growth in first mortgage loans and credit card. Our first mortgage loans increased $3.6 billion from the second quarter, reflecting $7.5 billion of growth in non-conforming mortgage loans, partially offset by the continued run-off of higher yielding legacy portfolios. Our junior lien mortgage loan portfolio continued to decline as expected as pay-downs more than offset new originations. In terms of credit card portfolio, over the past three years our annual growth rate was the largest among the large banks. Clearly the sales practice announcement last year had an impact but we started gain a bit of momentum. Our credit portfolio increased $944 million linked quarter driven by higher spend per active account. We've invested in our rewards program and had continued our migration to digital acquisition while staying within our risk appetite. In fact, 42% of card openings in the third quarter were through digital channels, up from 17% in the full year of 2016. Our auto portfolio continued to decline as expected and was down $2.5 billion from the second quarter as a result of tightening underwriting standards. We expect auto loans to continue to decline. Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $252 million from the second quarter driven by declines in personal loans and lines which we expect to continue to decline due to lower branch referrals over the past year.  As highlighted on Page 9, average deposits were $1.3 trillion, up $44.9 billion or 4% from a year-ago and up $5.2 billion from the second quarter. Based on the latest FDIC data, we retained our number one ranking in retail deposits. Our deposit cost was 26 basis points in the third quarter, up 5 basis points from the second quarter and up 15 basis points from a year ago. We've not made material changes in rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits within our retail bank with the majority of our peers also holding these rates steady. We have implemented some incremental deposits repricing for commercial and wealth and investment management customers as market rates have increased.  Net interest income increased $524 million, or 4% from a year-ago primarily driven by growth in earnings assets and higher interest rates. However, net interest income declined $7 million from the second quarter as the impacts of lower investment portfolio yields driven by accelerated prepayments and lower average loan balances were largely offset by the impact of one additional day in the quarter and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing.  The net interest margin declined 3 basis points to 2.87% as the impact of lower investment portfolio yields driven by accelerated prepayments, lower average loan balances, growth in average deposits and growth in trading assets and related funding were partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth and repricing. For the first nine months of the year, we've growth net interest income by 5% which is consistent with our previously stated expected of low to mid-single digit growth for the full year 2017.  Non-interest income declined $926 million from a year-ago, driven by lower mortgage banking revenue and was $236 million from the second quarter. Let me highlight few of the drivers of this decline. Card purchase volume increased but card fees declined $19 million from the second quarter due to higher reward expense. We offered competitive rewards and our expense is increased due to high purchase volume, more spending on our highest reward card and higher acquisition bonuses. Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $102 million from the second quarter. Servicing income declined $91 million from the second quarter primarily due to higher on reimburse direct servicing cost driven by an increased and estimated cost for aged FHA foreclosures while origination volume increased, residential mortgage origination revenue decline due to a lower repurchase reserve release. Residential mortgage origination volume was $59 billion in the third quarter, up 5% from the second quarter and higher refinancing volume. The production margin on residential held for sale mortgage origination was 124 basis points in the third quarter consistent with the second quarter. Compared with the second quarter there was a favorable impact of $72 million from net hedge ineffectiveness accounting. The FASB has issued new hedge accounting guideline that we will adopt in the fourth quarter which will significantly reduce the interest rate related to foreign currency related ineffectiveness associated with our long-term debt hedges due to the way we structured our hedging instruments, we may continue to experience some ineffectiveness volatility primarily related to require differences in the discount rates for our foreign currency denominated long-term debt and associated cross - currency interest rate swaps.  On Page 12, we provide details on trading related revenue and the impact to net interest income and non-interest income. Despite decline in customer trading activity, revenue driven by lower volatility and seasonally lower trading volumes, trading related revenue increased $52 million from the second quarter. Trading related revenue was down $29 million from a year ago, reflecting lower volatility and lower transaction volume.  As shown on Page 13, expenses increased $810 million from the second quarter, driven by $1 billion litigation accrual. The discrete litigation accrual increased our efficiency ratio by 456 basis points in the third quarter. Last quarter we said that we expected our efficiency ratio to improve in the second half of the year and that our full year efficiency ratio was expected to be 60% to 61% in 2017 not including any potential non-recurring expenses including not get accrued litigation expense. We currently expect our full year 2017 efficiency ratio to be plus or minus 61% excluding the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual and any other non-recurring expenses including not yet accrued litigation expense. The reason why our 2017 efficiency ratio is now expected to be higher than we anticipated last quarter is due to lower than expected earning asset growth and higher than expected expenses, primarily for cyber regulatory initiatives and data modernization. These expenses are part of a building a better bank. However, we are fully committed to improving our efficiency ratio and achieving our target of total of $4 billion of expense reductions. As you can see on Page 14, we had linked quarter declines across many of our expense categories except for revenue related expenses and running the business non discretionary expenses which is a category impacted by the $1 billion litigation accrual. The increase in revenue related expenses was primarily due to higher commissions and other incentive compensation driven by wholesale banking and brokerage. The $24 million decline in compensation expense was driven by seasonally lower payroll tax expense. Third party service expense declined $82 million from the second quarter driven by lower project related, legal and outside data processing expense. Running the business discretionary expense was down $34 million from second quarter primarily from lower TNE and advertising expense.  On Page 15, we showed the drivers of the year-over-year increase and expenses. Compensation and benefit expense increased $338 million driven by higher salaries from annual salary increases and higher health benefit expenses. Also these expenses in the third quarter of 2016 were reduced by the forfeiture of unvested equity award. Revenue related expense declined $131 million from lower commission and incentive compensation driven by lower mortgage and wholesale banking activity. Third party service expense increased to $184 million, driven by higher project spending and legal expense, approximately $80 million of this expense was sales practices related in the third quarter. The $665 million increase in running the business in non-discretionary expense was driven by higher operating losses reflecting the $1 billion litigation accrual. We've previously described the main drivers of the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves by the end of 2018 and we've now identified initiatives and programs for the total $4 billion of expense target. On Page 16, we summarize these initiatives and the expense categories that will be impacted and we are committed to achieving these reductions. This leverage have evolved slightly from Investor Day but are still focused on areas like centralization and optimization and evaluating capacity to achieve savings in areas such as corporate properties and workforce optimization. As you can see on this page, some of these initiatives will generate savings throughout the periods while others unexpected to be realized until later.  We are making progress and work that needs to be done on these initiatives but many of the changes that drive savings are longer term efforts and are in the early stages of being realized. For example, while we are seeing benefits from centralizing our functional areas, the saving for corporate property including savings from 200 branches we plan to close in 2017. We are on track as we closed 145 branches during the first nine months of this year. However, there are minimal immediate savings recognized from branch closure due to initial closing cost. Therefore, most of the expense benefit from the branches we close this year will not be realized until next year. It's also important to note that these initiatives do not include the benefit of the expected run-off of core deposit intangibles by 2019 which resulted in $640 million of expenses in the first nine months of the year. It also doesn't include the expected completion of the FDIC special assessment in 2018. And finally it doesn't include the expense savings due to the sale of businesses we've announced including commercial insurance and shareowner services businesses which are expected to close in the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively.  On Slide 17, we provide details on the expected timing of our target expense reductions. We expect to achieve 21% of the $4 billion of the annual expense saves by the end of this year and 50% by the end of next year. The rest of the expense saves are expected to be achieved by the end of 2019. As a reminder, the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves will support our investment in the business and we expect that the additional $2 billion target in annual expense reduction by the end of 2019 to go to the bottom line and to be fully recognized in 2020. Turning to our business segments starting on Page 18, Community Banking earned $2.2 billion in the third quarter, the impact from $1 billion litigation accrual which is reported in this segment was the primary driver of the year-over-year and linked quarter decline.  On Page 19, we highlight customers continue to actively use their accounts; branch and ATM interactions declined 6% from a year ago. This decline was driven in part by customers migrating to a digital channel with the digital secured session up 6% from a year ago. As teller interactions migrate to self service options, teller FTEs have been reduced 4% from a year ago while we continue to invest in more specialty bankers which are up 5% as part of our goal of providing better customer service and advice.  Primary consumer checking customers declined modestly from the second quarter in a year ago, while our attrition rates have remained stable, the decline in new account openings has impacted primary consumer checking customer growth. However, as we've highlighted in Investor Day, our new customers continue to have higher balances and into use their debit cards more frequently.  On Page 20, we highlight balance and activity growth. Average consumer and small business banking deposits grew by 2% from a year-ago. Debit card purchase volume increased 5% and consumer and general purpose credit card purchase volume increased 4% from a year-ago. Customer experience survey scores predictably declined after we announced the completion of the expanded third party review of retail banking accounts at the end of August. However, as Tim mentioned earlier, we continue to improve these scores prior to this announcement. While this past year has been challenging, the numbers we've made are creating more consistency -- the changes we've made are creating more consistency and simplicity for our branch team members which will result in a better experience for our customers. We know that improving the experience for customers and team members is critical to growing our business. It's more than being nice it's offering the right products and services to meet the financial needs of our customers; it's also about making changes with real customer impact for example empowering managers in the branches to immediately resolve some customer issues such as fees and service request rather than having to redirect customers to a call center. I am confident that the changes we are implementing will improve customer service and also drive growth.  Wholesale Banking earned $2 billion in the third quarter, stable from a year-ago and down 14% from the second quarter. Results from the second quarter included the tax benefit resulting from our agreement to sell Wells Fargo Insurance Services which is expected to close in the fourth quarter and resulted to gain in fourth quarter. Wealth and Investment Management earned a record $710 million in the third quarter, up 5% from a year-ago and up 4% from the second quarter. Revenue increased 4% from a year-ago driven by 19% increase in net interest income. WIM total client assets were a record $1.9 trillion, up 8% from a year ago, driven by higher market evaluations and continued positive net flows. Turning to credit quality on Page 23, the quarterly loss rate was 30 basis points, up 3 basis points from the second quarter but still near historically low levels. Commercial losses increased 3 basis points with higher losses in C&I, consumer losses increased 2 basis points as continued net recoveries in consumer real estate and lower credit card and other revolving credit were offset by higher auto losses. Nonperforming assets continue to decline down $512 million from the second quarter, the sixth consecutive quarter of decreases and NPAs were now less than 1% of total loans. We did not have a reserve build or release this quarter as continued improvement in consumer real estate and commercial loan portfolios including continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio was offset by a $450 million of reserve coverage for potential hurricane related losses based on an initial review of our portfolio. Our preliminary estimates includes coverage for potential losses in our reliable auto business which is based in Puerto Rico was been specially challenging to determine the full impact from Hurricane Maria.  Turning to Page 24, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in increased to 11.8% in the third quarter, remaining well above our internal target level of 10%. The growth in our CET 1 ratio reflected lower RWA driven by lower loan balances and commitments, as well as improved RWA efficiency. We remained focused on returning more capital to shareholders. Third quarter was the first quarter under our 2017 Capital Plan and we increased our net share repurchases by 34% from the second quarter. We've returned the total of $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases which was up 16% from the second quarter.  Before I conclude, I want to update you on our resolution planning efforts. We made a decision to move from a multiple point of entry resolution strategy to a single point of entry preferred resolution strategy for our next resolution plan submission. We've concluded the developing SPOE strategy will enhance the flexibility of strategic options available to resolve the firm. This decision does not related to any agency feedback we've received in our 2017 submission and is not expected to result in any additional fee lock issuance or liquidity requirements.  In summary, while our financial results in the third quarter were impacted by the $1 billion discrete litigation accrual, our asset quality, liquidity and capital levels all remain very strong. We highlighted throughout the call the transformational changes we are making and I am optimistic that these changes will help drive our long-term success. And I think we will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. John, I want to try again to ask about the idea of the timing differences between initial $2 billion of expense saves to be realized by the end of next year. And when the spending that is offsetting that is occurring, if you could kind of comment on that. And then if you have an initial thought on type of efficiency ratio that you guys might strive for next year. I am sure folks will love to hear any thoughts on that. John Shrewsberry : Sure. So we provided this slide on the deck this time that shows what portion of that first $2 billion should be out of the run rate by the end of this year and what portion should be out of the run rate by the end of next year which is incremental information. The part that's hard to convey is what is already being spent as reinvestment of that for a variety of programs. We've talked about a lot of these but we've had and will continue to have elevated spending around various regulatory and technology related activities. Now just tick few off for you including resolution planning this year which doesn't completely go away. This BSA and AML activity going on, lot of cyber work going on. I mentioned data modernization earlier in our remarks which is a big undertaking is technology re-platforming and this of course your sales practices issues that are lingering. So some of those are in the run rate today. And many of those will continue to be in the run rate throughout 2018 and maybe some of it even into 2019. There are bits and pieces of getting more efficient on those programs that are part of that $2 billion save that we are working on. So it's not dollar for dollar if as these things roll off and that first $2 billion gets realized those benefit, but with respect to efficiency ratio we think that will be sort in the -- as I mentioned plus or minus 61% from the fourth quarter and it is definitely our goal to be at 59% or below at some point next year. Now there is two parts to that. One is expenses which we are talking about but it is also what happens with revenue. So rate increases, if there are any loan growth which is very important will contribute to that too. So it is both the numerator and denominator that we are working on. But I'll say we are shooting for plus or minus 61% in the fourth quarter and we are -- we like to get to 59% or below at some point during 2018. John McDonald : Okay. And then separately could you talk about some of the factors affecting net interest income and net interest margin for next quarter? With the loan growth headwinds not having a rate hike in September, is it possible to have net interest income growth going forward or what are your thoughts there? John Shrewsberry : That's good question. So it depends on a few things including what you mentioned. It also depends on what happens to deposit pricing and what the market response is in retail deposits in particular. I wouldn't anticipate a lot of incremental growth in interest income in the fourth quarter. I think we are at 5% [here today] [ph] on year-over-year basis and we've been imagining and telegraphing low to mid 4% to 5% for the year as a whole. So I think the fourth quarter will probably reflect that especially because as you said nothing moved on short end, the long ends moved a little bit but that only matters at the margin as we reinvest. John McDonald : Okay. And one quick last one for me. The business sales that you mentioned in the fourth quarter and the first are helpful to the efficiency ratio. Are those relatively earnings neutral? Is there any loss of earnings as those businesses go away? John Shrewsberry : They are relatively earnings -- the run rate which I think is what you are referring to is relatively earnings neutral going forward. John McDonald : Okay. Meaning when you sell them there is no net income that goes away, they are pretty P&L neutral. John Shrewsberry : Yes. The only complication that adds is indirect expense because we have a work to do take up the associated indirect expense but in general I'd say that that we will not be giving up a lot of net income. John McDonald : Okay. Meaning you will just take some time to get the expenses out. John Shrewsberry : Yes. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Yes. Hi, thank you for taking my questions. My first question is for you Tim. I think that as I speak with your current and prospective shareholders, the biggest sort of question mark in terms of visibility into next year is not really on the expense management side but really on the revenue side. You started out this call with the list of the remedies that you've done on the community bank. I guess the question for me is in terms of the overall culture of the bank how much is the wholesale bank being impacted by the issues and the scandal on the community bank? In other words, is it impacting risk appetite? Is it impacting growth initiatives? Is it impacting your ability to hire? Tim Sloan : The short answer as it relates to wholesale banking, Erika, it is a great question, is no, I mean at the margin and our government and institutional banking business. There is a little bit of impact on some municipalities they have put us on probation or just said they are not going to use as much for a period of time. Though we had some municipalities that have taken us off that because we've executed on everything we said we are going to execute over the last year. So it's not impacting our ability to hire people. And I mentioned attrition for the entire company but the same would go for wholesale banking in terms of lower attrition so we are not losing people. And is not affecting our credit appetite at all. And again I think wholesale banking performance in the quarter was good and I'd say the same thing for wealth and investment management. I mean you saw real good performance there. So there is no question that there is impact. We've talked about that. John provided a number of details in his presentation as it relates to some of our consumer businesses but for the rest of the company we are continuing to move forward. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just thank you so much for providing the new slide, slide 17, in terms of what we can expect to be achieved when. And I am wondering as we think about 4Q, 2019, John, is it a simple as saying okay let's assume a core run rate for Wells Fargo, let's say it's the $13.3 billion this quarter excluding the $1 billion in litigation accrual, assume a growth rate off of that and then deduct $500 million. Is that what falling to the bottom line means by 4Q, 2019? John Shrewsberry : That's elegant but I guess the way I think about it -- I think about it is you got to take a snapshot of a business mix that throws off its -- each component which throws of its own efficiency ratio and I expect us frankly to get more efficient in the businesses as we roll forward. But as you look forward a year we should have taken out call it 40% of the first $2 billion and the rest of it to be coming out at the end of next year. So obviously that will be phasing-in through that period of time. You will have these harder to gauge elevated program related expenses for the types of items that I mentioned that sort of happening over the top. They have been for a little while and I anticipate the next 12 or 18 months will be -- there will be a lot of it going on. So I don't know much will be rolling off exactly at the end of the next -- nobody knows exactly how much will be rolling off at the end of next year. But that's a big number. And then we began to have this structural take out like the amortization, deposit intangible, the extra FDIC premium and the cost of the exited businesses although those will be happening earlier in 2018. So those are the moving pieces as I see them. Now with something new could occur to that changes the business but those are the big items and the way that are moving that as we forecast through 2018 and into 2019 are the drivers of where we are going to be. And with that an expectation for revenue that's what makes us think that we will get down to 61% for 2017 in the fourth quarter and hope to get to 59% in 2018. Erika Najarian : And just one last question, a follow up on the revenue side of the 2018 efficiency equation. Is there idiosyncratic catalyst for the margin decline that you would like to point out that impacted performance for this year? Or maybe a better way to ask if the Fed does raise rate in December could you walk us through what the impact would be for 1Q, 2018 that would be perhaps different from what we saw this quarter? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So with respect to year-over-year margin and what's going on I mean it's what you imagine. We've got different categories of earnings assets they are priced differently investment securities loans, short -term investment et cetera. We've got mix and we have repricing. And the sort of weighted average of that matrix is the benefit in a rising rate environment, and then we've got deposits, we've got long-term debt, other funding liabilities, we've got mix and we've got repricing that's the negative in a rising rate environment. And that's what -I think we are five basis points up year-over-year but if there is a move in December and we roll into the beginning of the year and the easy calculation is actually our parallel move, so I'll give you the number for a parallel move. We think that's probable all things being equal that's probably worth $90 million a quarter including in the first quarter. So now things don't happen in parallel. We don't know what's going to happen at the longer end but and the big question mark about that is what is the deposit response in retail that bigger banks either cause or impacted by on the next move because we model a reasonably meaningful response and yet we haven't seen what yet so there could be upside to that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hey, guys, how are doing? Good morning. Hey, can you talk a little bit about just the loan growth expectations? I know John in your prepared remarks you talked through a couple of the buckets where you are continuing to let things roll off. But obviously we are seeing the period end come in lower than the averages in part because of that. Can you just talk about end demand and try to separate end demand and customer growth from perhaps any lagging ramification of retail sales and the slower account growth in terms of how you expect loans to traject going forward? Tim Sloan : Ken, it's Tim. You are talking about fourth quarter next year in term from the timeframe standpoint? Ken Usdin : Yes. Just your general outlook for when do you we see kind of bottoming in loan growth and how much of that kind of let go part is weighing on the overall amount of growth that you are seeing? Tim Sloan : So let me start with the portfolios that are likely to decline over that period and then we'll get to the ones that are going to increase. So as we've highlighted for last few quarters, I think it's likely that the auto portfolio will continue to decline over the next few quarters. Our expectation is it probably bottom out sometime second half of next year. I think the home equity portfolio will also continue to decline though our expectation is that next year all other things being equal will originate more home equity loan than what we did this year. But again recall there still that legacy portion of that portfolio that's burning off that we used to be very concerned about from a loss standpoint and it is now performing beyond all of our expectations. I expect the credit card portfolio to continue to grow. We saw that this quarter that was absolutely terrific driven by some really good improvement in digital acquisition. And so all the investments that we are making in the credit card business and our digital platform are working. I expect the on balance sheet mortgage portfolio to grow during that period. There will be some seasonality in the fourth and first quarter we've seen but again like we saw this quarter, we saw good growth in the first mortgage residential portfolio. And then on the wholesale side and commercial side we expect to see growth throughout that period. John highlighted some of the idiosyncratic reasons why we saw some decline this year. But our expectation is going to continue to grow. Having said all that, the reason we became the largest lender in this country is because we look at the market, we look at our customer demand and we want to make sure we are making good, long-term credit decision. So sometimes in a quarter it means you grow, sometimes you shrink but over the long term we are very confident we are going to be able to continue to grow. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then if I could just dig in on the commercial business specifically. The biggest of the loan buckets on the wholesale side. Even maybe some granularity there in terms of -- I know the specifics that John mentioned but obviously C&I had slowed overall and what do you just seeing in terms of customer demand and where that growth would come from inside that commercial business ? Tim Sloan : Oh I think again we called out some specifics for example in this quarter we had a number of larger CRE construction loans that paid off and that's again that's going to be little bit episodic but overall view is that we are going to see growth across the entire portfolio again because we are in so many businesses, each business is going to have a little bit different complexion in the quarter. We highlighted the fact that because of the GE Capital acquisition we are now the number one asset base lender and we are pretty excited about that. That hasn't necessary happened over last few years so there is -- we think there is good upside there but really across the board we are optimistic about being able to grow. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And on the flip side just if I can ask the question about your credit in general and you are kind of got to this point where your charge-off bounced up a little bit and you didn't really release for the first time in a while. There is a lot of moving parts and you mentioned the hurricane impact. But just can you just talk about outlook or any credit normalization going forward in terms of also the mix and just amount of recovery that you are still being continuing to see on the commercial side? Tim Sloan : Yes, Ken, it's a really good question. I think that everybody in the industry and certainly been for us too, we've seen such a benign credit environment except for the energy business which we've all work through. Whether you are a 27 basis points or 30 or 33 whatever the number is over the last few quarter it's still really low. If you overlay the current economic environment we continue to believe that losses will probably bounce around at lower rate ex things like the impact from the hurricanes but overall the portfolio has never been in any better shape in my 30 years at the company so we continue to be optimistic. Sorry John -- John Shrewsberry : I think for us auto will look better because we've taken out the low end of credit quality. Tim Sloan : It's good point. John Shrewsberry : Vintages a recent quarterly, vintages of origination. I think with card we've been adding more new cards. We -- our card portfolio is now probably 50% what you consider to be very seasoned vintages so we should probably see a tick up because newer card vintages are going to experience front end loaded losses that's to be expected. Tim Sloan : But again that's not necessarily because of any fundamental deterioration at card portfolio, that's just a natural aging of new customers. Operator : Your next question comes from the lines of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Pleas go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. I had a couple of quick questions. One was on the hedge accounting treatment that you said you are going to adopt next quarter. Could you give us a sense to why you decided to adopt that? And could you also go through what do you think the impact is on balance sheet or you are going to be realizing any gains as you move over securities et cetera? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So this is -- this really relates to our own liabilities. When we issue long-term fixed rate either in dollars or in other currencies we hedge -- we often hedge back to floating, and we almost -- we generally hedge back to dollars or at least historically we did. So is that accounting noise that gets reduced as a result of the new accounting. So the only real impact that you are going to see is there will be some catch-up adjustment, year-to-date adjustment in Q4 which I think might amount to call it $100 million - $200 million kind of range. We haven't finished all the map on that yet but we'll figure out and that will come through in Q4. And then going forward what you see is a lot less volatility and the reason of course we are adopting it is because we are creating this noise in non-interest income that was bouncing around to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter that was just as a result of different evaluation schemes for the liability lag and the hedge lag and things that were permanently hedged. So we are happy with this kind of change. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And I heard in that there is one time opportunity to move some securities from held for -- held to maturity to AFS. I just wondering if you are going to take advantage of that at all or not? John Shrewsberry : Not going to. The impact for us is really on the liability side. Betsy Graseck : Okay, got it. And then question on the living will and living will have been extended right to next one is not for another was it 18 months or so. Just want to understand how you are thinking about that? Because I know we had a conversation before round how you are thinking about the size of the investment bank versus the living will and maybe you can give some updated thoughts on that. John Shrewsberry : Sure. So the MPOE strategy that we've had in our recently filings works great for us. And I point out that because it's more unique to us among the larger banks because we've got smaller non bank affiliate activity going on and that's sort of a key driver of whether that works or doesn't work. In order to create more flexibility going forward including more either size or complexity of some of our non bank affiliate activity with nothing in particular or urgent in mind but just in general. We get more flexibility with an SPOE strategy. We had to sort of finish the process first of satisfying the deficiencies that were called out a couple of years ago and then filing the most recent plan. And so we stuck to our plan and delivered that and the feedback thus far has been -- it's not complete but it has been fine. So by doing this we think we open up more flexibility for Wells Fargo going forward and as you mentioned the industry got word that there will be instead of an annual cycle, at least this time an extra year and so whether we wait and file at the end of that period or we file at the middle of that period, we haven't really figured out yet but the intention is to move towards SPOE and we thought that the investment community should know that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Just on auto specifically. I know you mentioned your actions you would be taking in the auto portfolio. What would drive you to get back into growth mode there? I know there has been some chatter around demand picking up and obviously the hurricane has had some impact. Tim Sloan : Yes. I just add I think there are two things going on, Betsy. One, there is the execution of the fundamental changes that we are making in the auto business to make it much more efficient and much more -- much less complex. And then it's just going to be our view of what's going on in the business. And if we think that there is more opportunity from a risk-reward standpoint as it relates to credit and we will take advantage of that but I think the decisions we've made over the last year had really worked because when you look at the average FICO scores of our customers, we did now increase and that's exactly what we wanted. So it's going to be a function of the changes that we are making in the business and then our view of what's going on in the industry. Even said all that I think you should expect that portfolio -- I am not being negative I just want to make sure you reinforce the comment I made to Ken, you should expect the portfolio even if we turn things up a notch to continue to decline through the fourth quarter this year through most of the next year and probably bottom out again sometime hopefully at the second half of next year. I mean we like that business. Don't get us wrong and our expectation is over time we will continue to gain share in that business but right now we are cautious and we got lot of changes going into the business and we got to execute those. John Shrewsberry : And those changes which we talked about are taking 50 or 55 distributed origination underwriting and collecting centers down to three bigger regional centers. And so while that's happening we rather have a higher credit profile the average customer so just that we are dealing with fewer defaults frankly while we make that change. And it will be made in 2018. Betsy Graseck : Right. And so that you get down to the 3 by the end of 2018 or is that 2019? John Shrewsberry : It's happening now; it should be by the end of 2018, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : And then just lastly on the reserve built for hurricanes $450 million is that right? John Shrewsberry : Yes. And it's not net build -- it's -- we would have it released but for the analysis that we've done so far on the hurricane impact areas. Betsy Graseck : Right. And is that -- it's a little figure that we've seen in other folks, can you just give us a sense of exposures or what's include in that? Is that across all credit spectrum, consumer and corporate? Is there anything that's really driving the bus on the size? Tim Sloan : Yes, it is. Betsy, again we are the largest lender in the country and you had a significant hurricanes have affected to very fast growing estate Texas and Florida in particular. John Shrewsberry : And Puerto Rico Tim Sloan : And Puerto Rico and so it's across all product types. But I would also put in the category of if it's early in our assessment and I think we've been appropriately prudent in wanting to be conservative. We could end up being a little bit too conservative, maybe a little bit less but right now because there is so much going on in all those markets we just thought it was prudent not to have a release until we get to the bottom or whatever the exposure would be. And our folks have been working very hard in terms of trying to get their arms around it and everyday is a little bit different. My guess we'll have updates throughout the quarter. John Shrewsberry : Yes. One of the first things we did in Texas and Florida was offer people a 90 day forbearance on their mortgage payment then add them on to the back end of the loan with no negative repercussions so they get just get their feet back on the ground. That's great thing although it is just complicate figuring out whose going to make their payments or not. So we have to wait I suppose just seeing all the information and every first of the month payment cycle. We also have more complications here with our borrower insurance whether it's auto insurance or homeowner insurance, how are they covered for flood, how are they covered for winds, those types of things which will -- which increases the uncertainty on what performance are going to be. So we noticed also that there was a bigger number than what some other people have talked about. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Hi, guys. I was wondering if you could spend just a moment or two talking about the branch footprint overall? I mean you guys definitely been more aggressive recently than you had been over say the last several years and sort of pairing back where appropriate but I guess increasingly I am finding myself getting questions about why your branch footprint shouldn't be like 1,000 or so branches, if you are just given how many more branches you have been -- the other biggest players in the country so just curious if you could maybe offer a little color on sort of how you are thinking about the appropriateness of the footprint as look you forward and what any additional opportunities might be? Tim Sloan : Sure. So Scott I think it's a great question but fundamentally I think every institutions going to have a different footprint. We are really, really proud of this footprint that we've developed over decades and decades which is one of the reasons why we have the largest market share from the deposit standpoint. That's incredibly valuable. And I'd also just caution that it's not just about the number of branches, it is the size of the branches, it's how they are organized, it's where they are located, which drive cost and so on. But I think Mary Mack was very clear in our Investor Day in giving a couple of years of guidance in terms of what are plans are and we are in the midst to executing on those plans. So far this year as we've detailed we are on track in terms of the branches we are closing. We haven't seen in any significant revenue impact which is part of the goal too. Most of our team members that were in those branches have now liked other branches which are absolutely terrific. So we've got an experienced crew. My guess is that over time we'll continue to respond to our customers because they are going to ultimately tell us how many branches they want. We transaction billions of dollars, billions of interactions each quarter but over 50 millions time a month somebody still comes into our branches and they want to be able to use them. So I think it's likely over time the number of branches that you see will decline. If our customers tell us that they want fewer of them then we will accelerate that. But candidly, if our customers tell us they want more we are going to listen to them. But I think you had also seen Scott the impact from the investment that we are making from the digital standpoint and it's not just the investment in terms of opening new accounts, it's also how we are integrating that into the branch experience. So it's long-winded answer to your question we are going to execute on what we said for 2018 and 2019. We are going to have an Investor Day next May. We will provide you with an update. I am sorry 2017 and 2018, we will have Investor Day next May, we will provide you with some updates and we will continue to move forward. John Shrewsberry : Only thing I'd is that we are thinking very, very aggressively about what the right mix is. We own half of our branches. We have short leases on most of the other half. We are in a position to be as flexible as we need to be if we think opportunity presents itself. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. Just wanted to -- sorry to everybody here but I just want to kick the dead horse on loan growth one more time. And I'll be quick on this one but the way we should think about with loan growth and the potential impact of the sales practice in card and auto insurance issues that if those issues did not happen at all. If you never had the sale practice issue emerge nor the auto insurance gap, CPI issue and all that. Loan growth headwind that you are seeing rights now, this decline in commercial et cetera that still would have happened? John Shrewsberry : For commercial John Pancari : Yes Tim Sloan : Yes. John, the sales practices impact for our loan growth has been primarily based on referrals from our branches to some of our other businesses. So there has been impact in terms of credit card referrals and first mortgage home equity and things like that. John Shrewsberry : Personal loans Tim Sloan : And personal and lines, thank you John. That's really where the impact has been. There has not been material impact in wholesale or wealth and investment management for that matter. John Pancari : Okay, thank you. And then a couple quick more things on the slide 16 where you give us the targeted savings exclude those items there including the CDI and the FDIC. What is the total of those items? Is it about a $1 billion? John Shrewsberry : On an annual basis it is about $1 billion, yes. John Pancari : Okay, all right, great. And then lastly on the credit side the 90 plus days past dues up 14% on a linked quarter basis. I am sorry if I missed this but how much of that is storm related and what is the amount that maybe related to the storms I guess and could that increase from here. Thanks. Tim Sloan : I don't have a good answer for you, John. I don't think much because it just happened and so I don't think that's a big driver. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Tim, so you have been CEO now for about a year Tim Sloan : A year and a day I think. Matt O'Connor: All right that even -- Tim Sloan : Maybe two I don't know, yes, seems like forever, Matt. Matt O'Connor: So now that you've been there for sometime do you feel like you have identified all the issues related to just call it sales practices and tactics have become headline issue for the stock and obviously weighted on results as well, issues like you have identified those issues. Tim Sloan : Well, Matt, we've been working very hard to identify all the issues. I am very pleased with the progress obviously, I am not necessarily pleased if you had find something, it sometimes it's not particularly positive but we've made a commitment to look through everything and be very disclosive and I appreciate that can create a headline. And weigh on the company and stock and team members and others stakeholders. But we've made a lot of progress. I can't commit to you Matt that we've finished everything because things are still in progress but we are very far along but I think it's also important to reinforce -- our review of all of our policies, procedures, practices is going to continue for a long time meaning that we got to continue to ask more of ourselves everyday. And I think that was in hindsight one of the mistakes that we made and we've -- I have taken responsibility for that, we've taken responsibility for it. But it's long-winded answer to your question, we are making a lot of progress. We've been transparent about everything that we've talked about, we discovered and so on. I am really pleased with the progress. Matt O'Connor: And if you had to guess I mean how much longer until you can say we've look through everything, this is what we found, we are done and I kind of appreciate that so issues can pop-up at any company at any time but when you kind of put the stake on the ground and say, we've been through everything, it's a big company, lots of businesses, lots of employees and we are moving forward and I kind of 100% guarantee nothing will pop up but like we are essentially on par with everybody else and we are feeling good from here. How long that is going to take? Tim Sloan : Well, Matt, I don't ever want to be on par with everybody else. I want to be better than everybody else. And that's why we rolled out our six aspirational goals for our team in March. And we said, look, we want to be the best in the industry. We are not in the best in the industry and everyone of those right now but that's what our goal is. So listen I appreciate the question and I understand the reason for the question and so on. But I don't have a specific date and I think it's a mistake notwithstanding in the short term that might feel good but in long term it would be a mistake, it's a mistake to put a stake in the ground, and say everything is got to be done by certain day because then what happen is people might rush to get to an answer and I don't want them to rush to the answer. I want them to get to the right answer. But again we've made a lot of progress. As John described, we are spending a lot of money looking through everything and building a better company. So we are going to continue on that journey. Matt O'Connor: Okay. I can appreciate it's hard to put a timeframe on it but I do think it's important to come out when you feel confident and say that these legacy issues have been addressed, we are turning the page and we are moving on. Tim Sloan : Understood. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks for taking the question. Hey, what I want to focus on is your deposit beta has been higher than the peer which is a normal compared to your history. And that is really been I think reflective of you wanting to especially with corporate and wealth management customers not giving any other reasons in this period to work anywhere else. So you have been defensive in your deposit pricing which is not been the case in the past you have been much more offensive and aggressive being able to hold back those deposits. When you look at your assets structure because of the duration that would have had you to assume on your deposit side over time, you would have extended your asset. So what you are kind of getting is a fundamental shift into deposit beta which doesn\u2019t reflect on your asset side so you got almost a mismatch and I am just wondering if that's the way to kind of think about this and is this how and why we are not seeing the margin expansion that we are seeing in some other banks. John Shrewsberry : The aggregate deposit beta is a function of the component pieces of it. And as I mentioned earlier we are the number one retail deposit franchise and beta there is essentially zero. And in wealth and investment management where we've got a sophisticated clientele with lot of excess liquidity and lot of options, I think our beta -- our realized beta has been on the order of a third -- 30% to 35%. In the wholesale where we as you point out we have lots of sophistication, lots of competition et cetera, I think the realized beta has been something on the order of two thirds and so to the extent that we've been growing wholesale deposits a little bit faster than the weighted average deposit beta moves up reflecting that mix. I don't know whether Perry would say that he is being responsive in this cycle to give not give people a reason to move money away from Wells Fargo. I think they are being judicious; they are going customer by customer or customer category by customer category. We are doing more for example with certain type of institutional borrowers which probably have the most sensitivity to change in rate but we need them for our total liquidity profile and it sort of is what it is on average. And when I think about NIM expansion and the rising rate environment, obviously this is a big part of the outcome but it's also the change in rest of our liability structure as well, we've got more long -term debt than we've ever had before that comes in more of cost which has been NIM depressing during the time that we've been adding an office, this few other structural items as well. Tim Sloan : Marty, let me just reinforce how we think about pricing, deposits for our wholesale customers. It's very much based -- very much done on a relationship by relationship basis. So it's not just about hey let's decide whether or not we want to keep these deposits, it's about what's the value of the overall relationship. And so it's as you appreciated it's a little bit more complicated than just the deposit. It's the relationship and it's very much coordinated with what we are doing on the wealth and the individual side. So there is a lot of coordination going on, if there has as John mentioned the beta is a little bit higher but I wouldn't necessary jump to the conclusion that's fundamentally changed the structure at the company. Marty Mosby : Now I thinking that might be temporary in the sense that you used to be able to most aggressive lagger which helped you to be able to expand when everybody else was expanding but also maintain a higher margin because you had extended the duration on your assets prudently so that defended your margin in a decline rate environment but takes away a little bit of the punch in the way up that you used to be able to make by just being half of what everybody else did in deposit increases. Then my last question was if you look at fee income, you've seen disruption of activities related to these hurricanes and other things that have go on in the last couple of months. Do you feel like -- we've seen what you have allocated on the loan loss reserve, but hasn't it also probably impacted some of your fee income in the third quarter. Tim Sloan : Oh I think at the margin, Marty, there is no question when you have such an important market like Florida without power and still parts of Florida without power, you have an important market like in and around Houston which has been like very dynamic from a growth standpoint, there are some impact. I don't know how much it is but at the margin there is some impact and we'll work through, that has an impact to the company in a very short term, over the long terms those are great markets, they are going to recover. Generally, what you see kind of post hurricane, in a hurricane situation you see kind of V shape recovery in those markets and we are looking forward to that. That's one of the reasons why we've really focused on making sure that we provided all the benefits to our customers possible to help them recover even faster. Marty Mosby : No, I think that's right. And this was say it's kind of hidden impact there was no way to put your finger on but it is kind of underneath a numbers as you kind of look at and it will rebound quickly but thanks. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Tim. Good, thank you. Can you guys give us some color -- obviously, you're leading mortgage originator in the United States, leading mortgage originator. And can you give us some color on where you see the housing industry at this point in the cycle? Are we halfway through the cycle? 2/3 the way through? We're just turning out? Any color would be helpful. Tim Sloan : Yes, I mean everybody has got an opinion on this. I wish Franklin on the phone because he'd probably give you the best one but my personal view is that I think this recovery is very different than what we've seen historically because of the impacts of demographics and what we just see the millennials forming households and therefore buying houses at a different pace than what we saw in earlier recovery and/or prior recoveries in other demographics. So I think there is -- and we believe there is a lot more room to grow. I don't know what inning it's in but I would say its -- again assuming kind of the steady economic growth that we've seen, we see that demographic grew aging more, they are starting to form families more, we are starting to -- and we are starting to see the benefit of that. So my expectation is that we are early in that process and we got lot to look forward to. And that's one of the reasons why we have been so focused on rolling out our new digital mortgage application because I think particularly for that demographic group, they are used to a mortgage and then they want a mortgage experience and maybe you and I didn't experience when we bought our first home. They are used to --when they go online they want all the information as they should have and so that's why we are excited to roll this out in the first quarter and we think that will be very positive to that demographic group. Gerard Cassidy : In that application you've described, Tim, that's equivalent to the rocket mortgage that Quicken loans has right now? Tim Sloan : I want to be respectful to the Quicken, I think they've done a great job with rocket mortgage but I would describe what we are doing as the kind of the next generation because it's not just about giving a fast answer. That's part of it. Everybody expects that and we are doing that across the platform from a consumer side. This is about if you are going online, you are Wells Fargo customer, you type in a little bit information like who you are and you want to mortgage and we pre populate your application so that you are not -- we are not asking you and you are not having to give for the 44 time where you live, how much you make and it's using the trusted data that we have here. What's even more exciting about that is that we are going to have the capability of pulling that data from outside Wells Fargo too. So we are going to have that same capability both inside and outside of Wells Fargo. So I would describe that is a next generation. John Shrewsberry : So I mentioned in my comments earlier that data modernization is one of our big initiatives because for reasons like this with the breadth of reach that we have to call it 21 million households and 70 million customers in one way or another, we know so much about our customers that we should be able to as in this case pre populate with trusted data, but present really customized, really personalized solution when people are looking for a new product or new service. We can use that same data in a fraud protection way, it's very, very, powerful and a risk management way, it's very, very powerful. The more we know because of the breadth of our relationship with customers, the stronger the value proposition is going forward. So it's a huge initiative and it's going to -- it should change the way retail banking is done. Gerard Cassidy : I see. And maybe Tim, sticking with home mortgage for a moment, I think, very recently, the mortgage bankers association came up with the top 20 originators. And what's fascinating is the top 10, the number of non-banks that are in there, like the Quicken loans or Freedom Mortgage Corp., and they're growing very rapidly. How do you see them as a competitive threat to the traditional banks like your own? Tim Sloan : Well, I think the primary driver for the change in mix in the top 10 has been related to FHA direct mortgages again set correspondent aside for a minute. Because the FHA has not adopted the same liability structure that Fannie and Freddie have. The larger originators we would be one and our other bank competitors or the other have just said you know what we are not going to sign up for the fact that 10 years from now somebody could come back and say I mortgage the originated today defaulted at that point in time. That's really been the driver. Now I am hopeful that with all the changes we are going to incur as we look at how homes are financed in this country that issue will be dealt with and I can assure you that if and when that occurs we will back into FHA direct business and you will see an improvement in our share over time. But that's been the driver. Plain and simple. And I don't mean to be negative about any other competitors. They are all terrific and I am sure they are providing good service and so on to their customers but that's been the driver. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then with home equity loans, I think you mentioned, if I heard you correctly a moment ago, that you could see growth in the product in 2018, but the vintage home equity loans are performing much better than your earlier thought. Is there any possibility that, that type of product whether it was an interest only product for a 10-year term, would those come back when you think about growing the portfolio since they performed so much better than expected. Tim Sloan : There is no question that we want to try to retain as many of those customers as we can. So the short answer is yes, I think that's part of our overall growth strategy but many of those are just paying off because the customers don't need them any more. Gerard Cassidy : I see. And then just lastly, you guys talked about your expense initiative, of course, and it's $4 billion that you're going to reduce, I think you, John, pretty clear, that the expectations for the reduction in expenses do not include the core deposit premiums that you've been running every year, also the FDIC special assessment and then also expenses associated with businesses that you sold of. Can you frame up for us what that total could be from those 3 areas and that it will be on top of the $4 billion? Tim Sloan : Yes, I think Betsy had asked about the sum of the FDIC premium and the amortization of deposits intangible. That's about $1 billion a year in full run rate. And the expenses from the businesses that we are selling, I don't think that we have called that out one yet, it's less than $1 billion but there is a portion of that's direct and a portion indirect and so we need to make sure that we can drive out all of the indirect that's associated with it in order to take the full amount out. We will get some more clarity as those businesses actually close and are sold. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Let's get the deal and then we will provide some more detail. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning, everybody. Two questions. First, client customer growth, your primary checking account customers have essentially been flat over the last year, that compares to sort of mid to high single digit historically and it's really decelerated since second quarter of last year. And on top of that small business account deposit and consumer deposits have been come in as well. So I mean how important is it to stem that and start to drive some consumer account growth and what you need to do to kick start that? Is it at some point does it suggest that maybe you do have to start to become a little bit more aggressive in terms of deposit pricing on the retail side as well? Tim Sloan : So let me answer the last question, last part of your question and get to the beginning because it's a really good question. The short answer is no. We don't -- that the driver this is not deposits pricing. I think that at the margin if you are competing on price, you are making short term decision and invest in the opportunity to build long term relationships. What -- how I would think about the primary checking account growth in kind of two parts. One is quality and one is quantity. You are talking about quantity which is an absolute fair point year-over-year it's been flat. I think the reason for that is because we've been through and are going through a transformation in our retail business. And when you think about what -- how that sales practices settlement and related reputational impact affected our team and our customers particularly in the third and the fourth quarter, and then Mary and team have been making fundamental changes to the business in terms of a new incentive plan, going through reducing a layer of management in terms of new training and just there has been so much going on. And I think that what we are seeing and actually I was talking to Mary about this over the last couple of days. What we are seeing right now in our branches our team members that are so much more confident and working so much better with their customers to provide them with solutions and I think you are going to see that in not only continued improvement in customer experience and loyalty scores but you are going to see that in terms of growth. The quality I think is an important point. Mary highlighted at Investor Day that average customer deposits per account were up about 8% year-over-year, now we are seeing that be up about 11%. So we've got work to do on quantity, quality is already improving but it's just the execution of all the plans that are in the process right now. And we are seeing improvement everyday. Saul Martinez : Okay. No, that's helpful. I guess a follow up with sort of a bigger picture type of question and you guys have lot of stakeholders as any banker any company, employees, the community, you serve your client, your shareholders, you obviously want to be seen as good corporate citizen whose actions are doing good for society at large. But sort of in the grand scheme of things I mean how important is generating an 11% to 13% ROE for shareholders. And the question isn't meant to be confrontational or grandstanding in anyways but it does feel like it sort in the background of discussions you have with investors as well going to pull the cost leverage harder as they can or they going to communicate that or they are going to be more up to change pricing or increase deposit pricing or whatever it is. But I kind of wanted to just ask sort of how do you think about the push and pull of how you run the business and decide how to address different stakeholders' interest? Tim Sloan : Yes. I will start and then I am sure John want to jump in but look we appreciate that we have lot of stakeholders. And it is not lost on us, that one of our most important stakeholders are you; our shareholders and we have historically provided exceptional returns on an absolute and relative basis. I think our returns are continued to be very, very good. Others have caught up, we appreciate that but make no mistake, we understand that increasing our capital return to our shareholders like we did this quarter where we were up to $4 billion and continuing to grow ROE is very important. And that's one of the reasons why when we introduced our six aspirational goals to our team that we were very clear that providing the best long-term returns to our shareholders and the industry is one of our goals. And we are going to achieve that goal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi, John. Just a couple of questions, mortgage application issue that came out you said you are refunding customer from September 2016. Just want to understand does something changed in the system that caused this thing to start from September 2016? Any color on that what happened that it starts on that point? John Shrewsberry : Sure. So prior to 2013, we were in the midst of refinancing boom and everybody was so busy, everybody in the industry but we certainly were that we didn't charge for any sort of rate lock extension. We put a new policy and practice in place at that point which was in place until we changed it. So it's that roughly three year timeframe that we are focused on where some customers where we charged a rate lock extension maybe should have been -- it should have been handled differently and that's population that we were focused on. We changed our practice, it's done centrally now and so that's there is a focus. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And so I guess brings a bigger picture question. So with all these kind of little, little things that have come up which not always easy to find, is that something you are trying to do to I mean it is a big bank in terms of processes so that you can catch more of these, Tim? Tim Sloan : Oh, absolutely. I think that's really been fundamental to the changes that we've been executing on in the last year. We are very clear about the fact that one of the reasons that we had some issues in our retail banking business is because of how we were organized. So we've centralized all of our control functions whether its compliance or HR, finance, you name it. And so we've got a better check in balance than we did before. That's number one. Two, we've been very focused on reinforcing to the entire team that if there is something they are concerned about, go ahead and raise your hand and escalate it and so that's working too. And then within our centralized risk functions we are also -- we've also created a conduct office and within that we are assembling data to John's point about the investment we are making at data. So that we are using data better to triangulate into any area that we are concerned about. You take call to an FX line or attrition or complaints or whatever, you put that altogether and then you can more quickly look at something and say, hey, we got an issue, we don't. The good news is we are making lots of progress but absolutely right. I mean we have fundamentally changed this organization. We fundamentally changed it for the better and we are seeing that everyday. Now, sometimes in seeing that it means that we find something. We are going to be very transparent about it because that's what we promised you to do. Vivek Juneja : So even things like product pricing, Tim? Product pricing - Tim Sloan : Yes, oh sure. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Different question. John, you mentioned something about spending on BSA AML; I haven't heard that from you before. Something new I mean is there an order or event or something that caused you to mention that or any color on that? John Shrewsberry : Nothing new. There has been an order in place for sometime which just raises the standard for the level of borrower due diligence if necessary in order to be satisfying from a regulatory perspective. So there is a lot of beneficial owner or if there is a lot of sort of incremental memo writing, file cracking et cetera across hundreds and hundreds of thousands of wholesale customers. And it cost at the margin hundreds and millions of dollars per year to accomplish. That sort of a backlog issue. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And when do you expect you might be able to get out of this consent order? John Shrewsberry : Well, I think the expectation is that the work necessary to deliver would be done -- finished in 2018. It has been underway for more than a year. That's a different question as to getting under the consent order. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi, good morning. So yes two quick questions I think. When you look at the C&I growth, I know it's down, I know you highlighted some of the decline and some of -- what was offset by growth in the presentation but that still only accounts for $1 billion of the $3 billion decline. So can you just highlight where the rest of the decline came from? And in light of some of your peers were reporting strong growth in large corporate banking, how would that large corporate banking perform on a quarter? Tim Sloan : Large corporate was down, I don't have the specific number in front of me but it was down a bit. I would say was probably in line with what I have seen from some of our competitors. It was just a little bit decline or low in some of the larger transactional activity. But we called out these specific areas that were the primary drivers. Everything else was relatively small and we also called out the impact in terms of the commercial real estate. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then on the facility ratio for 2018, I know you hear -- you have been saying that your whole to lending growth picks up and that you are optimistic it will but being what kind of lending growth is in the budget for you hit that 59%? I mean can you just still hit the 59% goal with 1% loan growth or 2% loan growth? Tim Sloan : We haven't exactly send a budget for next year yet but look our assumption is that we are going -- and belief is that we are going to be able to grow our commercial loans as we have year-over-year-over-year, I mean we had some impact us so far in the last couple of quarters. But I wouldn't describe that as the primary driver for what's going to happen from the efficiency standpoint because we've got a consumer loan portfolio and we've got revenues coming from our fees and like. So it's a little bit more complicated than that in terms of the driver or the efficiency. But again our goal is to get down to a 59% level sometime next year. So I am sure we'll be talking about that again. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Listen, I really appreciate everybody's time this morning. I know it's been a busy morning for all of you. Just want to reemphasis that over the past years we've made a number of fundamental changes to our business model, to structure the organization which I was just mentioning and to a number of our performance management programs to ensure that we are focusing on our customers and focusing on their financial needs. Again, I want to thank the hard work and effort of our 268,000 team members for their focus and resiliency in meeting those customers' need. We are seeking every opportunity to identify and fix any issues that we have with the company. And make sure they are done correctly. As I mentioned, we've seen a very strong progress in addressing those issues and also rebuilding trust with all of stakeholders including all of you. And while we understand there is more work to do, I am confident that we are absolutely on the right path as we continue to build a better, stronger Wells Fargo. So again thank you very much for your time. Have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. And you may now disconnect.",

Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn our call over to CEO and President, Tim Sloan. Tim Sloan : Thank you, John. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2017 was a transformational year for Wells Fargo as we made significant progress on our efforts to build a better bank. Our vision of satisfying our customers' financial needs remains unchanged, but how we execute this vision has evolved.  This evolution includes develop new ways to more efficiently serve our customers and create a better customer experience, which includes investments in innovation, streamlining and centralizing processes in organization structures, strengthening the foundations of the way we manage risk and building a robust and more modern data and technology infrastructure.  Pages we supplement highlight the few of the actions we taken at Wells Fargo better for our customers, our team members, our shareholder and our communities. Some with our customers in order to help those impacted by hurricanes last year we provide a payment relief and proactively way -- to approximately 100,000 customers. We've also made a number of customer friendly changes to help all of our customers to better manage their accounts. For example, in March we introduced Automatic zero balance alerts and we now send over 18 million real time alerts a month, enabling our customers to make a deposit or a transfer so they don't overdraw their account.  In November, we introduced Overdraft Rewind, which has already helped over 350,000 customers avoid overdraft charges. We believe that using data and technology to help our customers better manage their finances will enable us to grow and build more long-term relationships.  In 2017, we accelerated the pace of innovation and launched value added technologies, including card-free ATM access, which our customers have used more than 5 million times since March. And since June, our customers have sent more than $10 billion through Zelle for P2P payments. As our customers have increased their use of online and mobile channels, we've made it easier for them to interact with us digitally. For example, digital credit card account openings were up 47% from a year ago. In November, we launched Intuitive Investor, our digital brokerage advisory offering, and later this quarter we will fully rollout our digital mortgage application, which combines the power of Wells Fargo Data with a You Know Me customer experience.  In 2018, we expect additional innovations including instant issuance of debit cards to customers in mobile wallets and control tower, a central hub for customers to view and manage the places where their Wells Fargo cards and account information is stored.  In addition to these innovations, we rely on our team members to help drive an exceptional customer experience and in 2017 we took a number of steps to enhance team member benefits, including adding four additional paid holidays, announcing plans to grant restricted stock rights to approximately 250,000 team members, and increasing the minimum base pay for all U.S. based team members. We increased the minimum hourly rate, to $13.50 in 2017 which impacted 31,000 team members. After the passage of the tax cuts and Job Act, we announced another increase to $15 an hour starting in March 2018 and we are also reviewing team members, who were already making $15 an hour or slightly above to ensure that they are paid appropriately based on their role. We estimate that approximately 70,000 team members will receive a pay increase related to these changes.  Our goal is to deliver long-term value for our shareholders through a balanced business model, strong risk discipline, efficient execution and a world-class team. In 2017, we generated $22.2 billion of net income, with an 11.35% return on equity. From that, we've returned $14.5 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. This is up 16% from 2016. Returning more capital to our shareholders remains a top priority.  Another goal is to make positive contributions to the communities we serve. And in 2017, we donated $286 million including more than $4 million to areas that were impacted by Hurricanes, California wildfires and other natural disasters. We also announced that we are targeting $400 million in donations to non-profits and community organizations in 2018, an increase of approximately 40% from last year. And beginning in 2019, we are targeting 2% of our after-tax net profits for corporate philanthropy.  Our results in the fourth quarter were strong and they included a net benefit from the tax cuts and Job Act. While it's too early to determine the full impact, it appears that tax reform will benefit our customers and help grow the U.S. economy and surveys indicate business confidence has increased. Other items that impacted our results in the fourth quarter included, the gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, and higher litigation accruals.  Our efforts to transform Wells Fargo were evident in our results in 2017, including record deposit balances, improved retail banking household retention, increased brand satisfaction with most recent visit scores, which are now back to the levels we had prior to the sales practice settlements, growth in debit card and credit card purchase volume, both up 6% in the fourth quarter from a year ago, record levels of client assets in wealth and investment management, historically low credit losses, exceptionally strong capital and liquidity levels. And while our expenses increased driven by higher litigation accruals and investments in our businesses and capabilities, we are on track with our expense initiatives and we remain committed to our target of $4 billion in expense reductions. John will provide more details on this later in the call. In summary, Wells Fargo is a much better company today than we were a year ago. And notwithstanding our challenges, I am confident that the hard work, dedication and resiliency of our team members demonstrated throughout 2017 will make Wells Fargo even better in 2018 as we continue our transformation.  John will now discuss our financial results in more detail. John Shrewsberry : Thanks, Tim. And good morning, everyone. We are earned $6.2 billion or $1.16 per share in the fourth quarter. And as Tim mentioned our results included three noteworthy items I will describe in a minute. First, I want to quickly highlight the impact from our election to early adopt the new hedge accounting standard which was mentioned on the call last quarter and was discussed in our third quarter 10-Q filing. It\u2019s described in a note on slides that highlights, slide 4. As a result of this early adoption, our previously reported EPS for prior quarters in 2017 was revised resulting in a net $0.03 per share increase in EPS for the first nine months of the year. We have more information on this accounting standard in the appendix.  On page 5, we summarize the noteworthy items which included a $3.35 billion after-tax benefit or $0.67 per share from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I will be providing more details about this on the next page. Our results also include an $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services which benefited EPS by $0.11, and we had a $3.25 billion litigation accrual in the quarter for a variety of matters including mortgage related regulatory investigations, sales practices and other consumer related matters. The majority of this expense was not tax deductible and it reduced EPS by $0.59. On page 6, we provide more details on the impacts of the Tax Act. The estimated tax benefit from the reduction to net deferred income taxes was $3.89 billion, was somewhat unique in that the tax effective, our temporary difference results in a net deferred tax liability which is primarily driven by differences between the book and tax treatment of our leasing and mortgage servicing businesses and mark-to-market timing differences.  In addition, we\u2019ve not had big historic net operating losses which are now less valuable under the Tax Act and we earn substantially all of our income in the US, so we have lower amounts of foreign cash subject to deemed repatriation. This benefit was partially offset by a $370 million after-tax loss from valuation adjustments related to leverage leases, low income housing and tax advantage renewable energy investments.  In addition, there was a $173 million tax expense from the estimated deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. We currently expect our full year 2018 effective income tax rate to be approximately 19%.  And we\u2019ll highlight much of what\u2019s on page 7 later on the call. So, let me just point out on the asset side, we purchased $20.9 billion of securities in the fourth quarter which were largely offset by one-off and sales.  On the liability side, our long-term debt balances declined $14.2 billion primarily driven by lower federal home loan bank debt.  I'll be highlighting our income statement drivers on page 8 later on the call. So, turning to page9. Average loans declined $521 million from the third quarter with commercial loans down $692 million partially offset by a $171 million of higher average consumer loans. However, we did have some positive momentum in our loan growth during the quarter with period end loans up $4.9 billion from the third quarter.  Let me highlight the drivers starting on page 10. Commercial loans increased $3.2 billion from the third quarter, with C&I loans up $5.2 billion. C&I growth was broad based and included seasonal growth in financial institutions and commercial distribution finance as well as growth in asset backed finance and corporate banking. Commercial real estate loans declined $2.1 billion from the third quarter, reflecting our continued credit discipline in a very competitive market.  Consumer loans grew $1.7 billion from the third quarter, similar the trends we've highlighted throughout the year. We had growth in first mortgage loans and credit card balances and declines in junior lean mortgages auto and other revolving and installment loans. As a reminder, growth in the first quarter will be impacted by seasonally lower mortgage origination and credit card balances. Auto originations were relatively flat linked quarter and were down 33% from a year ago. We've reduced volumes while strengthening the credit profile of this portfolio and our origination volume with the FICO score above 640 grew to 85% of total originations in the fourth quarter, up from 76% a year ago. We expect balances will continue to decline throughout 2018 given the transformational changes we're making in the business.  Our deposits reached a record high in the fourth quarter and our average deposits increased 2% from the year ago. Our average deposit cost increased 2 basis points from the third quarter and was up 16 basis points from a year ago. The market hasn't made changes to the rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits and neither have we. As Fed funds and LIBOR have increased we've had incremental deposit repricing for commercial and wealth and management customers. If the tax act drives stronger, industry loan growth this year, deposit betas could be impacted somewhat as market demand for deposits increases to fund this growth.  Our full year 2017 net interest income increased 4% consisting with the expectation we provided at Investor Day. Net interest income in the fourth quarter declined to $136 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by the $183 million reduction to net interest income from adjustments related to leverage leases due to the tax act, which reduced loan yields in the quarter. Similarly, our NIM was down 2 basis points to 284 as the negative impacts from the adjustment related to leverage leases and growth in average deposits was partially offset by lower average long-term debt and a modest benefit from all other growth repricing and variable terms.  Investors often ask us about our loan swaps. So, let me provide some additional details on our position. As we previously disclosed between 2014 and 2016, we entered into received fixed rate swaps to hedge some of our LIBOR based commercial loans when the expectation was the interest rates to be lower for longer. We converted lower yielding floating rate loans into higher yielding fixed rate loans. At the peak, we had $86 million worth of loan swaps. We actively manage these positions as starting in the third quarter, we began to unwind some of them. At year-end, we had $51 million of notional outstanding, and we've unwound more early this year leaving us with that current notional value of closer to $30 million. The reduction in swaps will reduce interest income from these loans in 2018, but it's increased our interest rate sensitivity from the low end, back to near the midpoint of our range of 5 to 15 basis points for a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve.  Being modestly more asset sensitive at this point in the rate cycle should be beneficial. However, it's important to note, that during the extended period of loan interest rates since these swaps we're entered into they generated incremental revenue of approximately $3 billion for Wells Fargo. The cost of unwinding the swaps which is approximately $700 million will be amortized over the remaining life of the original derivative which averages approximately 3 years.  Our net interest income for full year 2018 will be dependent on a variety of factors including the level and of slope of the yield curve as well as deposit betas and earning asset growth trends.  Non-interest income grew $337 million from the third quarter. This increase included the benefit of the $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which was partially offset by a $414 million reduction from impairments on low income housing and renewable energy investments resulting from the tax act. Deposit service charges declined $30 million from the third quarter, driven by customer friendly changes including the launch of Overdraft Rewind in November which Tim highlighted at the start of the call.  Trust and investment fees increased $78 million on higher asset base fees and retail brokerage transaction activity. Mortgage banking non-interest income declined $118 million from the third quarter, largely due to a $71 million decline in residential mortgage origination revenue, driven by a 10% reduction in origination volumes primarily from seasonality in the purchase market. The gain on sale margin in the fourth quarter was 125 basis points relatively flat from the third quarter, and based on current pricing trends and channel mix in our held-for-sale pipeline we expect the margin to decline in the first quarter.  Servicing income declined $47 million, primarily from lower net hedge results due to the impact of changes in MSR valuation assumptions, including the impact of increasingly competitive industry pricing, lower carry on our MSR hedge in the flatter yield curve environment and increased customer payment deferrals in areas impacted by recent hurricanes. On page 15, we provide details on our trading related revenue, which declined $49 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by declines in customer trading activity from lower volatility and compressed spreads.  Turning to expenses on page 16. Expenses increased $2.4 billion from the third quarter largely driven by the $2.2 billion higher operating losses. On page 17, I'll highlight the other drivers of the increase.  The $142 million increase from the third quarter in compensation and benefits expense reflected higher stock award expense, primarily from stock price and performance impacts on prior period awards. Higher salaries expense was largely driven by higher costs from the additional paid holidays we granted our team members in 2017. Increases in running the business discretionary and infrastructure cost were driven by typically higher advertising and equipment spending in the quarter.  On page 18, we showed the drivers of the year-over-year increase in expenses, which was also primarily driven by higher operating losses. Compensation and benefits expense increased $475 million, primarily due to annual salary adjustments and higher benefit costs which were partially offset by lower FTE. Our FTE were down 2% from the year ago reflecting the sale of our insurance services business as well as declines in consumer lending and community banking. Higher compensation and benefits expense also reflected $115 million of higher deferred comp expense which is P&L neutral.  On page 19, we highlight the progress we made in 2017 on our expense initiatives which was primarily driven by the efforts we\u2019ve made through centralization and optimization. We centralized enterprise functions that were previously distributed across our organization.  In addition, we realigned businesses to eliminate redundancy and leverage customer synergies and we\u2019ve continued to make transformational changes for our operating models including in-contact centers, technology and operations.  We also saved money through continued improvement in vendor leverage in contract pricing. We have done this by using our centralized contract team to negotiate rates based on the aggregated volume of the entire company. We reduced travel and entertainment expense by 2% by enhancing our travel policy standards and leveraging technology. We also exceeded our target of 200 branch closures in 2017 and to date, the closures have had minimal impact on household retention and growth. Based on customer channel usage, we currently expect to close 250 branches or more in 2018. Branches play an important part in serving our customers and we will have as many branches as our customers want for as long as they want them. Based on our current assumptions regarding consumer channel behavior and our own technology advances as well as other factors, we can see our total branch network declining to approximately 5,000 by the end of 2020.  We are also reducing properties and other businesses including standalone mortgage locations which stand [ph] by over 10% in 2017. We are also transitioning operational activities in our auto business from 57 regional banking centers into three larger regional sites.  We expect to complete the consolidation in the first half of 2018 helping us further standardize process in the business. As we pursue these reductions, we will continue to support team members by helping them find other positions while we also consider the banking needs of the communities we serve. We are on track to achieve our targeted $4 billion of expense reductions which have been identified and assigned to the business leaders who have specific responsibility for achieving them. As a reminder the first $2 billion of targeted expense saves by year end 2018 supports our ongoing investment in the businesses which includes a number of key areas such as enhancing our compliance and risk management capability, building a better bank and strengthening our core infrastructure.  We expect the additional $2 billion targeted annual expense reductions by the end of 2019 to go to the bottom line and be fully recognized in 2020. These expected savings do not include the completion of core deposit intangible amortization expense at the end of this year which will amount to $769 million in full year 2018 and also it doesn\u2019t include the completion of the FDIC special assessment which we expect should happen by the end of 2018.  Finally, it doesn\u2019t include expense savings due to business divestitures which we highlight on page 22. As part of our efforts to be more transparent in response to investor request, we are providing more detail on our expense expectations for 2018 on page 21. We currently expect that full year 2018 total expenses to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion. This expectation includes approximately $600 million of typical operating losses this year and excludes any outside litigation and remediation accruals or penalties.  As I mentioned on the call last quarter we expect to achieve a quarterly efficiency ratio with a 59 handle by the end of 2018, not including any outside litigation accruals.  2018 revenue which will impact the efficiency ratio will be influenced by a number of factors including the absolute level of rates, the shape of the yield curve, loan growth, deposit betas, credit spreads, cash redeployment and the absolute level of the equity markets. And just as a point of reference, we estimate our efficiency ratio sensitivity to be plus or minus 60 basis points for every 1% increase or decrease in revenue from the $88.4 billion we earned in 2017. We will provide guidance on the expenses for 2019 in our Investor Day in May.  For the past couple of years, we\u2019ve been taking a hard look at all of our businesses and their contributions and as a result we\u2019ve had multiple divestitures, we thought it will be helpful to share the revenue and direct expense associated with the businesses we sold over the past two years, which we provide on page 22. As you can see there was a revenue impact from selling these businesses but they were sold for sound economic reasons and generated nice returns for our shareholders. As a reminder, Wells Fargo Insurance Services was sold at the end of November and the share owner services is expected to close later in the first quarter. Turning to our segment starting on slide 23. The majority of the impacts from the tax act as well as the litigation accruals in the quarter were included in our community banking results.  On page 24, we highlight the customers continue to actively used their accounts, we have strong growth and digital secure sessions up 8% from a year ago and we continue to have declines in branch and ATM interactions reflecting the increased use of digital channels by our customers.  On page 25, we highlight balance and activity growth which included an increase of 6% in both credit and debit card purchase volume from a year ago. As Tim mentioned, branch satisfaction with most recent visit scores are now back to the levels we had prior to the sales practice settlements. I believe the transformational changes we\u2019re making to better meet our customers financial needs including providing bankers with innovative tools to enable more meaningful financial conversations with our customers not only improves customer service, but will also drive growth.  Turning to page 26. Wholesale banking results in the fourth quarter included the gain on the sale of our insurance services business. Total wealth and investment management client assets reached a record high of $1.9 trillion, and average closed referral investment assets were up 12% from a year ago.  Turning to page 28. Our credit quality remained exceptionally strong, our loss rate for the full year was among the lowest in our history and in the fourth quarter our loss rate was 31 basis points of average loans. All of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position in the quarter including our home equity portfolio. Non-performing assets have declined for seven consecutive quarters and were less than 1% of total loans for the second consecutive quarter. Continued improvement in the oil and gas portfolio have benefited this trend.  During the oil and gas cycle over the last three years, we established a peak oil and gas reserve of $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016 and incurred through the cycle losses of $1.2 billion. We believe we\u2019ve largely put this issue behind us and we\u2019ll no longer provide credit updates on this portfolio in future quarters unless factors change, but we will continue to include the size of the portfolio in our 10-Q, filings. We had a $100 million reserve release in the quarter reflecting continued strong credit performance.  Turning to page 29, our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased in increased to 11.9% in the fourth quarter remaining well above our internal target level of 10%. We remain focused on returning more capital to shareholders and we turn to record $14.5 billion through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in 2017, up 16% from 2016. We had net share repurchases of $6.8 billion in 2017, up 42% from 2016, and period end common shares outstanding declined 2% to 4.9 billion shares. In summary, we began 2018 with an exceptionally strong asset quality, liquidity and capital. We're on track to achieve our expense targets and the transformational changes we're making throughout Wells Fargo will help us achieve our six goals and drive our long-term success.  We'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : So, I expect you to differ me to Investor Day, but I'm going to try anyway. I'm sure that your investors are going to refine your 2019 and 2020 outlook for the company following your results. And if you think about your new guidance for dollar expenses in 2018 and again fully acknowledging that you will get more color in May, is it fair to take that $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion range, assume a growth rate, and this is for 2020, assuming normal growth rate over the next two years and then take out the $2 billion in cost savings, the $769 million in CDI expense and the $573 million in sold business expense, isn't included? Tim Sloan : Yeah. Erika, I think that's a fair description of what could happen. I think one of the big impacts to that could be what revenues look like in 2020, but I think that's fair. John Shrewsberry : The one thing I'd add that will be, we've been talking about, we'll talk about more at Investor Day as you mentioned, is the arc of the ongoing reinvestment or investment in the various programs that we have to transform Wells Fargo. Some of them are regulatory in nature, some of them are [probation] in nature, but there are variety of them, each of them has their own arc. They're in place today and so how they come off the total is going to be the missing link for what happens in 2019 and maybe even in 2020 for some of them. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow up question is on the consumer loan side, it was up $1.7 billion on a linked quarter basis. Two of your peers are more relatively upbeat in terms of the consumer outlook for 2018 especially relative to tax reform. And the question for you is, has the attrition in the consumer book bottomed in 2017?  And on the mortgage side as you think about non-conforming loan growth and loan originations, is there still a gap between what your underwriting standards are today and what you think they could go down to if we had better guidance or reformed guidance from the agencies on mortgage? Tim Sloan : So, Erika good question. I think let me respond in a couple of ways. First, I think it's absolutely fair and the feedback that we've been getting from our customers is that we should all be cautiously optimistic on the impact of the tax reform act on consumers. There have been millions of employed folks across the country that have gotten pay races and bonuses and the like, and I think that\u2019s a net positive for economic growth. As it relates to cyclically to our consumer loan growth, we believe that we will grow mortgage loans this year. We believe that we will grow credit cards this year. But we believe that it\u2019s likely that the home equity book will continue to decline, not -- if you look at the home equity book and you divide it in the kind of the post crisis and pre-crisis book, pre-crisis book just continues to decline as we\u2019ve been talking about for years. But we expect the post crisis book to grow. But I don\u2019t think that growth will offset the decline in the home equity book for 2018. And then likewise as John mentioned at it relates to auto, we believe that with all the changes that are going on in the auto portfolio, notwithstanding the underlying credit improvement and new originations, that we will see a continued decline in that portfolio throughout 2018 and in our current estimates this maybe, the lines will start to cross the fourth quarter this year may be first quarter 2019, it\u2019s -- we will find out. But I would think about our consumer portfolio, we are optimistic about -- again about the impact of the tax act on consumers. Erika Najarian : Follow-up on the underwriting side. Tim Sloan : Yes, we don\u2019t anticipate making any changes to our underwriting. Our underwriting, as it relates to mortgage, that we look at those every day and we are going to be competitive from a market standpoint. We are also going to take the long-term view and not get too aggressive at any one point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Congratulations Matt. You were right. We needed to provide $1 expense guidance. We listened to you. Can you mark that down in your calendar? Matt O'Connor: I do think it\u2019s a good first step given [Multiple Speakers] 2019 and 2020 trajectory, I think of great importance. So, appreciate that\u2019s coming in a few minds. The only thing I \u2018m really been focused on and obviously the market as well is just the legacy issues and at this point a year and a quarter after taking over CEO and obviously being in very senior roles for many years before, do you feel like you\u2019ve identified Tim, all of the legacy issues and they have been all disclosed. And now you are at the point where you\u2019re just finishing out working through them internally and hoping to reach settlements this year where applicable? Tim Sloan : Well Matt it\u2019s a very fair question, particularly with the accrual that we took this quarter. And my answer continues to be very consistent and that is I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress in terms of looking at the operations of the company. But I can\u2019t provide you with a guarantee or absolute assurance that we won\u2019t be making additional changes in the future to anything that we might find. But again, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. Matt O'Connor: And I guess I wonder why you can\u2019t. Because I feel like -- you\u2019ve been there a long time, John has been there a long time. I appreciate it\u2019s a big company and any company can have issues that arise. So, I am not trying to kind of get the all clear on everything for forever. But it does seem like there\u2019s a number of issues that are probably legacy in nature that you\u2019ve identified and I would assume you\u2019ve reviewed and re-reviewed in triple shake [ph] banks or are doing that now and I do still think it\u2019s great importance to be able to turn the page whether it\u2019s for the investors, the employees, I would think it\u2019s relevant too, so that\u2019s why just continued to push on this as well. Tim Sloan : Look this is very reasonable question and I love to live in a world where I can give you an absolute guarantee and certainty, but it\u2019s just not the world we live in. I mean we\u2019ve been working very hard and looking at operations across the company. We have invested a significant amount of money in doing that, we\u2019ve been very transparent when we have issues for all of you. I know that sometimes it\u2019s disappointing, but that was the promise that we made and when we find that we\u2019ve made any sort of mistakes we fix them and if there is a customer on the other end that\u2019s been harmed, we will remediate them. But I just can\u2019t provide you with that absolute guarantee at this moment in time, maybe someday I will, but I think it\u2019s going to be something we look at the rare view mirror over a longer period of time as opposed to having some inflection point today or tomorrow or the week after that. Matt O'Connor: And just last thing on this, are there certain businesses or regions or customer segments that you are still reviewing, maybe they\u2019re not as close customers to you like those third-party relationships that can be a little trickier like are there still segments that you\u2019re reviewing that you are just not a 100% sure is not issues or? Tim Sloan : Yeah. again, it\u2019s a fair question. I would say that we\u2019re continuing to look across the entire company as opposed to in any specific area. Again, we\u2019ve made a lot of progress, but as I reflect on my first year and a quarter in this role, I think it\u2019s fair to say that one of the mistakes that we\u2019ve made at this company was that we didn\u2019t have a thorough enough review of the businesses on an ongoing basis. So, our review will be continuing, we\u2019re never going to declare victory, we\u2019re going to always make sure that we\u2019ve got the right checks and balances from a corporate risk standpoint and an audit standpoint and we\u2019re making even more investments in the infrastructure and collecting data in a different way. So, we want to continue to make improvements. So, again the punch line matters that we\u2019ve made a lot of progress and we\u2019ve been very disclosive, but I can\u2019t provide you with absolute certainty. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning Tim. How are you guys doing. Questions on the fee side of the business. Maybe to start with, nice to see that trust side are actually moving the right way. I\u2019m just wondering how much of that is any improvement in transaction side. How much of it is the higher markets and what\u2019s your just basic outlook for how that business can do going ahead? Tim Sloan : Well we\u2019re optimistic and we\u2019ve seen growth in that business for the last few years, we\u2019ve had a nice transition [Multiple Speakers] that\u2019s a good point John, we\u2019ve had a nice transition in the senior leadership from David Carol who did a terrific job to John Wise. I think John mentioned in the fourth quarter that he thought we'd see 4% to 5% type revenue growth this year. And so, we continue to be optimistic. A large part of the increase in the fourth quarter to your point was related to higher underlying values, but again that tends to drive revenues in future too. But we continue to be optimistic about that business and to reinforce John's point about the improvement in referrals from community banking to wealth and investment management. Ken Usdin : Okay. And I guess I'm just wondering the markets are up a lot and your referrals are up a lot, but obviously the revenues are up but not as much. So that whole underlying shift to seize and decompression, is that start to stabilize or is it just an ongoing burden you always just have to overcome on with volume? Tim Sloan : Well, your point is fair. Because there have been some changes in the business that attracted the entire market because of the DOL rule and implementation last year. And it's a competitive business, but again, I think John was clear that he, John Jon Weiss clear that he thought that he would see 4%, 5% not even say 6% growth on the top-line. So, we're comfortable with that. John Shrewsberry : I also think this secular shift this intentional shift to emphasize recurring asset management relationships over transactional revenue. Means you've got the means, the outcome that you're describing but less volatility around it because you're less reliant on people trading stocks and more aligned with the managed solution which is a more stable form of revenue. Ken Usdin : Got it, okay. And then just to keep on in another big area, fees. Just on the mortgage business, you got your platform rolling out and there is obviously it's major potential transition happening just with rates, and tax and housing markets. So, what's your expectation for just your size of the mortgage market and what do you think share can be? And within that, you've got a big, big mix sale of correspondent versus retail as a percentage. And can your new platform start to change that mix? Tim Sloan : Yeah. So, I think the NBA is calling for the overall mortgage market size to be down a little bit. They can't factor in what might happen with more economic expansion as a result of the tax act. But call the size of the market unchanged to down, it's probably going to continue to be a little bit more of a purchase market from a reify market or trending more in that direction, which is a more competitive market for us to operate in. As a big servicer, we have an advantage in the reify market. As a result, our retail share may end up being a little bit lower, but we do a lot of correspondent lending and servicing. And so, our volumes represent the aggregate of what we originate directly and what we fund and service for correspondents.  So that's part of why margin is down because that mix from retail to correspondent means our costs are less but our revenue opportunities is less too. So, I think it's our expectation that the market is flat to down a little bit. Again, unless tax reform does something remarkable which will be great. I think it's our expectations that gets, it stays competitive. I mentioned in my comments. We think the first quarter is going to be a lower margin quarter than the fourth quarter based on what we can see. Some of that is specific behavior and a part of the agencies, because of programs that they run in the fourth quarter to get things done. And as it relates to our competitiveness, whether it's our feet on the street or our technological innovation that's rolling out right now, we anticipate being as competitive as we can possibly be in every market and maintaining our leading share. And so, it's a big point of emphasis for Michael DeVito and the folks who manage that team, but we don't want to cede that position. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. Hey, good morning. Quick question on the loan growth, it looks like CRE was loan growth again this quarter and you did mention that you saw focusing on continued credit discipline. But can you maybe breakdown kind of what you are seeing in that market currently, how much farther do you have to kind of wind down this book, I mean how much lower can it go? Tim Sloan : We don\u2019t want to wind down this book. I mean we are the largest commercial real estate lender by far in not only in total but in almost every product type and we have the most diverse and broadest commercial real estate platform in the market. We are committed to this business long-term. But to be committed to the real estate business long-term you need to also make important and disciplined decisions when you see that you are at a period in the cycle that doesn\u2019t last forever but a period in a cycle where, things that that -- underwriting standard or pricing might be a little bit out of balance. That\u2019s how you get to stay in this business through cycles because you made good decisions. So, we want to grow this book but we want to grow it in a way that makes the right decisions for our shareholders.  So, what we have seen this year is an increase in competition, slightly lower in credit spread -- standards excuse me, and a little bit more aggressive pricing and that's meant that our book has declined a little bit. But again, we\u2019ve got a balanced business here and so our real estate capital markets business has absolutely been on fire and you can see that other parts of revenue in the company. So, I wouldn\u2019t look at this as we\u2019re purposely rolling down this book because we don\u2019t like the business, we love the business. We want to grow it so that we are ready for next year and the next cycle. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then maybe a separate question on the retail bank metrics, like the primary consumer checking account growth, just the other positive year-over-year, if you look at it where it was last December, you\u2019re up 3% year-on-year. May be if you could break down what you are seeing with regards to new customer acquisition versus the attrition? Because I thought you said the attrition had slowed, did you see the acceleration in the fourth quarter? Thanks. Tim Sloan : I don\u2019t think we saw acceleration. I think that Mary Mack and team are doing a terrific job in terms of fundamentally changing that platform. It takes time to make changes in a business that has 5,800 branches and call centers and tens of thousands of team members who are working very hard. We made changes in terms of incentive plan. We made changes in terms of the management team to streamline that. We\u2019ve improved training and we\u2019ve also delegated responsibility so that our folks in branches can address customer opportunities and needs more quickly, that takes time. But I am pleased with the progress and our expectation for 2018 as we are going to see checking account growth, I would also say -- primary checking account growth, I would also say an improvement over what you saw in the fourth quarter but I would also say that underlying value of those accounts has increased, and we\u2019ve talked about that at Investor Day last year. And we are continuing to see that trend. John Shrewsberry : One thing I would add is that the 2015, \u201816 primary checking account growth numbers were also benefited by a major attempt to convert people who were primary. They were customers of Wells Fargo but they were at that point primary into primary customers. And so, we had a backlog of relationships to convert to primary that we\u2019ve, I\u2019d say we basically worked through and now it\u2019s really about net new customers to the bank and making them primary customers. And so just to comp owner. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Back to the loan growth front. Thanks for the color on the areas you\u2019ve commented on already. I know you\u2019re seeing some of the interest in still and auto and declines in home equity and you\u2019re being selective in CRE. So, given that as you look at 2018, can we see growth in 2018 in average loans versus full year 2017? And as a commercial that can really drive that growth despite the headwinds? Tim Sloan : Yeah. Hope so, our plan is to do that, John. I think the wild card is just the pace of underlying economic growth, and we\u2019re the largest lender in this country and so we\u2019re dependent not only on the hard work and effort of the great team of relationship managers, but it\u2019s also a function of economic growth. So, if we see an increase in economic growth that should be a net positive. Just anecdotally I would tell you that I\u2019ve spent a lot of money in the last week and a half with our commercial and corporate customers and there is a lot of optimism out there. John Shrewsberry : The C&I loans, credit card and first mortgage is likely where our net loan growth is going to come from in 2018 and similar to the quarter. John Pancari : Got it, got it. Thanks John. And then just secondly on capital, I know we\u2019ve seen that article recently in the journal in the camel ratings and everything. And assuming -- I know you haven\u2019t commented on it, but want to say if you have anything to say about the ratings. And then secondly if that is true and everything is there an implication in terms of capital deployment. And if you could just talk about how you\u2019re thinking about deployment as you look at 2018? Tim Sloan : So, fair question given the media coverage. We can\u2019t comment on confidential supervisory information from our regulators and so we won\u2019t. But as it relates to capital return, I think that I said it early in the call and John repeated it that we\u2019re pleased to have increased the amount of capital returned to our shareholders by 16% year-over-year and our expectation is that we will continue to increase capital return because we have excess capital at the company to fund our growth. And so, our goal is to reduce our 11.9% Tier 1 common equity number over the next few years to something closer to 10%. I don\u2019t know exactly what that means in terms of what our submission for C-CAR is this year or next year for that matter. But, we\u2019re certainly going in that direction. John, I don\u2019t know if you have any other comment. John Shrewsberry : No, that\u2019s right the I guess I was interpreting the question also mean deployment for growth and loan portfolio and that would be the first call on our capital share and make loans for our customers. There is no M&A in our future that would be a use of capital that we can possibly imagine at this point. And thus, the high starting point in the ongoing relatively high level of capital generation should lead to attempting to return more of that to shareholders. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi. Hey, good morning. Just want to clarify the outlook on expenses the range for 2018, that would include the community contribution stuff that you list on page 3, the $400 million on donations and the other things there? John Shrewsberry : Yes, it does. And the higher base pay for the roughly $70,000 fee numbers. John McDonald : Okay. And then, John, you also mentioned hoping to get to 59 handles on the efficiency ratio by late 2018? I guess you had to kind of make some assumptions about kind of the economy and rate hikes there. Could you just give us some sense of what it would take to kind of get there? John Shrewsberry : Yeah, I mean. I think we are imagining 3 rate hikes built into our baseline scenario. We don't have a lot of economic impact from tax reform built into our current forecast for 2017 to the extent that it achieves its desired goals to see some upside there. I think those would be the big drivers. And one of the key estimations we have to make as what's going to happen with deposit pricing throughout the course of the year. I think we're anticipating normalizing betas over the course of the year that feeds into that range. John McDonald : Okay. And how do you evaluate further reduction in the swaps, what's kind of the calculus that you go through? And has that remain fairly way you've got. John Shrewsberry : Sure. The calculus is what is our outlook for rates over the next couple of years versus what the forward curve implies because that's where swap pricing comes from. And if we think that if there is a chance that we're going to be earning more over the next couple of years, then it might make sense to get out of today's fixed rate to get back into a floating rate scenario. Then we do the math to figure out what the swap mark is and the amortization cost is and what the benefit of increased asset sensitivity is. And we've been doing that and it's made sense to us to reduce that position. John McDonald : Okay. And then just on the expense outlook and efficiencies. I know you don't want to get into 2019, 2020 too much, but just maybe broader thoughts. I'm not sure if this came up before, I think it might have, but with all the tailwinds that you have in '19 and '20 is, is there any reason that directionally the 2019 expenses wouldn't be down absent a material pickup in business operations. And then maybe John, you can address that. And Tim, are you holding or Tim, is there any reason you wouldn't be holding a team to getting back that efficiency ratio middle of that range, the 55 to 59 by 2019 and further deeper into the range in 2020. Is that broadly a goal that you're going to hold folks too? Tim Sloan : I'll pick that. That's a goal that I hold myself too as well as the senior management team. So, you're spot on there John. John Shrewsberry : And there is no reason, for the reasons that we've laid out, the expectation is that those incremental cost would be coming off in '19 and '20 and expenses would continue to trend lower. The caveat I guess I would give is if there was some -- several years ago we went through a period like this where we gave specific expense guidance and then there was a wild mortgage reify here with a revenue opportunity was used and expenses, direct expenses grew to reflect to take advantage of it. So, absence something like that, which we'd all be happy about if occurred, then as you say, there is no reason to believe the expenses shouldn't keep coming down based on these structural items that we're talking about that will fall off. John McDonald : Okay. And again, just to clarify Tim. How would you phrase the efficiency ratio goal over the next 2 to 3 years? Tim Sloan : As we said, our expectation is to get -- by the end of this year to get down to 59 handle and then continue to make progress year after year after year. We should be within the 55% to 59%, that\u2019s a goal to get in there. And then once we are in that range, we are going to continue to make progress. We\u2019ve got to improve the efficiency of this company. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. A couple of follow-ups. One, the 53.5 to 54.5 expense target that you\u2019ve put out for this next year, what is the relative number that we are assessing that against in 2017? I know there\u2019s a lot of one-timers here. And I just wanted to get what your view on 2017 like-for-like is? John Shrewsberry : We\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t really normalize our 2017 expenses and I think many people would obviously look to take out their larger operating losses that we experienced. But beyond that I wouldn\u2019t view much of a normalization for you just because it\u2019s a slippery slope. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then second question is just on liquidity. I noticed there was a couple of questions already on that. But I think if I heard you correctly, it accelerates beyond what we\u2019re generating today. Your expectation is that you might need to reset deposit rates, did I hear you right on that? Tim Sloan : Actually, my reference there is more to the market. I don\u2019t think people appreciate how much the industry is holding the line of retail and small business deposit prices. It might be as a result of the fact that there\u2019s been a lackluster on demand. And if the economy heats up because of tax reform and everybody has got higher loan growth, then somebody is going to -- may very well begin to defend their deposit franchise in order to fund it, or to attract deposits in order to fund it. So that\u2019s more of an industry comment than a Wells Fargo comment specifically. Betsy Graseck : Okay. If you mind giving us your view on your situation just grace the question because your LDR looks like it\u2019s around 73 or 74 so, seems like there \u2026 John Shrewsberry : I would say that we don\u2019t think that we have to do too much, although again if there\u2019s a big cyclical change that causes betas to catch up to where people might have previously imagined they should be, looking at prior cycles of rate increases, then if we\u2019re looking for a catalyst or imagining one that could cause that, one of the things that could cause it is a big pick up in loan demand, it hasn\u2019t been there. And we\u2019ve been studying deposit response as an industry without that loan demand, if you were to add loan demand, it could change things, that\u2019s my point. Your point is right, our loan-to-deposit ratio is very modest. We\u2019ve got a lot of liquidity where we are not in a position where we think we need to attract a lot of incremental deposits to fund the next $10 billion of loans. But the industry overall has -- should be thinking about whether an increase in loan demand overall changes the calculus for deposit pricing. Tim Sloan : And Betsy just on deposit pricing for a minute, I would just also make an observation separate from John\u2019s point which I completely agree with on loan demand and the potential impact is that when I think about the interaction and the relationship that we have with consumers, it\u2019s not just about deposit pricing, it\u2019s about how much firms are expanding from a marketing standpoint which doesn\u2019t go into deposit pricing line and I think there\u2019s been a lot of discussion about that this year, that\u2019s maybe ramped up for some firms more than others. It\u2019s also about the massive investment that we\u2019ve been making in technology to improve innovation so that we\u2019re not at the margin just competing on price, we\u2019re competing upon the value of the relationship and the convenience in the service that we can provide. And we look at the pace of innovation particularly for us, I think that\u2019s been one of the drivers and some of the reasons why we\u2019ve been able to continue to attract deposits. We\u2019re providing real value to all of our customers because of the massive increase in innovation and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. So, we\u2019re not just competing on price. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Good morning. Thank you very much for those comments on CNBC this morning, my mother thinks -- you\u2019re now her favorite analyst. Scott Siefers : At least I am somebody's favorite analyst. Thank you, please pass along my gratitude. Tim, I guess actually John I have got a question for you. On the NII outlook for 2018, I appreciate the comments earlier on the rate outlook that\u2019s actually there. Are you still thinking kind of a low single-digit number for NII growth year-on-year is good for 2018? John Shrewsberry : Yeah. I think it\u2019s a little earlier to fully forecast it. There is a lot going on. And we\u2019re just talking about deposit pricing and what that means that could be a huge driver of this year. It wasn\u2019t really as much of a topic last year. We\u2019re shaving some NII of the top for the -- on the tax equivalency front for our tax-exempt investments that\u2019s probably worth $400 million and some change in 2018 versus 2017. And then the loan growth and cash deployment are going to matter too. So, it is a stated goal that we\u2019re trying to grow net interest income period-over-period, year-over-year and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re vectoring towards. But, at this point may be at Investor Day it will be easier to think about the year as a whole because we will have a quarter and some change behind us. But, I wouldn\u2019t pencil in last year\u2019s growth rate this year until we get a little bit further into and we know what tax reform means and a couple of other things. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. Perfect. And I think you hit my next SCE question on there as well. So, appreciate it. And then actually just on the effective tax rate guidance. When you look at sort of gap between your effective tax rate and the FTE tax rate, any noticeable change that we should expect now that tax reform is down in there? John Shrewsberry : No, no I don\u2019t think so. And we\u2019ll probably continue to give \u2013 well we\u2019ll certainly give call out changes in our guidance on the effective tax rate overall if conditions change throughout the course of the year, it will be impacted by a couple of things. Most notably how much money we\u2019re making. But that\u2019s the number for now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the fees, on the overdraft to wide product and forgive me if I missed, but did you quantify how much that adversely impacted deposit fees in 4Q. And how much more it could linger on into the 1Q 2018 results? Tim Sloan : So, it was $19 million in the quarter although it came in during the quarter. And so, it will be -- it will probably be more in the first quarter. And we\u2019ll see how customers adapt to that capability overtime.  And just for anybody, who isn't familiar with the product, essentially if you overdraft payments tonight and your direct deposit hits in the morning, we don't charge you for the overdraft, it happened the night before, that's where the Rewind comes from. So, we'll see a full quarter of it in Q1, we'll call it out at the end of the quarter and make it transparent so the people can model it in. But we think it's a very useful capability to help folks who are generally speaking right at the end of the pay cycle when they have an overdraft situation and then rectify it the next day. Saul Martinez : Okay, that's helpful. And secondly on John, on your comments on deposit betas and the possibility of sort of maybe a non-linear type of increase in deposit betas if you start to get loan growth. Is there any way to -- I know you're probably going to say it's difficult to put numbers around it, but I'll ask anyway? If you were to see loan growth pickup and let's just say loan growth picks up to mid-single digits. Is there any way to think through the parameters about how much deposit betas can move up maybe based on history or some assumptions of consumer behavior? But is there any way to think about sort of the parameters around which you might see deposit competition and deposit betas move up in that type of scenario. John Shrewsberry : I don't have a silver bullet for you. But I can tell you that you could stress or model some sort of a catch up to historically normal levels, call it the 40% level. And then ask yourself, by bank who might go first and why? And as Tim mentioned, there are a lot of non-economic reasons for customers who want to maintain relationships maintain balances etcetera call it the very full service with the less full service. All of those things matter. But everybody's deposit franchise is going to look a little bit different. So, people have more core primary types of transactional account relationships and some people are funded with how their money they are seeking the highest yield at any point in time. And that's going to, it's different banks that are going to behave differently. My general guess is that within the relevant range for likely loan growth for Wells Fargo, that if we achieve the higher end of that range, and the impact on our deposit price isn't really going to be because we think that we need to go out and raise more money and jack up our deposit cost, but rather that it's happening to others and they're doing it and we respond -- and if we feel we need to we will be responding to what's happening in the market. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : Hi, gentlemen. I have a couple of questions for you. And this probably falls into the last question as well. For many years, you were the lowest rate payer in the nation and you are able to maintain that through the location of branches et cetera et cetera. From a competitive standpoint and given the issues over the last couple of years, do you need to kind of get into the middle of the pack or the top? I mean how do you feel competitively, where you need to be positioned with deposit pricing in a rising rate environment. Tim Sloan : Yeah, Nancy it's a very fair question. I don't think our view particularly as it relates to retail consumer customers has really changed. And what you have seen in our deposit pricing so far, this year is that we're one of the lowest if not the lowest in the industry. And our expectation is that we will continue to be able to do that because of the franchise that we have, not only the physical franchise but also the digital franchise that we\u2019ve continued to invest in, based upon the innovation and the convenience that we are providing to our customers. I think when you move from traditional retail deposit customers to wealth customers, it\u2019s more competitive and you\u2019ve seen the higher weighted there and we\u2019re kind of in the middle, and that\u2019s fine with us. I think we\u2019re comfortable there. And then as you move to larger corporate customers or financial institutions and the like, it\u2019s very competitive, where your deposit days are close to 100 percentage you can get. And I think that\u2019s been pretty consistent through cycles for us as well as the rest of the industry. So that\u2019s how I would break it down. John Shrewsberry : On the last point I would add, we\u2019ve been a little bit more active with some of the financial institution customers to get their deposits because we don\u2019t have a leverage ratio problem so we can afford to have a slightly better balance sheet. We can use the liquidity from time-to-time. So, if we weren\u2019t doing that, because that is the highest cost deposit number, we probably weighted average basis like a lower deposit cost payer. But it\u2019s really some purpose to do more business of various types with those customers by having that deposit relationship. Nancy Bush : Okay. And also, the follow-on I have is about branch closures. And I am sure you guys have seen the articles over the past couple of months, there was a series I think in the Wall Street Journal a few weeks ago, about how rural America is being impacted by branch closures that there are many small towns now that basically have no bank branches. And I am wondering if this is the coming of bigger regulatory issue or it\u2019s coming more on to the regulatory radar screen and do you guys anticipate that you may in the future have to not close branches that you would have closed otherwise because of their locations? Tim Sloan : Well Nancy again it\u2019s a fair question. I think that when we look at our branch network, we included a number of factors beyond just a P&L for the branch as a likely expectation for growth or quality of customers. There is also CRA type requirements and other reasons that we want to keep branches open in certain markets.  But to your specific question about regulatory interaction, we haven\u2019t had any increase in regulatory interaction related to a significant increase of -- regulatory interaction related to rural branches as of this point. John Shrewsberry : I would say there is big investment in digital capability that allows people to bank from anywhere including opening accounts, including applying for and having credit trenches [ph] including deposit taking, eases the burden doesn\u2019t completely remove it, but it makes it easier for people who live far from branches even if there is a branch there, may be 30 miles away, still be in the county. We are making it easier for people to do that from home. So, it\u2019s a better situation than it was 20 years ago or 40 years ago and that same calculus is being weighed. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning. Can you guys share with us -- you talked about bringing this efficiency ratio down with 59 handle on by the end of the year and then further improvement in following periods. What percentage of the improvement comes from revenue versus expenses or vice versa. How much is going to come from expenses versus revenues? Tim Sloan : Well, you can see the range that we\u2019re talking about for expenses for the year and while that\u2019s an annual number and other quarterly number. We showed some sensitivity around our 2017 on our revenue items. So, right now we\u2019re very focused on specific actions that are being taken on the expense side. And we have to make some assumptions about what\u2019s happening in the revenues estimate, what the handle range will be on efficiency later in the year.  And very importantly, I\u2019d remind everybody that Q1 is a very -- is high for seasonal expense I think you know that, it is your business. But that\u2019s something to account for. So, John asked the question earlier about what\u2019s going to happen -- or I forgot who asked the question about NII in 2018, there is a range of estimates depending on the drivers that I mentioned similarly on the noninterest income front. We\u2019ve got a lot of things that are core and easy -- easier to forecast but there\u2019ll be other just as well. So, we\u2019re trying to grow revenue. We have control over expense and it\u2019s the expense that we\u2019re through specifically pointing to in terms of what\u2019s driving the outcome. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then in your community banking metrics in slide 24, you obviously give us good data on the digital customer\u2019s and such. And you guys have alluded to on the call about opening up new accounts and selling products through these lines and that seems to be where the industry is going and you\u2019re going. Can you share with us what kind of penetration you have whether it\u2019s credit cards or other types of consumer loan products that you\u2019re actually opening up through the online channel versus people having to come into a branch? Tim Sloan : So, right now I\u2019d say credit card is probably the easiest one to point to. I think 43% of card originations in 2017 were digital. Now, to be fair we -- it\u2019s not so important to us what that percentage is, we want more of our customers to have our card in their wallet and if they get it digitally or they get it in-person either will work. But, 43% are trending towards half of our card openings were digitally transacted in 2017. That\u2019s an interesting metric and that\u2019s up from a very small percentage in prior years.  Mortgage will be -- this will be the year to see to see what the trend is there as we fully roll out the digital mortgage applications, people who aren\u2019t -- including people who aren\u2019t already customers in Wells Fargo. And while we have the digital account opening process for two of the investor which is something that we\u2019ll be measuring all year and figure out how much benefit our customers and prospects drive from interacting with us in that way. Gerard Cassidy : And just on the mortgage, when do you guys go live with that again? I knew it was this year, but is it first quarter or second quarter? Tim Sloan : Well, it\u2019s live now for a people who are already customers of Wells Fargo. You can enter through -- I know you all are customers at Wells Fargo, you can log on to our online banking or digital banking platform you can see it there. But it will be available for all comers in the first quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then just my final question in your wholesale banking side you talk about investment banking market share dropped to 3.6% versus 4.4%, the narrow scope focus. Can you give us some background or color on what you mean by what you did to the market share came down? John Shrewsberry : Yeah. And let me give in order that\u2019s going to reflect some large deal volume could be some leverage finance volume, it could be cross boarder activity, some of which are probably higher beta for us depending on whether we get it or not. I think on an annual basis, we probably assume that we're still going to trend towards the 5% 6% plus market share range, which is where we've been recently. But I'm going to think terribly different. Tim Sloan : As you said to reinforce John's point. I think what we saw in fourth quarter was more leverage buyout type transactions and kind of this because of our underlying credit discipline. We tend to have a lower percent market share in those types of deals. And so that would at the margin probably have driven most of that decline. Tim Sloan : Again, thank you all for joining us this morning. I know it's always a busy morning the first day of earnings for the industry. I want to reiterate the fact that 2017 was a very transformational year for Wells Fargo. And I also want to emphasize the hard work, dedication and resiliency of our team members, who made the company a better bank today than it was a year ago. And again, notwithstanding the challenges that we have ahead, I'm optimistic that Wells Fargo will be a better bank a year from now. So again, thank you for your support. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Shrewsberry - Senior EVP and CFO Analysts : Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company John McDonald - Bernstein Erika Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch John Pancari - Evercore ISI Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley Nancy Bush - NAB Research Saul Martinez - UBS Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan, and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss preliminary results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our Web-site at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to [caution you that we] [ph] may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web-site. I will now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Tim Sloan. Timothy J. Sloan: Thank you, John. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. I know it's a busy morning for everyone. As we noted in our earnings release, our first quarter financial results are preliminary. These preliminary results are subject to change due to our ongoing discussions that we are having with the CFPB and OCC to resolve matters regarding our compliance risk management program and our past practices involving certain automobile collateral protection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate lock extensions, which the CFPB and the OCC have collectively offered to resolve for an aggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties. At this time, we are unable to predict the final resolution of the CFPB/OCC matter and cannot reasonably estimate our related loss contingency. Accordingly, the preliminary financial results we report today may need to be revised to reflect additional accruals for the CFPB/OCC matter when we file our final statements in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC. It is important to note that these are not new matters. Turning to our preliminary first quarter results, we earned $5.9 billion. Our results included continued strong credit performance, liquidity, and capital levels. We returned $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter, up 30% from a year ago. There were [indiscernible] noteworthy items that impacted our results, which John will highlight later on the call. I want to focus my comments on the actions we took during the quarter to transform Wells Fargo as part of our efforts to build a better bank and rebuild trust with our stakeholders. These efforts include progress on our [six] [ph] goals. Starting with our goal of becoming the leader in customer service and advice, we focused on new ways to create a better customer experience. This includes a number of changes to help our customers better manage their accounts by leveraging data and technology. In the first quarter we rolled out predictive banking, which provides personalized insights and guidance to mobile deposit customers. A year ago we introduced automatic zero balance alerts and we now send over 20 million low and zero balance alerts a month. In November last year, we introduced Overdraft Rewind, which has helped over 800,000 customers avoid overdraft charges. We also offer our customers a variety of ways to waive the standard monthly service fees on checking accounts based on account usage or direct deposit, and as a result approximately 90% of our checking account customers do not pay a monthly fee. These actions are designed to help our customers succeed financially and to build long-term relationships, and we have made changes to compensation and processes in our branches which are also improving customer service, and in the first quarter customer loyalty survey scores reached their highest levels since August of 2016. Team member engagement is our second goal and I believe we have the best team in the industry. In March we increased the minimum hourly pay rate for U.S.-based team members to $15 an hour and approximately 36,000 team members received an increase. We also reviewed pay for team members whose salaries were slightly above the new minimum wage and this month we are increasing base pay for approximately 50,000 additional team members. In March, we granted an award of restricted stock rights to about 250,000 team members, including 50 shares of stock for full-time eligible team members and 30 shares for part-time team members. In the first quarter, our team member turnover continues to be about 15% below fourth quarter of 2016 levels. Our next goal is being a leader in innovation. In the first quarter we rolled out our digital mortgage application which combines the power of Wells Fargo's data with a You Know Me customer experience. In many cases homebuyers are now able to receive preapproved loan decisions immediately, either online or through their mobile device. In March, 10% of completed retail applications were through our digital mortgage application. We also started a team member pilot of our Control Tower feature designed to provide customers a comprehensive view of the places their Wells Fargo card or account information is connected. January, we were named one of only 12 companies in Apple's Business Chat pilot, which is a new way to connect with our customers and accelerates our customer service transformation towards messaging. Our industry-leading technology was recently recognized by Dynatrace, which named Wells Fargo's mobile app #1 in overall performance, functionality and quality, and availability. As part of our goal of setting the global standard in managing all forms of risk, over the past 19 months we've taken significant actions to strengthen the way we manage operational and compliance risk at Wells Fargo. In March, [indiscernible] new risk management organizational design, which is an important step to ensuring that risk management functions operate independently and provide improved and effective oversight of our businesses. In addition, per the Consent Order, earlier this month we submitted governance and oversight, and compliance and operational risk management program plans to the Federal Reserve. Our goal of making positive contributions to the communities we serve was recognized in the first quarter by United Way Worldwide, who named our workplace giving program #1 in the United States for the ninth consecutive year. We also increased our charitable contributions in the first quarter as part of our goal to increase donations to non-profit and community organizations by approximately 40% in 2018. As part of our goal of delivering long-term shareholder value, we have been making progress on streamlining and centralizing [indiscernible] and our organizational structures. In our auto business, we completed the centralization of collections and funding from 57 regional business centers into three regional centers during the first quarter, which helps us to further standardize processes in that business. Our auto relationship team remains in the individual markets, keeping us close to our customers. We are also closely looking at how our customers are using our channels. Branches continue to play an important part in serving our customers and we will have as many branches for our customers to use for as long as they want to use them. However, our customers are increasingly using our digital channels and digital sessions and they increased 13% from a year ago, while teller and ATM transactions declined 4%. We closed 58 branches in the first quarter and we are on track to close approximately 300 branches this year, which is an increase [indiscernible] 250 branches we announced at our last Investor Day. As we highlighted last quarter, we currently expect our total branch network to decline to approximately 5,000 by the end of 2020. I'm confident that we are on the right path with the transformational changes we are making and with our progress against our six goals. We have more work to do and it will take time to put all of our challenges behind us, but the result will be a better Wells Fargo for all of our stakeholders. John will now discuss our financial results in more detail. John R. Shrewsberry: Thanks, Tim, and good morning everyone. We highlight the noteworthy items that impacted our preliminary results on Slide 2. Our revenue included a $643 million gain from sales of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans; $250 million in mark-to-market unrealized equity gains due to the new financial instruments accounting standard, which I'll discuss a little later on the call; a $202 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services; and $176 million reduction from a LOCOM adjustment relating to $1.9 billion of loans transferred to held-for-sale. Our expenses included $781 million [indiscernible] seasonally higher personnel expense, and $668 million of operating losses, largely litigation accruals. Our results also included a $550 million reserve release, driven by a significantly improved outlook on hurricane related losses. And our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 18.8%. On Page 3 we provide an update on the Consent Order. Tim mentioned, we submitted governance and oversight, and compliance and operational risk management program plans to the Federal Reserve. We take the Consent Order seriously and we'll work to fully satisfy all of the Consent Order's requirements. We are focused on compliance with the Consent Order's asset cap and maintaining liquidity and other financial risk management targets, while minimizing the impact to our customers, minimizing adverse long-term strategic effects, and maintaining our financial risk discipline. With nearly $2 trillion in total assets, we believe we can meet our customers' financial needs and continue to deliver strong results without growing our balance sheet in the near term. As a reminder, prior to the Consent Order, we were already focused on reducing our exposure to riskier assets including certain legacy consumer real estate loans and near-prime and sub-prime auto loans. We have also maintained our credit risk discipline for new originations in commercial real estate during a period of high liquidity and increased competition, resulting in four consecutive quarters of lower balances. Our balance sheet declined $36.4 billion from year-end, primarily due to a $32 billion decline in commercial deposits from financial institutions, including approximately $15 billion of actions taken to comply with the Consent Order asset cap. The earnings impact of managing within the asset cap was modest in the first quarter due to the minimal actions we needed to take. We'd expect the earnings impact to increase in subsequent quarters but we continue to estimate that the net income after tax impact will be $300 million to $400 million for the full year of 2018. I'm going to highlight much of what's on Page 4 later on the call, so let me just point out that the decline in deposits drove the $20 billion reduction in cash and short-term investments in the first quarter, and the decline in stockholders' equity was driven by a $2.8 billion decline in [OCI] [ph], resulting primarily from higher rates. I will be highlighting our income statement drivers on Page 5 throughout the call, so let me just mention that we adopted new accounting standards in the first quarter, which we summarized on Page 17 and 18 of the earnings release. I'll summarize here the two most significant impacts. With the adoption of the new recognition and measurement of financial instruments standard, all equities, including those previously classified as AFS, are now required to be mark-to-market to earnings each quarter, and as a result in the first quarter we recognized $250 million of unrealized gains on equity securities. This accounting standard will increase volatility and while the impact this quarter was positive, in future quarters the impact could be negative or positive. The second one is the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard, which didn't significantly impact our bottom line results but it does change where some of the revenue and expense items are reported. The most meaningful change for us is card fees. In the first quarter, card fees were reduced by $43 million due to card payment network charges which were previously reported in outside data processing expense now being netted against related interchange and network fees. Turning to loans on Page 6, average loans declined $798 million from the fourth quarter, with commercial loan growth of $1.8 billion more than offset by a $2.6 billion decline in consumer loans. The decline in loan balances were not related to any actions we took in connection with the Consent Order but was driven by opportunistic or strategic loan sales, seasonality, and continued declines in certain portfolios that we've been reducing for some time including auto, Pick-a-Pay mortgage, and junior lien mortgage loans. I'll summarize the specific drivers of period-end loan declines starting on Page 7, but let me first point out that the average loan yields increased to 4.5% in the first quarter, the highest yield since the fourth quarter of 2012. Commercial loans were relatively flat compared with fourth quarter, with C&I loans up $1.6 billion offset by continued declines in commercial real estate due to continued credit discipline in a competitive highly liquid financing market as well as ongoing paydowns on existing and acquired loans. Consumer loans declined $9.5 billion [indiscernible] fourth quarter. The first mortgage loans were down $1.4 billion, driven by sales of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans. The sales were consistent with our ongoing evaluation of non-strategic portfolios and were similar to the decision to sell part of the Pick-a-Pay portfolio in the second quarter of last year. We continue to have growth in high-quality non-conforming loans, which were up $3.2 billion from the fourth quarter. Junior lien mortgage loans continue to decline as paydowns more than offset new originations. Credit card loans declined $1.9 billion from the fourth quarter from seasonality, consistent with the decline we had in the first quarter of 2017. Balances increased $1.4 billion from the first quarter of 2017 due to higher purchase volume, and 11% growth in new accounts reflecting higher bonus offers, and a 55% increase in digital channel acquisitions. 43% of new credit card accounts in the first quarter were originated through digital channels. Our new credit cards have higher balances, 31% higher than a year ago. We expect credit card balances to grow as we continue to focus on digital channels and customer engagement. Auto loans were down $3.8 billion from the fourth quarter and included the transfer of $1.6 billion of loans to held-for-sale as a result of the pending sale of certain assets of Reliable Financial Services, a Puerto Rican subsidiary of our auto business. This sale is expected to close in the second quarter. After declining for five consecutive quarters, auto originations have stabilized the last two quarters. With the completion of the centralization of our collection and funding activities, which Tim highlighted earlier, we're now positioned to start to increase originations over time and currently expect the portfolio of balances to begin growing in early 2019. Average deposits declined $14.4 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by lower commercial deposits. Average consumer and small business banking deposits declined $2.1 billion as higher community bank deposits were more than offset by lower deposits in Wealth and Investment Management, reflecting movement into other investments. Our average deposit cost increased 6 basis points from the fourth quarter and was up 17 basis points from a year ago, versus the 75 basis point change in the Fed fund's rate. The increase in our average deposit cost was driven by increases in commercial and Wealth and Investment Management deposit rates, while rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits have remained stable. Since the increase in interest rates began at the end of 2015, [indiscernible] price-sensitive commercial deposits have been relatively consistent with the prior interest rate cycles, and we expect this trend to continue. It's important to note that our commercial deposits include a high percentage from financial institutions which drive our deposit betas higher as most of these deposits have betas of almost 100%. The response rate in Wealth and Investment Management has increased over the past couple of quarters but is still somewhat below historical trends, although we expect it to increase over time. While other consumer [indiscernible] banking deposit pricing has not yet responded to rate movements, we expect deposit betas in that category will start to increase. However, the timing of the increase is difficult to predict. Net interest income in the first quarter declined $75 million from the fourth quarter. The drivers of this reduction included an approximately $160 million decline from two fewer days in the quarter, $148 million from hedge ineffectiveness accounting, and $144 million in lower swap-related income related to the receive-fixed loan swap position that we finished unwinding early in the first quarter. These declines were partially offset by the net repricing benefit of higher interest rates. Our NIM was stable at 2.84% as the impact of hedge ineffectiveness accounting and lower swap income was offset by the repricing benefit of higher rates. I also wanted to update that impacts from the tax act reduced our NIM by 4 basis points in both the fourth quarter from a one-time adjustment related to leverage leases and in the first quarter primarily from a decline in tax equivalent yield on municipal bonds. We expect the reduction in tax equivalent yield that we recorded this quarter to remain at approximately the same level throughout the rest of the year, and while it should not impact linked quarter trends, it will reduce year-over-year trends by approximately 4 basis points. We highlighted on the call last quarter that we had started to unwind our receive-fixed commercial loan swaps, which provided a hedge against lower rates, and we completed that unwind in the first quarter. The cost of unwinding the swaps, which was approximately $1 billion, will be amortized through C&I interest income over the remaining life of the original contracts, which is approximately three years on average. It's important to note that during the extended period of low interest rates since the swaps are entered into, they generated incremental net income of approximately $3 billion. While the elimination of these swaps will reduce interest income in 2018, it has increased our asset sensitivity to be slightly above the middle of our previously provided guidance of 5 to 15 basis points for a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve and is expected to improve interest income in future periods as interest rates increase. From an interest rate risk management standpoint, we are fairly well-balanced and we will generally perform better in both higher and steeper interest rate environments. We have much larger repricing exposure for both assets and liabilities at the front-end of the curve and our earnings simulations are particularly dependent on deposit rate betas given the scale of that funding source. While we have significantly less assets and liabilities with repricing exposure at the long end of the curve, our net asset sensitivity to long-term rates is a meaningful part of our overall asset sensitivity profile. This sensitivity reflects both the reinvestment and premium amortization that occurs in our long-term debt securities and loan portfolios. Noninterest income declined $41 million from the fourth quarter. While the dollar decline was minimal, I want to spend some time describing the different drivers. Starting with deposit service charges, the $73 million decline from fourth quarter was driven largely by the impact of customer-friendly initiatives, including the first full quarter impact of Overdraft Rewind. Card fees declined $88 million from the fourth quarter. The new revenue recognition standard reduced these fees by $43 million. The rest of the decline was driven by seasonality. Mortgage banking results were in line with the fourth quarter. Servicing income increased $206 million, driven by higher net MSR valuation gains, lower unreimbursed servicing costs, and lower payoffs. Residential mortgage origination revenue declined $200 million from the seasonal declines in originations with volumes down $10 billion from the fourth quarter. We expect originations to increase in the second quarter, reflecting seasonality in the purchase market. The production margin in the first quarter was 94 basis points, down from 125 basis points in the fourth quarter. Approximately two-thirds of the margin decline was driven by market competition and the remaining one-third was driven by a higher percentage of corresponding originations in the first quarter which is significantly lower margins but also lower cost. Given current market pricing trends, we would expect our production margin to continue to decline into the second quarter. The $109 million decline in insurance fees was due to the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services in November. Finally, other income was up $44 million. The first quarter included a total of $845 million of gains from the sale of Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolios and Wells Fargo Shareowner Services and the fourth quarter included an $848 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services. Turning to expenses on Page 12, expenses declined $2.6 billion from the fourth quarter, largely driven by $2.9 billion of lower operating losses. On Page 13 I'll explain the drivers in more detail. The $594 million increase from the fourth quarter in compensation and benefits expense reflected $781 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses, in line with the seasonal increase last year. The seasonally higher personnel expenses will decline in the second quarter but salary expense is expected to grow reflecting increases which became effective late in the first quarter. Revenue related expenses declined $233 million from lower commissions and incentive compensation, primarily in Wholesale Banking and home lending. Third-party services were down $213 million, primarily from lower project-related spend which is typically higher in the fourth quarter and from lower legal expenses. The $2.6 billion decline in running the business non-discretionary [indiscernible] category reflected lower operating losses. On Page 14 we show the drivers of the $450 million year to year increase in expenses. Compensation and benefits expense increased $143 million, primarily due to salary increases and higher employee benefits expense, partially offset by the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services [indiscernible] reductions in Wholesale Banking. Our total FTE were down 3% from a year ago and also reflected lower FTE in Community Banking and consumer lending. The increase in expenses was also driven by a $386 million increase in higher operating losses from an increase in litigation accruals. On Page 15 we highlight the expected full-year 2018 total expense range, which has not changed since we provided it last quarter. The range of $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion includes approximately $600 million of typical operating losses and excludes any outsized litigation and remediation accruals and penalties. We will provide a dollar range for 2019 expenses at our Investor Day in May. Last quarter on our earnings call, we said that we expected to achieve a quarterly efficiency ratio with a 59 handle by the end of 2018. However, that expectation was prior to the issuance of the Consent Order. The expected decline in revenue from the balance sheet actions needed to comply with the Consent Order's asset cap will likely result in our efficiency ratio remaining above 59% throughout this year. However, we are still on track to achieve our targeted $4 billion of expense reductions by the end of 2019. As a reminder, this does not include the completion of core deposit intangible amortization expense at the end of this year, which will amount to $769 million in 2018. It also doesn't include the completion of the FDIC special assessment, which we expect should happen by the end of this year. Finally, it doesn't include expense savings due to business divestitures, which we highlight on Page [indiscernible]. We provided a similar page last quarter, which we have updated to include the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services in the first quarter. Turning to our segments, starting on Page 17, Community Banking earned $2.7 billion in the first quarter. The majority of the benefit from the tax act was included in Community Banking results in the fourth quarter, which was the primary reason for the linked quarter decline in earnings. On Page 18 we provided our Community Banking metrics. The primary consumer checking customer annual attrition rate was at the lowest level in five years and we've now had modest year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers for two consecutive quarters. On Page 19 we highlight strong growth in credit and debit card purchase volume, both up 8% from a year ago. As Tim highlighted, customer loyalty survey scores reached their highest levels since August of 2016 and overall satisfaction with most recent survey visit \u2013 overall satisfaction with the most recent visit survey scores continue to improve. Our team members have made great progress by focusing on customer service and providing exceptional service remains a priority. We know that exceptional customer service leads to positive outcome, so we continue to reinforce that within our branches. Turning to Page 20, Wholesale Banking earned $2.9 billion in the first quarter. Lower taxes drove both linked-quarter and year-over-year increases in net income. Wealth and Investment Management earned $714 million in the first quarter, and similar to Wholesale Banking, the lower tax rate drove the growth in [net income] [ph]. Turning to Page 22, our credit performance remained strong in the first quarter and our loss rate was 32 basis points of average loans. For the second consecutive quarter, all of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position, including our residential and junior lien portfolio. Nonperforming assets have declined for eight consecutive quarters and were less than 1% of total loans for the third consecutive quarter. As I highlighted earlier, we had $550 million of reserve release in the first quarter with approximately $400 million driven by a significant improvement in our outlook for 2017 hurricane related losses. As you may recall, in the third quarter of last year we increased reserve coverage by $450 million for potential hurricane related losses based on an initial review of our portfolio. The release this quarter also reflected continued improvement in residential real estate and lower loan balances. Turning to Page 23, our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in remained flat at 12%, still well above our target of 10%. Capital generation from earnings was more than offset by approximately 20 basis points of higher unrealized losses in OCI from higher interest rates and approximately 35 basis points of capital return to common shareholders. Risk-weighted assets were modestly lower than fourth quarter. Given we are well above our internal target, we remain focused on returning more capital to shareholders and returned a record $4 billion through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter, up 30% from a year ago. As a reminder, our share issuance in the first quarter is typically higher, reflecting annual issuances for benefit plans. Period-end common shares outstanding declined by 123 million shares or 2% from a year ago. In summary, our preliminary results in the first quarter continued to reflect strong asset quality, liquidity and capital, and we remain on track to achieve our target of $4 billion in expense saves by the end of 2019. While we continue to have some near-term challenges, we look forward to sharing more information regarding our financial outlook and the transformational changes we are making throughout Wells Fargo at Investor Day next month. And we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : I wanted to ask you guys to talk a little bit more about the outlook for net interest income, and specifically, there are a lot of moving parts here with the asset cap impact, you mentioned it's supposed to increase from here, but then there is the benefits to come from the swap roll-off over time and the NII sensitivity improving, so can you help us just understand like do you have an expectation you can grow NII and what will drive that, will it be rate more than volume at this point? John R. Shrewsberry: I'd say you mentioned the big drivers. The swap roll-off probably will be a net negative in 2018 because we are stepping down from the higher fixed rate to what currently is a lower floating rate. The expectation is that that floating rate moves up through where we were previously capped up on receiving fixed. So that's probably more of a 2019 benefit than a 2018 benefit. With respect to \u2013 the biggest driver obviously will be the growth in loans and deposits. And related to that, what happens with deposit pricing, particularly among retail and small business deposits, will be a big driver. We, the industry, have been outperforming previous expectations in this early part of the normalization of short term rates and to the extent that there is a meaningful catch-up, which I think people think is a fair expectation, that will actually probably be a negative adjustment while we go through that until we figure out what the stable beta is for those types of deposits. So, I would say those are probably the big drivers. At the longer end of the curve, we are continually reinvesting what's coming through in amortization and prepayments from a mortgage securities portfolio, and if long rates remain in the call it sub 2.80 range, then that won't be much of a driver. If they move up appreciably as the short end comes up, then there's an opportunity to earn more there as well. One important point that I'd make that I don't think is really well appreciated is that a lot of what's been happening on the asset side of our books as we've run down some higher yielding assets on purpose is that there's an increase in overall credit quality that's coming with a lower spread component. So even though I mentioned that our loan portfolio has the highest coupon with the highest rate that it's had since 2012, that's happening at the same time that the credit quality profile is improving. So, it's not quite apples to apples when we're thinking about one year's assets versus the next. Timothy J. Sloan: Ken, I would just reinforce a couple of themes that John mentioned. The asset cap really isn't impacting our ability to grow loans. I mean our folks are out there facing off with our customers every day across the entire platform. And so, I don't think we are going to have an impact from the asset cap on loan growth. Where you see an impact from the asset cap on deposits is primarily what you're seeing in the first quarter, at least for 2018, is related to some of the deposit relationships that we have in the financial institutions group, corporate and the like. Those tend to be higher cost deposits, and as we've talked about, generally have higher betas. Ken Usdin : Yes, good point. And my follow-up would just be then on the asset cap related stuff to that point, Tim, John, how would that traject from here? Like you said, you only got a little bit of that impact. Does it get to a run rate quickly just from the actions that you have already taken or is it just going to kind of be a bleed-in as we go along? John R. Shrewsberry: It depends on the organic rate of growth in underlying customer deposits and loans because the faster they grow, the more headroom we would create by taking up some of these [fake] [ph] deposits, as Tim described. And so, I guess if I were modelling it, I would bleed it in, but we still think 300 to 400 of [indiscernible] is the right number and it was negligible in the first quarter because of just the seasonal roll-down in the size of the balance sheet, and so it's more of the second half of the year realization. Ken Usdin : Okay, understood. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Just wanted to [indiscernible] what you can and can't do in terms of the \u2013 I know you can't say too much about the pending legal matter, but did the 1Q results include any provisioning for an eventual settlement with CFPB and OCC, are you able to put something in there, and you are saying that you might have to refine it from here? Timothy J. Sloan: John, it's a really fair question, and given the status of our discussions, all we can really say is what we said in the earnings release and then what I said in my prepared remarks. So, I again appreciate the question but that's as far as we would be able to go today. John McDonald : Okay. So just another somewhat related for you, Tim, with a lot of negative headlines in recent months, could you discuss how the team members and customers are dealing with the challenges here, specifically kind of how your employee and customer attrition, how has that been going in wealth management and the commercial businesses? We hear a lot of things outside the Company. What are you seeing in terms of reaction to headlines and all the challenges you have? Timothy J. Sloan: John, it's a really good question, and as you and I have talked about and we've talked about on these calls, it's truly been \u2013 when we think about rebuilding trust, first and foremost our most important asset in this Company is our people. And so we have made fundamental changes in how folks are compensated, making sure that more of our team members, now all of them, have the ability to be Wells Fargo shareholders, which I think is an important connection between what we do for our customers every day and what we are doing for our shareholders. We have made changes in how folks are \u2013 our incentive plans work, we've made changes in leadership and business practices, and the result has been a continued improvement in attrition or turnover. As I mentioned, it's about 30% better than it was in the fourth quarter of 2016. I've heard the same anecdotal stories that you have about folks from some of our businesses leaving in mass. I don't know what company they are talking about because it is just not happening. Not only is team member turnover down across all of our businesses, but in particular we are able to attract really high quality folks in entry-level positions but at senior leadership positions in the Company. In particular when we look at the Wells Fargo Advisors, as you mentioned, just because I hear about that just a little bit, the FA population that could be leaving to go to other competitors, that's down 24% year-over-year and in fact our experienced FA recruiting is up year-over-year and the productivity from our existing FA is up about 7% year-over-year. So again, I hear the same anecdotal comments all the time but it's not impacting our business to serve \u2013 our ability to serve our customers and we just don't see it in the numbers. John R. Shrewsberry: The other part of your question is around customer activity and I would say where we either see it, hear about it, talk about it from customers themselves or from team members is around our most publicly exposed types of customer groups. So the many types of business, there's more competition and more to talk about. We competed against other firms when they were going through perhaps analogous reputational cycles, and now others are working their hardest to do the same with us, and we have to control a bit harder. John McDonald : Okay. And one more follow-up on the regulatory side, you are doing the work to satisfy the Fed's Consent Order, is there any opportunity to be interactive with the regulator, can you get a sense along the way whether you are doing the things they want you to be doing, or do you have to kind of wait till the end to find out whether you are kind of on track with what their expectations are and yours are aligned? Timothy J. Sloan: John, it's a good question. I would say that we have a very active engagement model with all of our regulators. I think that's very important. And so, specifically if you're referring to the Consent Order with the Fed, we handed in our two plans. As they ask us to do [indiscernible] we would do. And we are having a lot of discussion about those plans, which is really good. It's good to be interactive because we both have the same goals. We want to improve compliance and we want to improve operational risk at the Company. So it's not a situation where we hand a new work and then you wait patiently at your desk for somebody to come back with the results. And here is another example of bringing on high-quality leaders. Sarah Dahlgren, who had been in charge of supervision at the New York Fed, joined us this quarter and she is responsible for our engagement with our regulators and is doing a terrific job. John McDonald : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Just wanted to follow up on Ken's question on your net interest income outlook, so as I think about, John, what you mentioned about the 59% efficiency ratio by year-end 2018 being pushed to 2019, does that mean that net interest income will not grow for the rest of the year? John R. Shrewsberry: It depends on the drivers that I mentioned. When we had previously been asked the question and responded to, could we see a 59 handle in 2018, it was before that last $300 million or $400 million worth of net interest income that we would attribute to actions that we expect that we would have to take to comply with the asset cap. And absent that $300 million to $400 million, that's a [indiscernible] number, not a revenue number, but it's interest income, it's easy to do the math. That would be the driver. So, as I said to Ken, a variety of things could happen in loan growth, deposit growth, deposit pricing, shape of the curve, Fed moves, et cetera, they are all going to have an impact on where net interest income is. But based on the forecast that we have been operating with, that $300 million to $400 million was a difference maker between a calculated estimate of an efficiency ratio with a 59 handle at the end of the year versus one that's above that. Erika Najarian : Okay. My follow up question is, in terms of \u2013 I heard you loud and clear in terms of your commitment to return more capital to shareholders, and the question I get a lot from your shareholders is, with the overhang of the outstanding signs, does that at all impact how you are thinking about your near-term buyback plans or dividends? Timothy J. Sloan: No, it doesn't, no. And I'm glad you're hearing the same things that we are, which is good. I mean, Erika, our plans, and John and I have reiterated this on a number of occasions over the last few months, is that we have an excess amount of capital to run and grow Wells Fargo and our plan is to reduce that excess over the next two to three years, and that's where we're going. John R. Shrewsberry: Yes, and the magnitude of the operating losses that we recently have been experiencing, while it's very different than what we had been experiencing previously, is provided for even in a base case capital plan because of industry results over the year. So, while we would rather not be experiencing it, it's not outsized. Erika Najarian : And just to follow up on all this, and clearly this also comes into your conversations with your shareholders, but can you give us a little bit more insight on and as much as you can on the qualitative process? So clearly there has been some debate about whether or not your Consent Order will impact a non-objection or objection on a qualitative basis and I'm wondering if the qualitative process is really as broad as the market fears it is, or is the qualitative process really more grading Wells Fargo's process and grading your data? Any insight here would be helpful. Timothy J. Sloan: The qualitative process is far-reaching. It always has been. Everybody gets a little bit of feedback every year on how they can be better. We are no different and every year we strive to be better in the following year, and this year is no different. So, it's a horizontal process, there is every measure of the inputs into a capital plan that is subject to review, consideration, comparison, and grading, and that's the basis on which we have always been compared and we expect to be compared this year. And the question, explicit or implicit, as to what that means this year given other things that are going on is one that makes us work that much harder to make sure that we have submitted a very sound plan based on a very sound process, and that's where we think we are. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. John Pancari : I want to just ask a couple of things on the expense side. For 2019, are you still confident that you could see a decline in overall operating expenses in 2019 versus 2018? And then also on the efficiency ratio side, do you expect that you could see a decline in the efficiency ratio over the full-year 2019 versus 2018? John R. Shrewsberry: Yes. Timothy J. Sloan: Double yes. And John, again, we'll provide a hard dollar number or a range like we did for this year at Investor Day, but assume that that's what you're going to hear. John R. Shrewsberry: That's a great question. Do you have any more like that? John Pancari : No, it was kind of [indiscernible]. But I guess what I'm getting at is the 55% to 59% range that you had provided previously and before some of these issues, how long do you think it takes you to get towards that midpoint again, barring new issues on the regulatory front coming up? John R. Shrewsberry: To get to the midpoint is a little bit more complicated. I mean, we'll set out our target at Investor Day for the next couple of years. Unambiguously, that's the direction that we are heading. What we're doing on dollars of expense front, which we have been explicit about for this year, we'll be explicit about for next year and we'll talk about all of the drivers that are in place to cause that happen. And then separately, there is what's happening with revenue, which is going to reflect all the things that we just talked about in terms of net interest income and then a range of drivers in noninterest income, more of which we'll talk about in Investor Day. But I sort of think about it as a distribution of potential outcomes based on what's happening with rates and interest income drivers, what's happening in all of our various businesses around noninterest income, and then what we're doing about total expense to deliver it. So, we'll try and be as transparent and helpful as we can at Investor Day, but overall, this notion of getting back to where we have historically operated or at some point through that given all the possibilities for automation, et cetera, that exist today that weren't as available a few years ago, that's our goal. Timothy J. Sloan: And let me just re-emphasize a point that John just made, and that's getting through that range. Our goal here is not to achieve the $4 billion in run rate savings that you will see in 2020 and then stop. Our goal is to have Wells Fargo be the most [efficient] [ph] company that we can be and I think that \u2013 I don't think, I know that means continuing investments but also continuing to improve the efficiency of the Company to get through that range over the next few years. John Pancari : Got it. Okay, thanks Tim. And then on the capital side, regarding this TLAC proposal from the Fed, it looks like it creates I guess ballpark $25 billion to $30 billion in additional debt that can ultimately roll off, which could be a nice positive for you. So, could you just give us your thoughts on that and how you look at that? John R. Shrewsberry: I don't know that I would sign up for $25 billion-plus that could roll off. I mean we have got excess TLAC today just based on what's happened to our RWA and we will continue to optimize our debt stack to meet the minimum requirement, at least the minimum requirement, based on where we are and where we are going with RWA. But I didn't process a big step change positive into that. We were just probably even more focused on the stress capital buffer feedback this week and what that means for the right side of our balance sheet as it relates to proposed rulemakings. John Pancari : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Where do you guys stand in terms of derisking the loan book and some of the business pruning that you have done? You talked about auto growing next year and that you are largely done there. But just in aggregate, are you kind of through the process of reviewing the businesses on loan portfolios for [indiscernible]? Timothy J. Sloan: Matt, good question. In terms of the loan portfolio, I don't think there is any other significant derisking that we need to do. The auto portfolio continues to decline not because there is really derisking going on, it's just we just have more transformation that is going on in the business and we think that loan portfolio or that business will probably start growing again. First part of next year seems reasonable based upon what we are seeing. In fact we saw other than the reclassification of the Reliable portfolio, we saw a slight improvement in the decline. But across the rest of the portfolio, I think you will continue to see a runoff of the legacy home equity book, which is performing quite well but it's pre-2009 type originations. But I wouldn't describe that as kind of running off riskier parts of that business. That's just a normal amortization. And similarly, in the legacy mortgage book, the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, the sale that we did this quarter, I wouldn't describe it as a derisking sale, I would describe it more as an [indiscernible] sale because of the dearth of those types of assets in the market and there was a really attractive bid for it and so we moved on. As it relates to the other businesses, and John may want to chime in too, but as it relates to other businesses, we are continuing to look through the entire Company to make sure that all the businesses that we've got are performing as well as they can. And if it means over time that we need to look at other businesses like insurance or Shareowner Service that could be worth more to others than they are worth to our shareholders, we'll go ahead and move forward. But I think that's going to be more of a continuing process that will take place over the next few years as opposed to one we complete by June or July or the end of the year. Matt O'Connor: Okay, it's helpful. And then just separately, your stock price continues to be under pressure and obviously some of it is going to be the Consent Order and the regulatory concern, some of it is fundamental. Just from your perspective, like is there kind of an increase in urgency in terms of whether it's trying to get more cost saves sooner or plus a little bit more on the revenue side, plus a little bit more on the buybacks? And again, I realize like market movements, they are hard to control and influence, and some of the stuff you can't control like on the regulatory side, but at the same time it has a lot of our attention, I'm sure it has your attention, and I'm just wondering if there's a little bit more that you can do a little bit faster? Timothy J. Sloan: A fair question. I mean we are clearly focused on return to our shareholders and current stock price is one measure of that. One way to think about our focus is that our focus is on the long term. As you point out, it's not on the day to day movement of the price. But clearly we have work to do. We have been very clear about the fact that we have work to do. I don't know and I don't believe we can increase the sense of urgency at the Company. Folks have been sprinting now for about last year and a half and we are going to continue to sprint for probably the next 10 years. So, I don't know if we could move a whole lot faster. But Matt, we certainly appreciate the sense of urgency, and not only from our shareholders but all of our stake holders, which is why we are transforming the Company. John R. Shrewsberry: I'd like to point out that we are already focused on continuing to deliver the type of returns on the equity that we have. By doing that, we created the powder to return capital to shareholders. We are doing that through stock buybacks. We are doing that now in a low 50s context. So, if we continue to deliver ROEs north of 12%, ROTCEs in the close to 15% range, eventually the market is going to catch up with that. Matt O'Connor: Yes, I would agree on that last point. And if I could just squeeze in, I would suggest it seems like this year could be more of a transition year, maybe even into bleeding into next year as you deal with all these issues. And I just wonder, as you provide expense guidance for next year, there still could be some lumpiness I would think in the cost, you're not going to have all the cost saves. So, I realize 2020 is far out, but giving us a little visibility into what the cost might look like on a clean basis with the capital when you bleed it down might be helpful as well. Timothy J. Sloan: Matt, do you think if we gave you an indication of 2020, you'd want 2021? Matt O'Connor: No, but I think it seems like the legacy related costs could be elevated this year, the Consent Order is going to be a drag to earnings into next year. So, my guess is, next year on a full-year basis won't be 100% clean and we'll all be wondering how much cost will further abate as these issues are resolved. So, I'm not trying to be [indiscernible] lookout for five years, but\u2026 Timothy J. Sloan: No, Matt, I was just giving you a hard time. Listen, I absolutely appreciate your question. What you want to see from us, what our shareholders want to see from us, is better efficiency and better expense discipline. It's harder to see that this year because of the pace of the investments we are making with the [indiscernible] dollars that we are saving this year. I think it will be more apparent next year and it will be even more apparent in 2020 and 2021 and so on. But I understand your point, and candidly, it was your advice among others that led us to conclude that we needed to be more specific about this [indiscernible]. We listen to you. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you for the time. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Timothy J. Sloan: Marty, you did a good job on CNBC this morning. I was watching you. Marty Mosby : Thanks, appreciate it. We had [Phil] [ph] appear, so got to do it twice. But wanted to know as you look at net interest margin, you've had a hard time getting the actual margin to start improving. This quarter we actually saw a nice pop in [indiscernible] plus no loss, a little bit [indiscernible] impact also a little bit and they count, but is this the first time that we're going to see those asset yields move up enough to offset and even pace faster than deposit rates and maybe start to see margin expansion from here? John R. Shrewsberry: Surely hope so. It depends what else is happening. So this quarter is the first time that you have seen the residual hedge ineffectiveness accounting item go through margin. That used to be entirely through noninterest income until the adoption of the new standard. So, that was another one of the things that contributed to the margin not reflecting the benefit of the increase at the short end of curve, and that is a result mostly of a big move up in long rates during the quarter, which gave rise to that accounting outcome. So, if we end up in a flatter long rate environment, so you don't have that noise running through. And as you say, they count for every quarter, then certainly it's a possibility. But the big driver again is what happens to deposit cost as Fed funds or LIBOR or other market rates move up and our assets are pricing up. We have done as an industry or at least as a company done a good job at maintaining lower cost deposits while those other items, those other benchmarks have moved up. And if that continues to be true, then you should see that. Marty Mosby : What was the basis point impact of that ineffectiveness? John R. Shrewsberry: It was $48 million. I'll do the math for you and we'll send you a note in terms of basis points. Marty Mosby : That's fine, I can do it from there. That's perfect. I can calculate that. And then, Tim, I wanted to ask you, as you are doing all these transformations and you are moving to what's going to be the new Wells Fargo, what is the kind of overriding change? I mean, is it the change of getting out of maybe some riskier businesses that you are going to actually be now kind of looking at minimizing and now having much more just the core relationships? How would you kind of bring that so we can kind of [indiscernible] into this transformation, what you eventually want to see Wells Fargo look like once you come out of it? Timothy J. Sloan: Marty, I would really center yourself on our six goals. We have been very clear in each one of those six goals that we want to be the leader in the financial services industry and we have got work to do in all of them. But that's where I would focus. What the Company looks like as we achieve those goals is really going to be a function of who our customers are, what they want, and what the competition looks like. But I would really focus on those six goals. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : I just had a couple of questions on the reserve release. I know you mentioned earlier that a lot of that was driven by the improvement in the [indiscernible] for hurricane related losses. Just wanted to see if that cleans that issue up or is there still more reserve release that could happen based on loan performance from the hurricane side? And then I had a follow up. John R. Shrewsberry: So, on the hurricane side, just for everyone's benefit, at the end of the third quarter, right after the hurricanes impacted Texas and Louisiana and then Puerto Rico had hit, we granted 90 day payment holidays to our consumer customers in those geographies so they could focus on getting their live together and not worrying about making a payment on their loans and becoming or become [indiscernible]. So, there was a ton of uncertainty because we couldn't measure delinquency or default because we had this payment holiday. That came and went and our customers got back on their schedule, their plans, and so now we have real performance and a real understanding of home loss, auto loss, insurance claims, current versus delinquent, et cetera, which gave rise to an understanding that the loss has been negligible as a result of the hurricanes, and that's why now is the right time to take down that portion of the reserve. I think that that's probably the last time you will hear us say that a reserve release or build has anything to do with hurricanes. I think it's pretty much cleared up. It's much more driven now by the size of loan book, the quality of the loan book, and what might be happening in other loan categories. And of course the most consistent, other than energy over the last couple of years, which has kind of run its course, it really has been the improvement in real estate secured related portfolios. It's been sort of the big driver at the margin I think of improvement in loan quality and the related appropriate amount of allowance. Betsy Graseck : Right. And then you mentioned that \u2013 did I hear you say correctly that all of your loan categories are in a net recovery position? John R. Shrewsberry: All of our real estate secured loan categories. So, commercial real estate, consumer real estate including second lien consumer real estate, are all in that recovery right now. Betsy Graseck : So does that drive more reserve release going forward? John R. Shrewsberry: Yes, at the margin. I mean it probably \u2013 it looks more to the path of loan price appreciation as a driver. I mean that's going to run its course because we haven't had losses in consumer real estate in a long time. So I don't think that's a big driver but it has been the driver. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And then just lastly, the outlook with, I know it's in a couple of years, but [indiscernible], and I know there's different folks that are running parallel starting this year on how reserve is likely to traject over [indiscernible] with implementation beginning in I know 2020, but next year CCAR, and I know it's a long way away from now, but next year CCAR includes [indiscernible]. So if you could just give us your sense as to how you're thinking about dealing with that? John R. Shrewsberry: So, right now we are focused first and foremost on the modelling necessary to understand what [indiscernible] looks like in business as usual. And there will be an impact, like there will be for everybody, that the required allowance for the loan portfolio will be somewhat bigger than it is today. I don't think it's a boxcar change and there is still refinement to do. There is a reasonable question in terms of what it means in stress and our own version of stress and what it means to CCAR, and we are hoping that we have a lot of productive dialog with the regulatory community before next year's CCAR to understand how they are going to be thinking about its pro cyclicality and other things as we roll into CCAR 2019. But right now, the gap, business as usual, adjustment is something that's becoming better understood. We'll begin to talk more about it with the passage of quarters as it's really, really understood and refined, and it's not going to make for a gigantic change. Betsy Graseck : Right. And it's not impacting your decisioning today on reserve? John R. Shrewsberry: No, not reserving. And importantly, we have begun to think about it in terms of our thoughts about loan structure, loan price, the credit availability, that type of reserving because it can influence how we feel about certain types of specifically longer-term loans, and those are discussions that we are having, but it hasn't driven a big change in our approach to either pricing or availability yet. Betsy Graseck : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead. Nancy Bush : John, a question for you, just about the whole interest rate yield curve environment right now, because I'm trying to fit us all in with what you said about your sensitivity to long rates, et cetera, I mean how do you look at the flat yield curve, what do you do if it persists, can you just sort of address this whole weird rate environment that we seem to be in right now and the panic that seems to be building up around it? John R. Shrewsberry: So, if the curve gets flatter from here because the short end comes up and the long end remains anchored, then we actually do better, we make more and more asset sensitive to front end of the curve and we'll make more money as a result of it. We would make even more money if it was a parallel shift in the long and move up also. And I guess one nuance to that is, businesses like mortgage will do better on the origin nation front if longer rates remain at about where they are today versus be in the move about 3%, there is some question about affordability in some markets and so originations come down. But the reinvestment activity that we have in our investment portfolio at higher rates is something that we would miss if long and doesn't move up from where it is today. But very specifically, if it stays put and the short end keeps coming up, we are still improving in terms of our earnings profile as a result of that. Nancy Bush : Are you building or thinking anything? I mean there has been apparently a slight inversion at the short end of the curve that's sending everybody into panic and it seemed money market related issue. Can you just give us a little bit more understanding around that? John R. Shrewsberry: Sure. So there is a lot more issuance going on at the front end, both by the government because they are issuing at the short end and they have got a lot to do because they are going to have even more financing as a result of depending on what happens with the tax related impact of tax reform, but therein as a big issuer you've got others in as big CP issuers and that's a result of money market reform. There are fewer takeouts for that to convert it into cash equivalents for retail and others. And so, investors at that point in the curve have a little bit more power. So, yields are up. Incidentally, that feels like the driver of a piece of the LIBOR-OIS disconnect that I think you are referring to. It's technical, it's supply driven from issuers in the short end. Nancy Bush : Okay. But you are not concerned about the environment right now and don't see the flat yield curve as necessarily indicative of anything? John R. Shrewsberry: No, I mean I think if we didn't have some of the trade-related and other political dynamics that can allow people to imagine that there could be economic problems as a result of that, it's probably the longer end of the curve would have adjusted up even more than where it is today. But that's speculative, but that's my take. Nancy Bush : All right, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : First, I just wanted to clarify a point on your expense guidance rate, so the 53.5 to 54.5. That includes I guess $600 million of typical operating losses and this quarter you had $668 million. So, effectively any incremental operating losses from here when I [indiscernible] to your guidance, we should basically exclude that. I just want to make sure I'm understanding puts and takes around the guidance. John R. Shrewsberry: That's right. Our sort of ambient run rate of operating losses for fraud and bank robberies and things like that is $150 million a quarter. And so, what we have in giving that guidance we have basically accounted for that. As you pointed out, we have achieved that in the first quarter as a result of litigation related costs. Saul Martinez : Got it, okay. I guess a broader question, John, you mentioned your stock will take care of itself if you can continue to do 15% ROTCEs and 12% [indiscernible] 120 basis points ROAs, and I suspect we will hear more about this at your Investor Day, but this quarter also did have a lot of noise in it, maybe net-net been more positive than negative, but when we compare you to your peers, you are no longer sort of at the top of your peer group in number of performance metrics, and I guess the question is, how important is it to be in the top of your peer group and is it still something that is feasible and is it still something that is important or do you really need to get past your issues, all the issues that have risen that becomes a primary goal or should be a primary goal of the Company? John R. Shrewsberry: Yes, it's one of the six primary goals in terms of shareholder value in particular, and we absolutely expect, especially among G-SIB peers because of the capital structure that we all have that we would be at the high end of the performance range. So the north of 12.375% ROE this quarter and 14.75% of ROTCE with a 64% of business [indiscernible] ratio, and like we are as clear as we can be that our expenses should be substantially lower, will drive us to appreciably higher returns. Also, we are carrying 200 basis points of capital above what we think is appropriate for a company with our risk profile. So, both of those things as rectified should return us to the very high end of the range and we think that's appropriate given the scope of our business, the risk profile of our business, the scale we have in the business that we are in, and those are crystal-clear goals. Saul Martinez : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Tim, can you give us maybe some color? Clearly we know about the sales practices and the problems that you guys are wrestling with, with these issues. Subsequent to the discovery of your sales practice issues, you discovered some other issues in different lines of businesses. And if I recall, Wealth Management is now under some sort of investigation. Are you comfortable, are you confident enough to be able to say that you guys have looked in every corner, nook and cranny that you are now \u2013 there shouldn't be any more incremental discoveries of issues that may bring regulators to look harder or is that just [indiscernible]? Timothy J. Sloan: We certainly had a thorough look in every nook and cranny in the Company and we are continuing on that process. And I think, Gerard, one of the lessons learnt for us candidly over the last few years is that we should have been doing a better job of that when we were performing quite well in the prior years, and we are not going to make that mistake again, so that we are going to continue to raise the bar on ourselves over time. But in terms of declaring victory and walking ahead, we are not at that spot right now. I think we are going to know that when we [indiscernible] in 6 to 12 months after it happens. And we are making a lot of progress, but as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have got some challenges that we are dealing with right now, including the reason that we described our results today as preliminary, and we take those issues very seriously. But having said all that, we have made a tremendous amount of progress in terms of transforming the Company. And so, I think we are very far along in the journey, to answer your question specifically. But in terms of declaring victory and walking ahead, we are not quite there yet. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, thank you. And I apologize if you addressed this, I jumped on the call a bit late. On your Slide 5 where you guys talk about the noninterest income being down in the quarter, you talk about the impact, the full quarter impact of the customer-friendly changes, including the Overdraft Rewind product. Can you give us some more color about what's going-on on the consumer deposit fees? And then second, you also talked about the higher earnings credit rate for commercial customers. Was that just interest-rate related as rates go higher, they get a higher credit, or was there something else in there? John R. Shrewsberry: In terms of the second part of your question, that's exactly right, that's just the way to pay commercial customers for their deposits by charging them less for treasury management services. And the first part of your question is really, it's a very big one. Part of the reason that our retail deposit franchise is as large as it is and as low-cost as it is, is because customers have a great experience with the whole range of capabilities and the whole experience. Part of that is what they pay for monthly checking, if anything, and most of them don't pay anything, and part of it is what happens if things go wrong. And so, we have made great strides. Overdraft Rewind, for those of you who don't remember, is the capability where if somebody has direct deposit with us and they would overdraft on any given night, but on the next day their direct deposit hits and it covers it, then we don't charge them, we don't process what happened the night before as an overdraft. Similarly, we have been sending out tens of millions of alerts to people to help to remind them before they would overdraft that they have got little balance so they can handle their affairs appropriately and not get charged. So, we lose revenue as a result of that. We lose overdraft fees. It costs us hundreds of millions of dollars. But as a result, [indiscernible] are happy with their relationship with Wells Fargo, we end up with a large and low-cost deposit base. I think of it as inseparable in terms of the value of deposits versus what we are missing in overdraft fees. We are not going to grow our [indiscernible] greatness as the company that we are by charging people more for overdrafts, and if we can maintain and grow those relationships by helping them avoid them when they can, then that's probably better for us both in the long-term. Timothy J. Sloan: And that's a really important point that we are listening to our customers, and one of the themes that we hear from them is, and that is help us manage our finances better by helping us give them better information about how to manage their finances. And that's just fundamental to the long-term investments we have made in terms of specifically the two improvements that John mentioned for our consumer deposit customers. And in short run, it has an impact on revenues. On the long run, what we are seeing is we are seeing a growth in deposits, a growth in primary checking accounts and better customer service and loyalty scores, and I think that's a real indication of the progress that we're making across the entire platform. And again, it just reinforces how we are thinking about the long-term sustainability and the progress of the Company. So, I want to thank you all for your questions. Again, I know it was a very busy day. I thought the questions were very good and we are going to continue to listen to all the advice that you provide to us, and for our team members that are mentioning today, I want to thank you for all of your hard work and effort as you continue to transform Wells Fargo. Have a good rest of your day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Marlin Mosby - Vining Sparks Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Tim Sloan. Timothy Sloan : Thanks John. Good morning and I want to thank you all for joining us today. I know it's a busy morning for many of you. We earned $5.2 billion in the second quarter or $0.98 per diluted common share. Our results included net discrete income tax expense of $0.10 per share. John is going to provide more details on this income tax expense as well as other noteworthy items that impacted our results later in the call. I want to focus my comments on providing an update on the transformational changes that we're making to build a better, stronger company for our customers, team members, communities and shareholders. These efforts include progress on our six goals.  We've committed to transform how we manage risk at Wells Fargo, and our goal is not only to meet, but exceed regulatory expectations so that we have the best risk management in the industry. We have a strong track record of managing many of our risks, and our 2018 CCAR results and credit quality are just two examples. However, we have to improve how we manage other risks, such as compliance and operational risk, to address challenges, such as those we'll discuss later in the call on our foreign exchange and trust businesses. As I mentioned at Investor Day, we're pleased that Mandy Norton has started as our new Chief Risk Officer, and she's already having a positive impact. While we have more work to accomplish, I'm confident we'll achieve our goal in risk management. We're also focused on new ways to create a better customer experience. This includes a number of changes that help our customers manage their accounts by leveraging data and technology. In June, we launched a customer pilot of Control Tower, a digital experience aimed at providing our customers visibility and control of their connections to their payment accounts. Last year, we introduced automatic zero balance alerts to online banking customers, and we now send an average of more than 30 million zero balance and customer-specified balance alerts a month. We're continuing to make changes to better serve our customers who come in our branches. In the second quarter, we completed the rollout of our customer relationship view tool, which helps our tellers and bankers have more value-added conversations and refer customers to specialists to meet more complex needs. These conversations are improving the customer experience, and we believe they'll further improve customer retention and deepen relationships over time, which leads to growth. We've also continued to create value for our customers through our focus on innovation. In the first quarter, we launched our online mortgage application, which grew to 23% of all retail applications in June. In the second quarter, we introduced iPrint biometric log-on capabilities for our commercial customers, making it easier for them to do business. Our small business banking deposit customers can now apply and, if approved, immediately accept card payments and purchase processing equipment through one convenient online application at Wells Fargo Merchant Services. And we rolled out simplified, standard Merchant Services pricing for eligible small business customers, too. We've also announced the newly enhanced Propel Card, one of the richest, no-annual-fee rewards cards in the industry. We believe our credit card business has significant opportunities for growth, and we are excited to start taking applications for the card next week. As part of our goal of making a positive contribution to the communities we serve, which includes promoting environmental sustainability, we recently announced a commitment to provide $200 billion in financing to sustainable businesses and projects by 2030. And the millions of hours our team members volunteer each year contributed to Wells Fargo recently being named as one of the 50 most community-minded companies in the U.S. from the Points of Light organization. We also want to be a leader in team member engagement, and we've made many changes to make Wells Fargo a better place to work. These efforts are reflected in continued declines in voluntary team member attrition, which -- with second quarter voluntary attrition at its lowest level in over five years. We've also had success in hiring strong talent from outside of Wells Fargo. In addition to our new Chief Risk Officer, we also hired Lisa Frazier to lead our Innovation Group. Lisa has extensive experience in digital disruption, customer experience and product innovation. And earlier this week, David Galloreese, who was most recently at Walmart, joined us as the new Head of Human Resources. As part of our goal of delivering long-term shareholder value, we're committed to returning more capital to our shareholders. This commitment was demonstrated in our recent CCAR results, which included an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend rate in the third quarter 2018 to $0.43 per share, subject to board approval, and up to $24.5 billion of gross common stock repurchases during the next four quarters. The shareholder returns included in our 2018 Capital Plan are approximately 70% higher than our previous four-quarter capital actions.  Our ability to significantly increase our returns demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model, our sound financial risk management practices and our strong capital position, which is a result of the capital we built in recent years through continued stable earnings and a lower level of risk-weighted assets. We're also committed to operating more efficiently, and we are on track to achieve our targeted $4 billion of expense reductions by the end of 2019.  In the second quarter, we also launched our reestablished marketing effort, which is the largest advertising campaign in our history. The campaign acknowledges our past issues, shows how we're moving forward, and highlights the changes happening and continues to happen at Wells Fargo. The reaction to the campaign has been positive, and advertising awareness has continued to increase. As our ads highlight, our team members are focusing on transforming Wells Fargo into a better company for all of our stakeholders, and I am confident that we're on the right path.  John will now discuss our financial results in more detail. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As Tim mentioned, we had a number of noteworthy items this quarter, which we've highlighted on Slide 2 of our supplement. Our earnings of $5.2 billion included $481 million net discrete income tax expense. This expense mostly related to state income taxes and was driven by the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling in South Dakota versus Wayfair. While the ruling addressed whether a state can require an out-of-state seller to collect sales taxes or use taxes even when the seller lacks an in-state physical presence, it has an income tax implication as well. Following the ruling, some of our affiliated entities may be considered to be taxable based on an economic presence in the state, even if they have no physical presence in the state. And while our effective income tax rate increased to 25.9% in the second quarter from this expense, we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the remainder of '18 to be approximately 19%, excluding the impact of any other future discrete items. Our results also included $619 million of operating losses primarily related to non-litigation expense for previously disclosed matters, which I'll highlight in more detail in the next page. We had a $479 million gain on the sale of $1.3 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans; $214 million of other-than-temporary impairment on the announced sale of Wells Fargo's Asset Management 65% ownership stake in The Rock Creek Group; and $150 million reserve release reflecting strong overall portfolio credit performance and lower balances. As we're highlighting on Page 3, operating losses in the second quarter were driven by a customer remediation for previously disclosed matters, all of which have been referenced in our recent 10-Q and 10-Q filings. I'll spend a moment updating you on these matters. The foreign exchange business has been under new leadership since October of '17. And after substantially completing an assessment with the assistance of a third party, the business is currently in the process of revising and implementing new policies, practices and procedures, including those related to pricing. In the second quarter, we accrued $171 million in customer remediation and rebate costs. We've been conducting an ongoing review related to certain of Wells Fargo's historical FX pricing practices. $31 million was accrued in the second quarter to remediate customers that may have received pricing inconsistent with commitments made to those customers. In addition, as part of our efforts to make things right and rebuild trust, we've examined rates historically charged to FX customers over a seven-year period and set aside $140 million in the second quarter to rebate customers where historic pricing, while consistent with contracts entered into with those customers, doesn't conform to our recently implemented standards and pricing. With respect to fee calculations in certain fiduciary and custody accounts in Wealth and Investment Management, we've determined that there have been instances of incorrect fees being applied to certain assets and accounts, resulting in both overcharges and undercharges to customers. In the second quarter, we accrued $114 million to refund customers that may have been overcharged at any time during the past seven years. The third-party review of customer accounts is ongoing to determine the extent of any additional necessary remediation, including with respect to additional accounts not yet reviewed. During the second quarter, we also accrued additional amounts for remediation related to past practices in our automobile lending business, including insurance-related products, and related to mortgage interest rate lock extensions. We believe remediation for mortgage interest rate lock is now substantially complete. In June, we received final approval on the class-action lawsuit settlement concerning improper sales practices, and the claims filing period for the settlement closed on July 7. We had previously accrued for the amount of this settlement. These actions are important steps in our efforts to rebuild trust. Turning to Page 4. As Tim highlighted, improving risk management across Wells Fargo is a top priority, including our compliance and operational risk management program. And we're focused on satisfying the requirements of the Federal Reserve, OCC and CFPB consent orders. However, the asset cap related to the Federal Reserve's consent order has not impacted our ability to grow our core lending and deposit taking businesses. The decline in the balance sheet in the second quarter primary reflected lower deposits, driven by seasonality as well as commercial and Wealth and Investment Management customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments. I'll describe deposit trends in more detail later on the call. I'll be highlighting the income statement drivers on Page 5 throughout the call.  So turning to loans on Page 6. Average loans declined $6.9 billion from the first quarter. The decline in loan balances was not related to any actions we took in connection with the consent order, but was driven by opportunistic loan sales and continued reductions in auto, consumer real estate and commercial real estate. I'll highlight the specific drivers starting on Page 7. Commercial loans declined $291 million from the first quarter, despite C&I loans increasing $1.9 billion on growth in our Asset Backed Finance, Middle Market Banking and commercial capital business. The growth was more than offset by continued declines in Commercial Real Estate, primarily due to lower originations reflecting continued credit discipline and competitive highly liquid financing markets as well as ongoing paydowns on existing and acquired loans. Of note, Wholesale Banking revolving line utilization has been substantially unchanged compared with a year ago at approximately 40%. Consumer loans declined $2.8 billion from the first quarter. First mortgage loans increased $343 million as high-quality, nonconforming loan origination growth was partially offset by $2.3 billion of lower Pick-a-Pay mortgage loans, including the sales of $1.3 billion of PCI loans. In addition, $507 million of nonconforming mortgage loan originations that otherwise would have been included in this portfolio were designated as held for sale in anticipation of future issuance of RMBS securities. Junior lien mortgage loans continued to decline as paydowns more than offset new originations. However, junior lien mortgage originations grow in the second quarter, up 15% from a year ago. Credit card loans increased $581 million from the first quarter. Balances increased $1.4 billion or 4% from a year ago. New account -- new accounts grew 7% from a year ago, driven by higher digital channel acquisitions. 43% of new card accounts were originated through digital channels in the second quarter. We expect credit card balances to continue to grow, bolstered by the launch of our new Propel Card next week and our continued focus on digital channel acquisition. Auto loans were down $1.9 billion from the first quarter due to expected continued runoff. Auto originations have stabilized over the past three quarters. And we're positioned for originations to start to grow, and we currently expect portfolio balances to begin to grow by mid-2019. Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $376 million from the first quarter and included $68 million of loans transferred to held for sale as a result of previously announced branch divestitures. Balances in student lending and personal loans and lines continued to decline, but originations of personal loans and lines were up 8% from a year ago and reached their highest level since the third quarter of 2016. Average deposits declined $25.9 billion for the first quarter, driven by lower commercial deposits, including $13.5 billion from actions taken in response to the asset cap. Average consumer and small business banking deposits declined $1.4 billion as higher average Community Banking deposits were more than offset by lower deposits in Wealth and Investment Management as customers allocated more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments.  Our average deposit cost increased six basis points from the first quarter and was up 19 basis points from a year ago compared with a 75 basis point change in the Fed funds rate. The increase in our average deposit cost was driven by increases in commercial and Wealth and Investment Management deposit rates, while rates paid on consumer and small business banking deposits have not yet meaningfully responded to rate movements. Deposit betas continue to outperform our expectations. But as we highlighted at Investor Day, the cumulative beta over the last year was above our experience for the first 100 basis point move. And the initial lags in repricing are expected to ultimately catch up to our historical experience. On Page 10, we provide details on period-end deposits, which declined $34.8 billion from the first quarter. There's typically a seasonal decline in deposits in the second quarter, which includes the impact of customer tax payments. And deposits were down $19.6 billion on a linked quarter basis a year ago. Wholesale Banking deposits declined $23.6 billion in the second quarter. Approximately 40% or $9.7 billion of this reduction was in financial institution deposits. As Neal Blinde, our Treasurer, discussed at Investor Day, financial institution deposits are by far our highest-cost deposits and our highest beta category. The decline in these deposits reflected temporary high levels of liquidity from the commercial payments business at the end of March as well as $3.9 million in actions taken in response to the asset cap. Wholesale Banking deposits also declined due to seasonality and commercial customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments. Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $20.2 billion from the first quarter, driven by seasonality as well as customers allocating more cash to alternative, higher-rate liquid investments. These declines were partially offset by $6.2 billion of higher Corporate Treasury deposits, including brokerage CDs as well as $2.8 billion of higher mortgage escrow balances. Net interest income in the second quarter increased $303 million from the first quarter. The drivers of the increase included $120 million less negative impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting; approximately $105 million from balance sheet mix, repricing and variable income, largely driven by the net impact of rates and spreads; and approximately $80 million from one additional day in the quarter. Our NIM increased nine basis points to 2.93%, driven by a reduction in the proportion of lower-yielding assets, a less negative impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting, and the net benefit of rate -- interest rate and spread movements. Noninterest income declined $752 million from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage revenue and a reduction of $210 million from businesses we sold during the past year, which also reduced expenses. Noninterest income declined $684 million from the first quarter.  While deposit service charges had minimal impact to linked-quarter trends, they were down 9% from a year ago, so I want to provide more insight into these fees. I've highlighted in prior quarters the customer-friendly initiatives we've launched over the past year to help our consumer customers reduce fees, including Overdraft Rewind, which is an industry-leading feature that's helped over 1.3 million customers avoid overdraft charges. These initiatives were largely reflected in the amount of deposit service charges in the first quarter, so they didn't have a significant impact linked quarter. We've also enhanced our efforts to help customers minimize standard monthly service fees through activities, such as direct deposit or debit card usage. Approximately 90% of our consumer checking customers do not pay a monthly fee, which is consistent with our goal of having more primary consumer checking customers. It's also important to note that 46% of deposit service charges in the second quarter are from wholesale customers and are related to the Treasury Management fees they pay for services we provide to them. As market interest rates have risen over the past year, the earnings credit rate on noninterest-bearing deposits has modestly reduced these fees for wholesale customers, which were down $25 million from a year ago. We would expect this trend to continue if interest rates continue to rise. As a reminder, Treasury Management fees apply to noninterest-bearing deposit accounts, so the reduction in fees is an alternative to our paying interest. Mortgage banking revenue declined $164 million from the first quarter. Servicing income declined $62 million driven by higher prepayments. Residential mortgage originations increased $7 billion from the first quarter, but revenue declined $102 million due to a lower production margin. The production margin declined to 77 basis points as a result of increased pricing competition in both retail and correspondent channels. And given current market pricing trends, we would expect our production margin to remain near the current level in the third quarter. Gains from equity sales declined $488 million from the first quarter on lower unrealized gains and the impairment related to the announced sale of our ownership stake in RockCreek that I highlighted earlier. Other income was down $117 million from the first quarter. Our results in the second quarter included a $479 million gain on the sales of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans compared with a gain of $643 million from sales in the first quarter. Partially offsetting these declines was growth in card and other fees. Card fees increased $93 million from the first quarter on higher credit and debit card purchase volume. Other fees increased $46 million and included higher Commercial Real Estate brokerage commissions. Turning to expenses on Page 13. Expenses declined $1.1 billion from the first quarter, largely driven by lower operating losses and a decline from seasonally higher first quarter personnel expenses.  Starting on Page 14, I'll explain our expense drivers in more detail. Compensation and benefits expense declined $447 million from the first quarter, which had seasonally higher personnel expense. Second quarter expenses included a full quarter impact from salary increases, higher deferred compensation and severance expense. Revenue-related expenses increased $59 million primarily from incentive compensation in Wells Fargo Securities and in home lending. Third-party services increased $151 million from higher contract services and legal expense. The $819 million decline in nondiscretionary, running-the-business expense was driven by lower operating losses on lower litigation accruals. The increase in discretionary running-the-business expense was driven by higher advertising expenses related to the launch of our Re-Established campaign. Finally, infrastructure expenses declined $62 million from the first quarter, which is typically elevated equipment expense due to contract renewals. On Page 15, we show the drivers of the $441 million year-over-year increase in expenses. Compensation and benefits expense increased $265 million, primarily due to salary increases and higher severance, partially offset by the impact of the sale of Wells Fargo Insurance Services, which drove FTE reductions in Wholesale Banking. Our total FTEs were down 2% from a year ago and also reflected lower FTE in Community Banking and Consumer Lending.  The increase in expenses was also driven by $269 million in higher operating losses, primarily related to the customer remediation from previously disclosed matters that I highlighted earlier. These increases were partially offset by lower revenue-related and third-party services expense. We remain on track to achieve both our targeted $4 billion of expense reductions by the end of '19 and our expected range of $53.5 billion to $55.4 billion of expenses for 2018. As a reminder, our expected range of expenses for '18 includes approximately $600 million of typical operating losses, but excludes any outside litigation and remediation accruals and penalties. Turning to our segments on Page 16. Community Banking earnings increased $583 million from the first quarter, driven by lower operating losses, partially offset by higher income taxes from the net discrete income tax expense in the second quarter. On Page 17, we provide the Community Banking metrics. Teller and ATM transactions declined 5% from a year ago, reflecting continued customer migration to virtual channels, while digital secure sessions increased 17% from a year ago. In the second quarter, we consolidated 56 branches, and we're on track to consolidate approximately 300 branches this year. Additionally, we announced plans to divest 52 branches in Indiana, Ohio, Michigan and part of Wisconsin.  Primary consumer checking customers have grown year-over-year for three consecutive quarters. In the second quarter, we continue to have improvements in primary customer retention. And growth in new checking customers overall was driven by digital, with 12% of new checking customers acquired from the digital channel. Growth in new checking customers also reflected the benefit of ongoing marketing initiatives. On Page 18, we highlight strong growth in credit and debit card purchase volume. General-purpose credit card purchase volume was up 7% from a year ago, and debit card purchase volume was up 9%. For the second consecutive year, we were ranked the number one debit card issuer by Nilson by both purchase volume and number of transactions. Both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with most recent visit survey scores declined in the second quarter, which was driven by several factors, including recent events and a risk-based policy change affecting individuals making cash deposits into an account on which they're not a signer. Turning to Page 19. Wholesale Banking earnings declined $240 million from the first quarter, which included a $202 million gain on the sale of Wells Fargo Shareowner Services. Results in the second quarter included $171 million in operating losses related to the foreign exchange business, as I mentioned earlier. Wealth and Investment Management earnings declined $269 million from the first quarter, driven by the impairment from the announced sale of our ownership stake in RockCreek and $114 million of operating losses related to fee calculations in certain fiduciary and custody accounts, as I also mentioned earlier. Turning to Page 21. Our credit card -- our strong credit results continued with our loss rate in the second quarter declining to 26 basis points of average loans, a historically low level. For the third consecutive quarter, all of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position. Nonperforming assets declined $305 million from the first quarter, the ninth consecutive quarter of declines. We had a $150 million reserve release, reflecting strong credit performance and lower loan balances. Turning to Page 22. Our estimated Common Equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in was 12%. We returned $4 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the second quarter, including entering into a $1 billion forward repurchase transaction, which settled this week in the third quarter. Our 2018 Capital Plan, which includes up to $24.5 billion of gross common stock repurchases, reflects our goal of reducing our CET1 ratio to our internal target of 10% over the next 2 to 3 years. In the past, our quarterly common stock repurchases have been relatively evenly distributed over the 4-quarter period of a capital plan. However, given our high level of excess capital, our current plan, subject to market conditions and management discretion, is to use approximately 60% of the gross repurchase capacity under our capital plan during the second half of 2018. In summary, our second quarter results continued to reflect strong credit quality, liquidity and capital. We grew net interest income, both linked quarter and year-over-year. We remain on track to meet our expense reduction expectations. And as Tim highlighted, we continue to transform Wells Fargo and make progress on our six goals.  And we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : John, I was wondering, in terms of the net interest income, is the $12.5 billion that you did this quarter, is that a fair jumping-off point for us to think about going forward? And what would be the puts and takes for the ability to grow NII from that level that we should keep in mind? John Shrewsberry : So I think it's a good jumping-off point. And I think the biggest puts and takes are going to be what happens with both deposit and loan growth coming from separate drivers; what happens with, in particular, retail deposit betas, which as I pointed out have been outperforming our -- or the industry-modeled expectations and past performance; and then maybe, although not immediately, what happens at the long end of the curve as we continue to redeploy excess liquidity in our bond portfolio. And I guess importantly also, hedge ineffectiveness accounting now runs through interest income, or a portion of it does. So at the -- that was the biggest driver in this quarter-to-quarter. So that will be up or down from quarter-to-quarter, a little harder to model. But the first items that I mentioned are the ones that are going to drive the outcome. John McDonald : And in terms of excess liquidity, do you feel like you have a fair amount now relative to what you need for regulatory purposes, and it's just a question of the pricing and rates available that dictates how much you put to work? John Shrewsberry : I think that's right. Our liquidity coverage ratios and other key regulatory measures of liquidity are very strong, and we have calculated excess that could be put to work. So for example, if loan demand were to pick up, that would be no problem to satisfy. And similarly from -- one question that's -- I think we've talked about it before, but this notion of, in the old days, the difference between cash and duration of the bond portfolio, there's a bigger pickup for the risk that you're taking. These days, there's less of a pickup because the curve is so much flatter. So the -- being patient as we sit here and wait for better entry points doesn't cost us as much as it used to, because we're earning so much more in cash. And then lastly, of course, the sensitivity of OCI is something that we certainly model and stress and think about in terms of what happens at any point, if there's a big, big move up in the long end in the short term. But that shouldn't prevent us from continuing to redeploy if long rates were higher, as we have excess liquidity building, or if we've got the existing bond portfolio amortizing or paying down. John McDonald : Okay. And then on the loan growth side, the two areas that you're really experiencing runoff. Auto, it sounds like you might have pushed out the time frame for that to start growing until mid-next year. But do you expect the pace of its decline to slow so you're not losing $2 billion a quarter or seeing to decline? And then also on home equity, should that pace start slowing? John Shrewsberry : I don't think home equity is going to slow. Because even if we're up 15% year-over-year, which we're excited about, those are relatively small numbers. The modern-era home equity business just isn't as robust as the runoff from the, call it, the pre-crisis, now amortizing home equity portfolio. And in auto, I think we're flat, we'll be flat to up in originations. It's just a question of how fast we're amortizing in the more seasoned portfolio. So those -- where those lines cross, whether it was late this year, early next year or a little bit later into next year is hard to judge, unless we'll see quarter by quarter what the originations are. But I would say that we're happy that we sort of stabilized and are now viewing the origination path as growing. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I have a question on the capital return. Obviously, very strong result for you in CCAR. You're still the bank with the most excess capital after the test and the results. Could you just give us a sense as to how you came up with the ask that you did? And how you think about deploying the rest of the excess capital? Would you go for a top-up this year? Or does that have to wait until the consent order gets lifted? Your thoughts on all there. John Shrewsberry : Yes. So we're very happy with the results. And as we've described, we're on a path to get down toward our 10% target over the next 2 to 3 years. And this is a big first step in doing that. I mentioned that our approach to repurchases will be a little bit more front-end loaded than it has historically, because as you described, we have so much excess. I think it's unlikely that we would be going for a top-up. We are -- the way we approach our ask is by conducting a rigorous assessment of our risks, developing a scenario that we think is appropriately severely adverse, and then measuring our earnings stream through that scenario and judging how much room we have to take capital out. And in our own calculations, we think the approach that we took got us to the right level of capital to -- or gets us to the right level of capital to run our business. We'll see what the next few quarters or even several quarters deliver in terms of RWA growth and earnings growth or earnings volatility or anything like that. But I wouldn't count on a midstream bite at the apple, because we're going to be so busy executing on the capital plan that we have. Conditions could change, but that's my assessment today. Timothy Sloan : Yes, Betsy, just to add on to John's comment. I mean, I think a 70% increase from last year was -- we were really pleased with that. But I think it's really important to emphasize that when you think about capital policy, you really can't think about them as short term. You got to think about it over the long term. We -- the CCAR plans that we provide to the Fed are over a multiyear period. We're managing this business over a multiyear period. That's one of the reasons why John and I and Neal have been talking about getting down to our 10%-ish level over the next 2 to 3 years. And so we're going to continue to manage capital in an appropriate way, thinking on a multiyear period. So I want to reemphasize what John said, and that is I think the likelihood that we're going to take any sort of additional action this year is remote. John Shrewsberry : One more thing just, Betsy, to mention is that we're also in the middle of the NPR period, or the comment period on the NPR for the stress capital buffer. And we don't know -- the industry doesn't know yet exactly how that's going to land, whether it's going to produce a lot more expected year-to-year volatility. There's not a lot of transparency currently in how those outcomes are calculated by the regulatory community. So there's work to do there, and that's a little bit of an overhang, I think, for everybody until it's better understood. Betsy Graseck : Got it. No, that's helpful color. The follow-up I had is just on the allocation to the divi versus the buyback. And on the divi, do you feel like the current payout ratio is pretty much as high as it gets? Is that maxed out? Or is -- do you feel like there's room for that to rise a little bit from here? Timothy Sloan : No, not at all. I mean, we're hopeful that it's going to rise over the next few years, a function of hopefully higher payout rates and then also more earnings. Betsy Graseck : So dividend up on an absolute basis, yes. But even on a payout ratio, you think that could move higher. Timothy Sloan : Yes. John Shrewsberry : I think it's [indiscernible] to move higher. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill Robert Siefers : I appreciate the commentary on sort of the movements within the loan portfolio. I guess, just as you guys see it, I know there's at least some concern that balances are just sort of leaving, to a certain extent, involuntarily. But I guess, as you guys see it, you've been pretty clear on whether CRE or auto, those intentional runoff. On an aggregate basis, how do you see the runoff being sort of conscious versus involuntary as you guys look at things from the inside? Timothy Sloan : It really depends on the portfolio, Scott, so it's hard to describe it on an aggregate basis. But clearly, the pace of the involuntary runoff as it relates to some of the Pick-a-Pay as well as home equity will continue. I mean, the underlying consumer real estate portfolio is performing very well. We were pleased to see, as John mentioned, originations in home equity pick up on a sequential-quarter basis and year-over-year, which was good. And we hadn't seen that in a while. So we're pleased with that. I think that -- and to emphasize, as John said, in the auto business, I think we've seen the inflection, plus or minus. And we should be able to grow originations from here. Where the lines cross, as John mentioned earlier in terms of growing the overall portfolio, it's likely to happen in the -- sometime in the first half of next year, not 100% certain when. We'll continue to look at the Pick-a-Pay portfolio. And to the extent that there are opportunities to sell it at very attractive prices, which is what we've done over the last couple of quarters, we'll continue to do that. On the origination side, I think we're going to continue to kind of be the Wells Fargo that's been around for decades, and that is that we're going to underwrite in an appropriate way. And that means that in some portfolios, we get a little bit of a headwind, like we've seen in Commercial Real Estate. But gosh, we've only seen that hundreds of times in our history, and so we'll get through that. So overall, I think we're feeling good about the areas that we can control in terms of growing the portfolio. And credit card is pretty interesting. When you look at the growth that we've seen year-over-year, it's been about 4% with this new card. We expect that to be higher, which is good. So I know it's a long-winded answer to your question and more granular. But I think overall, we've really exed the home equity and some of the continued runoff in the residential mortgage portfolio. We're feeling good about growth over time. Robert Siefers : Okay. That's perfect. And if I could switch to mortgage business for just a second. I mean, that seems to be proving to be maybe a more challenging quarter than we would have thought, even with the anticipation of some softness. I wonder if you can speak to sort of competitive dynamics. I think we all might have hoped that maybe some excess capacity would rationalize itself a little more quickly. Doesn't seem to be happening, at least this quarter. So any top-level thoughts you have there would be helpful. Timothy Sloan : Yes, I'll start. John, jump in. I think historically when you look at periods of overcapacity in the mortgage business, the rationalization doesn't naturally clearly occur in the second and the third quarter because those are the quarters where you see the most originations. So my guess, and it's just a guess, is that we will probably see more rationalization in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year if the same level of demand for first mortgages continues. But again, this is, as you know, it's a cyclical business. We've seen this before. We'll see it again. I think the real benefit from our model, unlike maybe a monoline mortgage-only originator, is we've got the balance sheet product. We've got the for-sale product. We've got a servicing business, and then we provide financing in our wholesale business to mortgage originators. So having that diversified business model is really helpful when you're going through a period of overcapacity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Going back to what you said to Betsy, Tim, about hopefully more earnings, I just wanted to ask about how we should think about the fee outlook ex mortgage. So I think we appreciate the cyclicality of that business. But there has also been significant volatility in that -- in fee income, even if you exclude mortgage. And as we think about stabilizing earnings for Wells Fargo over the next two years, this has ranged anywhere between $32 billion to $35 billion. How should we think about fees ex mortgage? Timothy Sloan : Yes. So there's always going to be volatility in some of the gains from equity securities, trading assets and the like, so I'm going to set that aside for a minute. Some of the volatility that you've seen in our fee line has also been from the sale of certain businesses like the commercial insurance business. And that's onetime, so I'd factor that out. I think that the proactive decision that we made, the consumer friendly decision that we made really hit our -- and impacted our service charges on deposit accounts, which were down 9% year-over-year. What you're seeing now from the first to the second quarter is a moderation of that impact. And so that's one line item I would point to and say, my gosh, it's probably going to be growing over time from here. May not exactly happen in the third quarter, but probably growing over time from here. That's a big impact that in terms of the math that you just described, I think our expectation is that trust and investment fees will continue to grow. We had a nice quarter this quarter in Investment Banking. That was terrific. And then on the card side, you've seen really strong growth in cards. And again, we're excited about the new Propel Card, which should drive that. So hopefully that's a little bit more granularity for you, but there's no question that as it relates to mortgage, the net gains from originations have been under some pressure. Erika Najarian : And as we think about -- I appreciate that. And for your peers of a similar size because you have larger investment banking and trading businesses, often investors expect a more sensitive flex to the expense base in terms of the relationship to fees. And I'm wondering, as we think about either hitting the lower band or upper band of your fee outlook, how should we think about the flex of expenses? In other words, if fees just continue to disappoint, is there a commensurate compensation benefit or a lower compensation? Or it just doesn't work that way in your model? Timothy Sloan : No, it works that way in our model, and it needs to work that way in our model. If we're not generating revenues, we need to reduce expenses. And Investment Banking in the first quarter -- or in the second quarter, that was not the experience we had. But I think Michael DeVito and Mary Mack are doing a good job in terms of managing the expense levels in the mortgage business. And if -- you've got to plan for the environment you're in, hope it gets better, but certainly you need to make those decisions. I don't know, John, if you have any other comments on that. John Shrewsberry : I will say that the -- where we are in the aggregate for fee income is part of what's driving us to get overall fixed expenses as low as they can possibly be, so a little bit different than Erika's question about revenue-related expense on the fee side. But if fee income continues to be under pressure and not growing at an acceptable rate, we're going to go even deeper in core expenses. Erika Najarian : Great. And just one last question. The Propel Card, is that available only to current depositors of Wells Fargo? Or is that going to be more open? John Shrewsberry : No, everybody. Would you like one? It's available for Bank of America's -- we would be happy to deliver one to you. Erika Najarian : I can't even comment on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Question on the expenses. I just want to make sure I have the numbers down straight. The $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion, John, that obviously bakes in $600 million of operating loss. You've had much higher than that. You've had some other one-offs. I think that was the $800 million in the first quarter. I just -- you're on track for the -- to be at that level you set. But what is the right number in terms of what the actual expenses on a like-for-like basis have been in the first half? Just to get a sense of what you have to deliver in the second half to be at the high end or low end of that range? John Shrewsberry : I haven't added up and backed out, but I can tell you that the forecast with 2 quarters in the books is to end up in the range of $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion with the $600 million that you described. We can separately reconcile that, but it does require us to deliver in the second half things that are currently in the -- hard in the forecast to take out. Saul Martinez : Okay. We can get that offline then. And I guess, a broader question, look, you -- there's obviously, a lot of noise in these results and in the first quarter as well. And I get to something like $1.08 on a core basis, adjusting for the number of one-offs you highlighted. And we can nitpick what the right number is. But having said that, the ROTCE kind of on that basis is sort of at the low end, if not a little bit lower than your 14% to 17% guide. Just can you talk to what your level of confidence is that we're, if not at a trough, near a trough in terms of when we start to see earnings power really move up and your confidence that you start to see that in the second half. John Shrewsberry : Sure. Well, we laid out a simulation at Investor Day that describes beyond the second half the expense path for this year, next year and into the following year. There are different revenue assumptions, whether it's the mix of fee and rate or rate sensitivity based on what happens to the curve that you would apply to that and then the Capital Plan that was recently approved in terms of what it means from an ROE perspective. And I think we've got conviction, high confidence that the, call it, 15% ROE, 17% ROTCE in that simulation is exactly where -- we're very confident we'll deliver. It can certainly be better depending on what happens with revenue. We weren't baking in a lot of revenue upside in that just because of the quality of -- the conviction of delivery is easier on the lower revenue number. So what happens in the second half, what happens through 2019 will reflect the expenses that we're talking about. Now there could still be one timers that come through from -- or I have to say operating losses in excess of the $600 million that we want to -- that we'll talk about as we -- as they occur, if they occur. But that's the path that we're on. And while doing that, we're trying to grow revenue in every category that makes sense. And we think that, that, call it, pro forma is very reasonable. Saul Martinez : Okay. Just I guess, a final question. I think somebody asked you about Pick-a-Pay additional sales going forward. The sale of the Puerto Rico assets, what is the -- is that expected approved for 3Q? John Shrewsberry : It's expected to close on August 1. Yes, the buyer had a regulatory approval that they had to achieve, and they've announced that they've reached that, obtained that. Saul Martinez : Okay. And have you determined or disclosed what the financial impact of the sale is? I forget. John Shrewsberry : No. There's, call it, $1.8 billion worth of loans coming off the books. $1.5 billion of auto receivables and $300 million of floor plan. We've already taken a LOCOM adjustment to the purchase price, and there was some -- a positive impact in our allowance when we did that because we were reserving for consumer loans in Puerto Rico after last year's hurricane, but those have already gone through the numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Switching gears, a quick question on the C&I. Is there a way you can break down kind of how you're seeing borrower demand by maybe the different groupings, by large corporate, middle markets, small businesses? Maybe are you seeing any pickup in demand in one of those segments offset by somewhere else? And also touch on how most of the growth this quarter was in foreign -- what was going on with the foreign growth? Timothy Sloan : Yes, so I would describe in the C&I side, the demand is good, but I wouldn't describe it as great. And to your point about kind of the various businesses, I think the corporate demand tends to be more transaction-deal oriented, so there have been a number of acquisitions, mergers and the like that have been more up to drive that business. So it feels a little bit more episodic today than maybe in other cycles. I think kind of the middle-market demand is -- and we saw growth in our middle-market banking business, so that continues to be good. Small business was again good. I wouldn't describe it as great. In terms of some of the other -- the capital finance business, particularly on the equipment side, was actually very good. And I think you're seeing medium-sized and small businesses take advantage of the write-off capabilities in the new Tax Act, which is a positive, I think, long term for the economy. We're continuing to see real, nice opportunities in our asset-backed finance, ABF business, really across industries. So there's no kind of one driver there. And on the reduction side, we did see a decline in the financial institutions business, primarily driven by demand from financials outside the U.S. So overall, I would say C&I is good but not great, and there's a little story in each one of them. But I think it does reflect an economy that's growing 3-ish percent. John Shrewsberry : I mentioned in my comments that our average drawn rate on revolving credit facility has been about 40% not only year-over-year, but basically at every month throughout the year. That's on $500 billion worth of commitments, so a broad swathe of every business, every industry. It's mostly U.S. but a range of regional geographies, et cetera, not much movement in people's utilization of available credit. Timothy Sloan : And that's really driven by the fact that so many of our customers are just so liquid today, which is one of the reasons why credit quality is so good. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. No, that was very helpful. And then just a quick question on the Pick-a-Pay. I mean, I guess, what's the motivation behind selling that portfolio down? I mean, it's a 12% yield now. I mean, I understand there was a fairly large gain on the piece that you just did sell. But as you look forward, how do you think about that relative to what you need for NII and trying to grow NII and selling it down becomes a headwind at that point? Timothy Sloan : Yes. Go ahead, John. John Shrewsberry : Yes, it's a good question. I mean, it's a portfolio that we designated as noncore a long time ago. They're -- it's a portfolio of borrowers who, while they've improved since we originally acquired the portfolio and the merger with Wachovia, are still not of the same credit quality as our average prime jumbo borrower. So they're still a little bit -- it is a lower credit quality mortgage portfolio. In this environment where the market or the bid for yield is so hot, we make comparisons of how many years' worth of net interest income we're essentially capturing at once from somebody who's willing to pay today -- or receive today's yields for those higher coupons. And from time to time, it's made sense to do it. That bid could fade, and we'd be happy riding it out with those portfolios over time. But it's partially economic and opportunistic and, frankly, a continued realization that, that is a noncore portfolio. It's something that we wouldn't originate today. We wouldn't have originated for ourselves. And over time, it's intended to go to zero. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : A few questions here. Just on the wealth management side, wanted to see what your updated commentary is around some of the attrition in the business. Is it still -- in terms of people leaving, is it still that they're \u2013 wouldn't otherwise people that you would be okay with leaving, as you indicated that some of those departures were okay to leave? Or are you starting to see some attrition mount that's creating a little bit of a top line pressure there? Timothy Sloan : Yes. I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a concern on our part. I think what you're seeing is an aging and retirement of the FA population. I think it's somewhere between 1/3 or 40% of the population -- or the attrition is just folks retiring, which we've been planning for, for a while. The -- in addition, we had one episodic impact, and that was that when Wachovia purchased A.G. Edwards, there was a 10-year agreement structure, and that 10-year agreement structure matured in the second quarter. And so we saw a little bit of an increase there. I think overall, what we're -- when you look at the first quarter to the second quarter, I think we're down less than 200 FAs, and the overall quality of the FAs has actually increased a bit. I think that this is a challenge that the industry has because the average age of an experience level of FAs in the market is just a little bit older than your average banker. And so we're going to continue to deal with that. I think the key for us is to make sure that we've got the right transition place -- in place, which Jon Weiss and David Kowach are very focused on, make sure that we've got -- we're continuing to develop the new FAs in the salary and bonus kind of business model structure and then making sure that we're continuing to invest on the digital side, Intuitive Investor is an example, so that the new demographic of investors has got additional options in addition to a real high-quality traditional FA model. John Pancari : Got it. All right. And then on that front or at least on the investment front, either personnel or technology, when it comes to the expense saves that you're looking for, are you still good with $2 billion in 2019 falling to the bottom line? John Shrewsberry : Well, yes, we are. But in terms of the -- our overall expenses for '19, this $52 billion to $53 billion that we're guiding to is a way to think about what that means in connection with run rate expenses, investment expenses, everything else that's going on. But yes. John Pancari : Okay, all right. And then lastly, I know you brought up -- John, you brought up the stress capital buffer factor and kind of sizing up the deployment opportunity here. Do you have any initial take on that impact? I'm assuming you've really looked at it to a degree here. Any initial take on what that means for the quantification of your excess capital? I mean, by our early math on our side, it seems like it could be a fairly sizable hit for a number of the banks. John Shrewsberry : It's too soon to tell because we're still at the NPR stage and a lot could change. We submitted our own comment letter back. It's posted on the Fed's website, so you can get our institutional thoughts on what they might do next with their proposal. I agree that as we looked at the expected impact on everybody, it would appear to be a little bit higher than what folks have targeted for a CET1 level today. Having said that, I think maybe because of our business model, the initial calculated impact to us is probably at the lower end of that range, especially for the larger banks. But I think it's too soon to tell. We could all use a little bit more transparency to understand where the numbers are really coming from. And at the margin, we have a bias against having really volatile year-to-year capital levels if business models aren't really changing and absent an actual realized change in the economic environment. And it doesn't feel like we're there yet, so that's what we're shooting for. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : John, you guys obviously had a nice increase in the net interest margin in the quarter. And I think you mentioned that one of the benefits was the less negative impact of the hedge ineffectiveness. Can you quantify for us how many basis points that was of the increase? John Shrewsberry : Three. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And going forward, should that continue to be incrementally growing? Or is this -- or is it now just baked in and it shouldn't really have an impact going forward? John Shrewsberry : Just like before as it was moving down, it -- at the margin, what seems to matter most there is what's going on with our highest-cost deposits that end up sitting in cash as we have been increasingly liquid. So we've described what's happened to the balance sheet as some higher beta deposits have run off. Those were -- those diminished the net interest margin. They produced net interest income, but they diminished the margin. And when they're reduced somewhat, then the margin goes up, even though net interest income is probably a little bit lower. So I would look to those things as quarter-to-quarter impacts. It's hard to forecast what's going to happen with hedge ineffectiveness because that has more to do with the basis between LIBOR and OIS and a couple of other things, at least what runs through NIM. And then, of course, whether we're deploying cash into loans will have an impact, and what we pay for deposits will have an impact. So like a lot of things, I do think we should all be looking out for the retail deposit repricing experience in the industry, which has been very low to date. And if anything, it's going to have an impact both on net interest income or NIM in the near term. It'll be paying more for those types of deposits, which hasn't happened yet. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. I see. And speaking of deposits, I think you guys identified in your wealth management area some of the customers took their deposits to move them into higher-yielding alternative deposits. Do you have products that you can offer to them so they don't leave the bank, they could stay in the bank, though I know it would cost you more money to keep them? John Shrewsberry : We have a very big money market mutual fund complex in Wells Fargo Asset Management. And that is the first place that when it's appropriate for a customer to be moving some liquidity out of their bank account and into an asset management instrument, we want to be the ones to do that for them, so. Timothy Sloan : But just to emphasize, the platform is an open architecture platform, and we talked about FAs a little bit earlier. I mean, our advisers are providing the appropriate advice for our customers in terms of what makes sense for that customer and client. Sometimes it's to a Wells Fargo mutual fund money market and sometimes it's to treasuries or some -- it's whatever makes the most sense for that customer. But we've got the broad product set if the customer wants to maintain their -- those balances at Wells Fargo. Gerard Cassidy : I see. And Tim, in one of your answers, you had talked about, historically, Wells has seen the commercial real estate competition or headwinds. Can you give us a little more color of what you're seeing today, whether it's lower yields on loans or underwriting standards are actually weakening where loan-to-values are higher? And how does it compare at this point in the cycle to your memory of past cycles? Timothy Sloan : Good question. I think that what we're seeing is, overall, kind of a slowing of construction activity. So when you look at the detail that we provided in the supplement about the Commercial Real Estate business, we've seen a decline in construction opportunities. That's not atypical at this point in a cycle, that's for sure. There's a real constraint in terms of, candidly, availability of labor and underlying commodity prices have increased. So that's affected the pace of new home construction. That's a little bit different than in prior cycles at this time, I would say. I think overall in terms of kind of the many perm type commercial real estate loan, we are seeing a deterioration in underwriting standards. It's been occurring for some time, so I wouldn't say that it's necessarily accelerating. And then -- but I think relative to kind of other cycles, this is -- it's nowhere near what we saw in 2006 and '07 where we're literally telling folks to put their pencils down. And so I wouldn't describe it as anywhere close to that. But again, you need to be prudent when you're lending short on a very long-term asset. John Shrewsberry : And incidentally as it relates to underwriting standards, it's not all bank-to-bank competition. The competition here is as broad as it's ever been with life companies, mortgage REITs, other asset management types of vehicles, sovereign wealth funds. Any pool of capital that's out there looking for return has got its finger in the pot of commercial real estate finance. One item Tim didn't mention, which is -- which will be one of the tests as we go through this cycle, is retailer-related commercial real estate, so malls and shopping centers, given the focus that folks have on the strength or the ability to compete with different types of retailers. That's probably the -- one of the single individual stripes of risk that is mostly in play in commercial real estate these days. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And just lastly, John, you've been very clear on the expense guidance for the next two years. If I recall, I think in your fourth quarter assumptions, the FDIC surcharges will come out not just for you, but for the industry. Can you give us an update where that stands, if that timeline is still good and how much that will be for you folks? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So I think the industry originally estimated that, that surcharge would have run its course by the end of Q2 of this year. Now it looks like it's going to run through Q3 of this year. And I think the annual benefit to Wells Fargo from the FDIC surcharge is... Timothy Sloan : A couple hundred million. John Shrewsberry : Yes, it's more than that. John Campbell : $300 million. John Shrewsberry : $300 million. So we'll be missing a quarter of that benefit in this year because it's pushed out a quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : You mentioned earlier that the consent order has clearly not affected your ability to grow. Loans obviously have not been growing. And the balance sheet continues to shrink well below the limit you need to stay well under for the consent order requirements. So are you at a point where you get comfort here on the balance sheet or -- and you try to just maintain a reasonable size? What's -- if the trends continue as they've been, what happens to the balance sheet size from here? John Shrewsberry : Well, I think we're out there competing for deposits, the type of deposits that makes sense for us, those that provide the most liquidity benefit. And we're competing for loans day in and day out. And that's what's going to drive the size of the balance sheet. We've talked about the competition for loans and the fact that we've got some portfolios running down on purpose, some where we've tapped the brakes like commercial real estate and auto, although we're probably more open for business in auto than we have been over the last several quarters. But nonetheless, we're still -- we're not growing RWA or GAAP assets at any exciting pace. So what happens with customers on the deposit side, what happens with customers on the loan side is going to drive what the right size is for our balance sheet. There are some other, and we've talked about them in connection with the asset cap, there are some businesses where we can essentially put on balance sheet for securities financing or other things that probably run up GAAP balances and leverage a little bit faster than that natural loan growth type of activity. But there's no -- there's -- frankly, there was never a forecast or an approach to try and drive the size of the balance sheet larger. We can -- we're at scale in every business that we operate in. We're really more focused on getting more profitable, growing customer relationships, growing the number of customers and then taking what the -- what our risk appetite and the markets will give us on the loans side. And I think we could operate under $2 trillion for, frankly, a good long time and be very increasingly profitable and serve all the customers that we have. Kenneth Usdin : Yes. And that's -- my follow-up is going to be along those lines, which is as you continue to work on efficiency of the balance sheet, are there still a bunch of those either lower quality or non-quality deposits that you continue to kind of move out? Or is that now kind of -- we've seen this big decline in the foreign offices, obviously, and a couple other areas. So how close are you onto that max efficiency? John Shrewsberry : We're not operating at max efficiency because there's no pressure to do that. So we're still serving many of those customers in that area. And if it ever came down to a decision between one type of a customer deposit, for example, to take or another, there are other levers to pull. But it's just -- it's not a constraint that's weighing on the company at this time. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. David Long : Wells has been investing heavily in compliance and operational risk as well as IT. Is there a way for you to quantify the number of maybe FTE adds you've made there over the last year? Timothy Sloan : On the risk side, I think one of the highlights that we've provided at Investor Day is that we had added about 2,000 folks, team members in the risk function kind of year-over-year. John Shrewsberry : Which is disproportionately in operational risk and compliance. Timothy Sloan : Exactly. And on the IT side, John, I think that the headcount has been pretty flat? John Shrewsberry : Well, I mean, headcount there is both employees as well as people who work on a contract basis. We've talked about it in terms of dollars. I think our aggregated IT expenses is in the $8 billion range these days. Now a portion of that is risk related and lots of it isn't. It's transforming. It's modernization. It's move to cloud. It's our data environment. It's a number of things. But a meaningful portion of it is in reduction of technology and information security risk at the margin. David Long : Okay. Do you have a number for maybe or a concentration of your FTEs that are revenue generating versus sort of your back-office support, when it would include the compliance, risk and IT and then maybe how that would compare to a year ago or three years ago? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So there's a couple -- I don't have the number at my fingertips, but I can tell you that one of the things to take account -- take into account in doing that is the way that we're increasingly using self-serve and technology to enable customer service and sales. So for example, we've described 12% of our new deposit account opens happening digitally and 43% of our credit card new accounts happening digitally. Previously, those sales would have happened through people, and now those sales are happening through technology. So the -- it's a little apples and oranges over the past few years with the passage of time. I'd say sales, service and operations, though, just in -- to your question in particular, sales, service and operations probably account for between 70% and 75% of our headcount. And staff and technology and, call it, whatever other means are between 25% and 30% of headcount. And that hasn't changed very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Couple of questions. The asset cap, can you give us an update on where -- timing on that, Tim, when, how long? What are you thinking currently? Timothy Sloan : Vivek, no change in the update from Investor Day and that we're working very constructively with the Fed. We've gotten some very thoughtful feedback from them. And our expectation is that sometime in the first half of next year, we'll be able to move through that. I think the point to emphasize there is that our goal is not to just meet expectations so we can get the asset cap lifted. Our goal is to make the fundamental investments and changes that we need to make in how we manage operational and compliance risk at the company. That's the goal, and that's where -- really where we're focused, but no update from a timing standpoint. Vivek Juneja : Okay. John, a question for you. As I look at your RWA, it was flat. Your total assets were down on a period-end basis. So any color on where we -- you saw some increase in the risk weighting on the balance sheet? John Shrewsberry : I would think of it more as the GAAP assets that came down had very low risk weights, because it's -- we're running down high runoff factor deposits that -- where the asset side is sitting in cash. So what remains is something akin to the same RWA that was already there. That's the easiest way to think about it. Vivek Juneja : Got it. Okay. One last one, wealth management, heard the answers earlier. Any color on -- I heard you talk about wealth management clients' deposits are moving now to [indiscernible]. But when I look at your wealth management client assets, those were down. So any color on what the difference is? What's going on there? John Shrewsberry : Yes. I don't think every dollar of a money market mutual fund would have stayed inside Wells Fargo. Some of it -- much of it did, as Tim described. There are other puts and takes. There's market movements. There's customers coming and going. The Rock Creek AWM, actually, that would be in asset management, not in wealth management. I see wealth client assets are up 3% year-over-year and down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, yes. There's nothing in particular that, that's attributable to. Timothy Sloan : Yes. Vivek, a portion went into other assets that we're managing. A portion went outside the company. And again, if that's the right thing for the client, that's fine. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marlin Mosby : I wanted to ask you a little bit more strategic question. I kind of tricked -- played in my brain when you were talking about the service charges on deposits and how you became so much more customer-friendly. At this point, you can become and kind of re-place yourself at a very competitive position versus your competition. It won't matter because you're dealing with so many other issues that you're having to go through from the headlines and all that. But eventually, when you come out from under that, the positioning that you have created will make a difference. And so I'm just kind of thinking, as you've gone through these things and become more customer-friendly in so many different areas, do you think you've gotten to where your pricing is favorable to the rest of the market enough that it could eventually have an impact on the rest of the industry once you come out and you don't have those other pressures? Timothy Sloan : Yes. Marty, it's a really good question. I think our focus is -- and again, you asked it from a strategic standpoint, so let me maybe step back and take it at a higher level. If we have information that can help our customers manage their finances better, and our vision is to help our customers succeed financially, then we should provide that information to our customers, period, right. Over the long run, that is a winning, winning business model. In the short run, as we've talked about, it's been a drag on deposit service charges. And from my perspective, making that -- taking that short-term pain from a revenue standpoint to make the long-term investment in terms of providing the right products, services and information to our customers, we'll make that all day long, right. And so in -- as it relates to Overdraft Rewind or the breadth of our real-time and our balance alerts capabilities, there's no question that those are industry leading. And over time, we think that's going to provide us with a competitive advantage. And we're going to continue -- as we talked about some of the innovation that I highlighted in my earlier comments and the breadth of innovation that Avid talked about at Investor Day, we're going to continue and hopefully increase the pace of that innovation. Again, in the short term, sometimes that has a negative impact on revenues. Over the long term, that makes our customer relationships more valuable. It makes them want to do more business with. It makes them more stable. And for example, we're seeing that in terms of the growth of primary checking accounts. And we're seeing that in terms of the value of those primary checking relationships, which continues to occur. It doesn't happen in one quarter, right. And that's one of the challenges when you try to balance that short term versus long term. Marlin Mosby : Let me throw, as my follow-up, a specific example of we've been able to put interest on DDAs. And as the ECRs are all going up and some of these deposits are beginning to flee, would that ever be a concept in the sense of another kind of game changer that would be customer-friendly that might give you a competitive advantage if you started to re-shift the way you look at that -- the way you do that account -- those accounts? Timothy Sloan : Well, specifically on the treasury side, you mean? Marlin Mosby : Yes, yes. Timothy Sloan : Well, I think the driver on the treasury side, even though price is important, it's much more important to provide the breadth of products and services and to invest in technology because you're generally dealing with sophisticated businesses. And for example, that's why we introduced the biometric iPrint, right, so that treasurers and money managers can move things more quickly and have more safety and security. I mean, historically, we've always ranked at the top in the treasury management business in terms of our capabilities. And so I think there, the focus should be much less about price and much more about continuing to invest in technology and services. John Shrewsberry : Yes. That's a part of the business that helps the customer -- the commercial customer run their business. It helps them with their procure to pay. it helps them with shortening up their receivables cycle. It reduces the need for working capital in their business. And that's the value-add, and we wouldn't want to move away from that. Timothy Sloan : Great. Well, I want to thank everybody for your time and for your questions. I know it's been a very busy morning for all of you. I do also want to take the opportunity to thank our 265,000 team members. I think we've got the best team in the business. They're working very hard to not only serve our customers but meet and exceed our six goals. So again, thank you very much, and thank you for your trust in Wells Fargo. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I would also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Tim Sloan. Tim Sloan : Thank you, John. Good morning. And I want to thank you all for joining us today. We earned $6 billion in the third quarter, which was $1.13 per diluted common share. And we grew revenue and reduced non-interest expense on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. These results reflect the transformational changes that we have been making at Wells Fargo and I want to focus my comments on the progress that we have made on the six goals that the operating committee and I established last year. The first goal I will focus on is risk management. We are working hard to transform how we manage risk at Wells Fargo. And our goal is not only to meet, but exceed regulatory expectations so that we have the best risk management in the industry. We are pleased with the expertise our new Chief Risk Officer, Mandy Norton has brought to the process and we continue to make progress. We have had constructive dialogue with our regulators. And we are taking their detailed feedback and making changes across the company, especially in our operational and compliance risk management structure. A key milestone in this process is our newly enhanced risk management framework which fundamentally transforms how we manage risk throughout the organization in a comprehensive, integrated, and consistent manner. In addition, during the third quarter, we successfully completed the requirements of a consent order with the OCC related to compliance with provisions of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. Satisfying this consent order is a great example of why effective risk management is not only good for Wells Fargo, but also good for our customers. As part of our goal to provide exceptional customer service and advice, Wells Fargo advisors launched the Envision scenario, which allows our clients to model how changing their investment decisions can impact their investment goals. In addition, our retail customers continue to benefit from consumer-friendly initiatives we implemented last year, including overdraft rewind which has helped over 1.8 million customers avoid overdraft charges. As some of you may have seen, we recently launched a new ad as part of our national advertising campaign highlighting this industry leading feature. Also in the third quarter this year, we eliminated monthly service fees for teen checking and everyday checking for young adults. While this latest change does not have a material impact on our deposit service charges since the monthly fees were minimal, it does encourage younger customers to join and stay with Wells Fargo. The changes we are making are having a positive impact. For example, retention of our primary consumer checking customers reached a 5-year high in the third quarter. We have also continued to introduce industry leading innovations, including using technology to provide our customers more control and transparency. In September, 28% of all retail mortgage applications were done through our online mortgage tool which we introduced in March. We also recently launched Control Tower, which provides customers with a single view of their digital financial footprint, including where their Wells Fargo debit or credit card or account information is connected such as with recurring payments. It also allows customers to quickly turn on or off their Wells Fargo debit and credit card from their mobile device. I\u2019ll also highlight that the response to our newly enhanced Propel credit card has exceeded our expectations. Leadership and corporate citizenship is one of our six goals because we believe Wells Fargo should play a role in building stronger communities. According to a recent survey on corporate giving by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, the Wells Fargo Foundation was the number two corporate cash giver in the U.S. We\u2019ve always been a large donor, but earlier this year our Foundation announced it would target $400 million in contributions to communities across the U.S., a 40% increase from a year ago and we are on track to reach that milestone. This latest increase was not part of the ranking from the Chronicle of Philanthropy since that ranking was based on 2017 data. Most recently Wells Fargo announced two separate $1 million donations to support Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael Relief Efforts. We are committed to working with organizations and agencies on the ground to help our communities recover and providing continued assistance to our team members and customers, who have been impacted including reversing certain fees and allocating $3 million to our WE Care Fund, which provides grants to team members who faced a catastrophic disaster or financial hardship resulting from an event beyond their control. We also want to be an industry leader in team member engagement and our efforts to make Wells Fargo a better place to work are reflected in continued low voluntary team member attrition. Third quarter voluntary attrition was stable compared with the second quarter, which was at the lowest level in over five years. Next week we\u2019ll launch a new company-wide team member experience survey, which is being conducted by an outside vendor and is another way we will receive feedback from our team members to make progress towards our goal of being the leader in engagement. As part of our goal of delivering long-term shareholder value, we are committed to generating high returns and then returning more capital to shareholders. We returned a record $8.9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the third quarter, more than double the amount returned a year ago. We\u2019re also committed to evolving our business model to meet our customers\u2019 financial needs in a more streamlined and efficient manner. We are on track with our expense savings initiatives, including a recently established 2020 expense target of $50 billion to $51 billion, which includes approximately $600 million of typical operating losses and excludes litigation and remediation accruals and penalties. While there is more work to do, the substantial progress we are making on our goals demonstrates how hard our team is working to transform Wells Fargo. We are addressing past issues, enhancing our focus on our customers, strengthening risk management and controls, simplifying our organization and improving the team member experience. I\u2019m confident that these changes are building a better Wells Fargo for all of our stakeholders and we are encouraged by the positive business trends we had in the third quarter, including year-over-year growth in primary consumer checking customers, debit and credit card usage, loan originations in auto, small business, home equity and personal loans and lines. John Shrewsberry will now discuss our financial results in more detail. John Shrewsberry : Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We highlight our third quarter results on Page 2, which included an ROE of 12.04% and ROTCE of 14.33%. We generated positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and a linked quarter basis. We continued to have strong credit quality and high levels of liquidity and capital and we doubled our capital return compared with the third quarter last year, including a 10% increase in our common stock dividend. As Tim highlighted, we had positive business momentum including primary consumer checking customers up 1.7% from a year ago, increased debit and credit card usage with debit card purchase volume up 9%, and consumer general purpose credit card purchase volume up 7% from a year ago, and higher loan originations with auto up 10%, small business up 28%, home equity up 16%, and personal loans and lines up 3% from a year ago. On Page 3, we highlight noteworthy items in the third quarter. Our earnings were $6 billion included a $638 million gain on the sale of $1.7 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans, $605 million of operating losses primarily related to remediation expense for a variety of matters including an additional $241 million accruals of previously disclosed issues related to automobile collateral and protection insurance, $100 million reserve release reflecting strong credit performance as well as lower loan balances. And an effective income tax rate of 20.1% which included net discrete income tax expense related to the re-measurement of our initial estimates for the impacts of the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act recognized in the fourth quarter. We currently expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of this year to be approximately 19% excluding the impact of any future discrete items. Our results also included the redemption of our Series J preferred stock which diluted \u2013 which reduced diluted EPS by $0.03 per share due to the elimination of the purchase accounting discount recorded on these shares at the time of Wachovia acquisition. We highlighted some important trends in our year-over-year results on Page 4. Revenue growth included the increase in net interest income as higher NIM offset lower earning assets, expenses declined driven by lower operating losses, however we also had lower expenses in a number of other categories including outside professional services, outside data processing and travel and entertainment. Strong credit performance as well as lower loan balances resulted in lower provision expense and our capital levels remained strong while we increased our share buyback and reduced common shares outstanding by 4%. I will be highlighting the balance sheet and income statement drivers on Pages 5, 6 and throughout the call starting with loans on Page 7, so we will jump to Page 7. Average loans declined $4.6 billion from the second quarter. The decline in average loan balances was driven by strategic loan sales, continued reductions in commercial real estate reflecting our conservative underwriting, declines in auto as we have transformed that business and run off of legacy junior lean mortgage loans. Period end loans were down $9.6 billion from a year ago. Over the last 12 months we have sold or moved to held for sale of $6.8 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans and reliable financial services loans. Commercial loans declined $1.2 billion from the second quarter despite C&I loans increasing $1.5 billion with growth in corporate and investment banking, commercial capital and commercial real estate credit facilities through REITs and non-depository financial institutions. This growth was more than offset by commercial real estate loans declining $2.8 billion. The decline in CRE mortgage loans was due to ongoing pay-downs on existing and acquired loans as well as lower originations reflecting continued credit discipline in competitive and highly liquid financing markets. CRE construction loans increased $753 million with growth in community lending, hospitality and senior housing. As we show on Page 9 consumer loans declined $746 million from the second quarter which was driven by the sales of $1.7 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans and $374 million of auto loans transferred to held-for-sale. Let me highlight our largest consumer loan portfolios in more detail starting with the first mortgage loan portfolio which increased $1.3 billion from the second quarter. Nonconforming loans grew $6.4 billion which was partially offset by the Pick-a-Pay PCI loan sales. In addition $249 million of nonconforming mortgage loan originations that would have otherwise been included in this portfolio were designated as held-for-sale in anticipation of future issuance of RMBS securities. Junior lean mortgage loans continued to decline as pay downs more than offset new originations which grew 3% from the second quarter and 16% from a year ago. Credit card loans increased $1.1 billion from the second quarter. New accounts grew 27% from the second quarter benefiting from the launch of the new Propel card which exceeded our expectations and higher originations through digital channels which generated 45% of all new credit card accounts. Auto loans were down $1.6 billion from the second quarter due to expected continued run off and the transfer of the remaining $374 million of reliable financial services auto loans to held-for-sale. Auto originations increased 8% from the second quarter and 10% from a year ago with high quality origination growth driven by changes related to the business which makes it easier for customers to do business with us including increased automated underwriting. We are well positioned for originations to continue to increase and we expect portfolio balances to begin growing by mid-2019. Average deposits declined $40 billion from a year ago, reflecting lower wholesale banking deposits, including the actions taken in the first half of the year to manage to the asset gap as well as lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher rate alternatives. The $4.9 billion decline in average deposits from the second quarter was driven by lower consumer and small business banking deposits, which includes wealth and investment management deposits as consumers continue to move excess liquidity to higher rate alternatives. Our average deposit cost increased 7 basis points from the second quarter and was up 21 basis points from a year ago compared with the 100 basis point change in the Fed Funds rate. The increase in our average deposit costs was driven by increases in wholesale banking and wealth and investment management deposit rates, while rates paid on other consumer and small business banking deposits have not yet meaningfully responded to rate movements. Deposit betas continue to outperform our expectations. On Page 11, we provide details on period-end deposits, which declined $2.3 billion from the second quarter. Wholesale banking deposits increased $9.1 billion in the third quarter with most of the growth coming later in the quarter after we made targeted adjustments to our pricing in a competitive rate environment. We also had growth in corporate treasury deposits including brokerage CDs which we used as an alternative source of balance sheet funding. Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $13.7 billion from the second quarter driven by customers in wealth and investment management and community banking moving excess liquidity to higher rate alternatives which was partially offset by modest growth in small business banking deposits. Net interest income increased $31 million from the second quarter. This growth included approximately $80 million of benefit from 1 additional day in the quarter and a $54 million benefit from hedge and effectiveness accounting. These benefits were partially offset by a $105 million decline from all other balance sheet mix, re-pricing and variable income. Our NIM increased 1 basis point from the second quarter to 2.94%, driven by a reduction in the proportion of lower yielding assets and a modest benefit from hedge ineffectiveness accounting. Net interest income was relatively stable for the first 9 months of this year compared with the year ago and we currently expect net interest income to be up modestly for the full year, reflecting better than expected deposit betas. Non-interest income increased $357 million from the second quarter with growth in other income, market sensitive revenue, mortgage banking, service charges on deposits and card fees. Let me highlight a few of the business drivers in more detail. Deposit service charges were up $41 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by seasonality and partially offset by a higher earnings credit rate for our commercial customers. Trust and investment fees declined $44 million from the second quarter on lower investment banking results and lower retail brokerage transaction activity. Mortgage banking revenue increased $76 million from the second quarter from higher net gains on residential and commercial mortgage loan originations. While residential mortgage loan originations declined $4 billion from the second quarter, their production margin increased to 97 basis points primarily due to an improvement in secondary market conditions. Fourth quarter mortgage originations are expected to be down, reflecting seasonality in the purchase market. Pricing margins remain historically tight due to excess capacity in the industry. And although we have seen stabilization in pricing margins in recent quarters, we have not seen any meaningful improvement. We expect the production margin in the fourth quarter to be within this year\u2019s quarterly range of 77 to 97 basis points. Turning to expenses on Page 14, expenses declined from both the second quarter and a year ago. We are on track to achieve our expense targets of $53.5 billion to $54.5 billion this year, $52 billion to $53 billion in 2019, and $50 billion to $51 billion in 2020. Each of these annual expense targets include approximately $600 million of typical operating losses and exclude litigation and remediation accruals and penalties. Given our commitment to improving efficiency, the transformational changes we are making across our businesses as well as our changing customer preferences, including adoption of digital self-service capabilities, we recently announced that we expect our headcount to decline by approximately 5% to 10% within the next 3 years as part of achieving our expense targets. This projected decline is expected to be achieved through displacement as well as normal team member attrition. An important priority for us as we move forward will be supporting those team members who are impacted. Let me explain the trends in our third quarter expenses in more detail starting on Page 15. Expenses were down $219 million or 2% from the second quarter. We had declines in most of our expense categories on a linked quarter basis, including compensation and benefits, revenue related, running the business both discretionary and non-discretionary and third-party services. The increase in infrastructure expense was driven by higher equipment expense primarily due to PC purchases related to the company\u2019s migration to Windows 10. As we show on Page 16, expenses were down $588 million or 4% from a year ago driven by lower operating losses. We also had lower revenue related expense and third-party services expense. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily due to higher salary expense, higher severance as well as higher 401(k) matching expense and higher expenses from the broad-based restricted stock award granted to eligible team members in the first quarter. These higher expenses were partially offset by the impact of the sale of Wells Fargo insurance services and lower FTEs as part of our efficiency initiative. Total FTEs were down 2% from a year ago. The increase in running the business discretionary expenses was driven by higher advertising expense due to the reestablished campaign partially offset by lower T&E expense. While we have more work to do, our efforts to improve efficiency are already being reflected in areas such as outside professional services, outside data processing, T&E, postage and supplies and we currently expect that we will meet our 2018 expense target. Turning to our segments starting on Page 17, community banking earnings increased $320 million from the second quarter driven by lower net discrete income tax expense. On Page 18, we provide the community banking metrics. Teller and ATM transactions declined 6% from a year ago, reflecting continued customer migration to virtual channels. Digital secure sessions increased 20% from a year ago. In the third quarter, we consolidated 93 branches and we are on track to consolidate approximately 300 branches this year. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we expect to complete the previously announced divestiture of 52 branches. Primary consumer checking customers have grown year-over-year for four consecutive quarters and grew 1.7% year-over-year in the third quarter of this year compared to 0.2% growth a year ago. In the third quarter, we continue to have improvements in primary customer retention, which was at the highest level since we started tracking the metric in 2013. Growth in new checking customers was driven by digital with 12% of new checking customers acquired from the digital channel. Growth in new checking customers also reflected the benefit of ongoing marketing initiatives and strength in acquiring college-age customers. On Page 19, we highlight strong growth in credit and debit card purchase volume. We also had steady improvement in both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with most recent visit survey scores throughout the third quarter and we ended the quarter with both scores rebounding from the second quarter. Turning to Page 20, wholesale banking earnings increased $216 million from the second quarter reflecting lower operating losses and higher revenue. Wealth and investment management earnings increased $287 million from the second quarter, reflecting lower OTTI, which was related in the second quarter due to the impairment related to the announced sale of our ownership stake in Rock Creek. Results from the third quarter also reflected lower operating losses. Turning to Page 22, our strong credit results continued with 29 basis points of net charge-offs in the third quarter. For the fourth consecutive quarter, all of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position. Non-performing assets declined $410 million from the second quarter, the 10th consecutive quarter of decline. Turning to Page 23, the linked quarter decrease in our estimated common equity Tier 1 ratio fully phased-in reflected our increased capital return in the third quarter partially offset by a decline in our risk-weighted assets. The reduction in RWA included a one-time impact from our implementation of the newly issued regulatory guidance covering high volatility commercial real estate, which benefited our CET1 ratio by approximately 10 basis points. So, in summary, we continue to work hard in the transformational changes we are making throughout our businesses, including our expense initiatives and we are on track to meet our expense targets. Our positive business trends in the third quarter included growth in primary consumer checking customers, increased debit and credit card usage and higher loan originations in auto, small business, home equity and personal loans and lines which are all up from a year ago and we generated positive operating leverage on both a year-over-year and linked quarter basis. And with that, Tim and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Good morning, Scott. Scott Siefers : Good morning. I just had a quick question. So, I appreciate the reiteration on the expense guide for the next couple of years. I think one question I wanted to ask about back at the conference in mid-September when you made the 2020 expense guide when it went from simulation to guide, I think a lot of people started to presume that they must hold through for the other aspects of the simulation as well specifically like flat revenues from 2017 up through 2020. So, I mean, is that the case and if not, I guess as you look out over the course of the next 1 to 2 years, what do you see as the main drivers or opportunities of reaccelerating revenue growth as you look forward? John Shrewsberry : Sure. So, in the simulation that we have served up in May at our Investor Day, what we are trying to demonstrate is that, let\u2019s just say even with flat revenue and with expenses as we guided them with credit as we have described it and with our capital plan in place that in 2020, we would be delivering a 15% ROE and a 17% ROTCE. We don\u2019t have a single solid number for 2020 in revenue for all the reasons that you can imagine in terms of where rates go, where industry loan growth, deposit growth and a variety of other things happen. So, we have a range of outcomes for 2020. My current best guess, the big portion of that range that we think about for 2020 has us delivering a 15% ROE and a 17% ROTCE. So, in that respect, I would say that we don\u2019t feel any differently today than we did when we first made that commitment or reupped it. We have been more specific about expenses, because we deemed them to be entirely within our control as we have described them. And so that\u2019s how I think about it. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. And then just on the revenue side specifically even if you don\u2019t want to get into specific numbers or anything just the couple main opportunity points you would see over the next 1 or 2 years? John Shrewsberry : Sure. There is a variety, but I would say a lot of them have to do with driving interest income through ongoing improved net loan growth again depending on what market conditions we are operating within. And then there are a handful of drivers on the non-interest income side as we work to increase share in many of the businesses that we are in. Some of them as we have talked about are on different cycles than others like mortgage, for example, where if that market is shrinking and if the industry gain on sale is as it is today, then the outcomes in the future will reflect the size of the market, our position in the market and what profitability looks like overall. We have got some businesses that are meaningfully levered to the S&P for example like the drivers of our trusted investment fees. All of those things are going to reflect what\u2019s going on in the world as much as they do how well we are competing and how hard we are working to win business. All of that goes into it. Tim Sloan : And Scott, I would just reinforce John\u2019s comments by looking at some of the specific examples that you can see in the results this quarter in, for example, our auto business. I mean, we have been making significant changes in the business and we have been talking about the fact that once we have made those changes and Mary Mack and Laura Schubach are doing a great job that we thought we would see and expected to see some loan growth. And now, you have seen that for two consecutive quarters and we reiterated that we think by the middle of next year, we will see growth in the overall portfolio. I think the exciting thing about the auto business is not only are we seeing quarter, year-over-year and sequential quarter growth in loans, but we are doing it more efficiently, because about 40% of all the loans that we are originating are being originated on an automated basis in terms of credit decisioning as opposed to a manual basis. And I could go on and on and give you some additional examples this quarter. But I would just encourage you as I know you will to go through the detail and see the many examples of our businesses that show year-over-year and sequential growth. John Shrewsberry : I would modify that to say growth and originations. Tim Sloan : Originations, yes, exactly. Thanks, John. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. And then one final just ticky-tack question, I know you have been obviously huge repurchase numbers for the full quarter. I know more recently, you have probably been out due to blackout periods around earnings. When are you able to get back into repurchase shares? John Shrewsberry : Monday. Scott Siefers : Monday, okay. Alright, perfect. Thank you guys very much for taking the questions. Tim Sloan : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hi, Erika. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on Scott\u2019s line of questioning. As we think about the $50 billion to $51 billion for 2020 outside of the headcount trajectory that you have announced, is the 2020 target a result of something incremental that you had unearthed in terms of an expense opportunity or is it really just a continuation of the process improvement that you started a few years ago? And I am going to ask this question another way, if revenues happen to be better than expected and the market is wrong about banks or at the top end of the range, is that $50 billion to $51 billion a firm dollar number to expect? John Shrewsberry : Sure. So, I would say that without a doubt, we have continued to uncover incremental opportunities and that\u2019s a way of business now where we have a fully staffed program that goes from function to function and business to business looking for ways to drive continuous improvement. And so the gross opportunity for us to take out different kinds of expense, third-party expense, we have talked about some of the team member activities, real estate, other things that contribute will be ongoing. There is also areas where we are constantly investing and there are new dollars being spent. And the net of it is what gets us to $50 billion to $51 billion. I would say if there is an extraordinary revenue environment, depends where that revenue is coming from because not all dollars of revenue have the same expense load attached to them. But if we were to miss on the high side, because there was a big revenue opportunity and you guys probably remember what happened when we did this at the beginning of this cycle when we had a hard dollar expense target and then the biggest mortgage refinancing opportunity ever presented itself. We missed our expense target on the high side, because we were producing billions of dollars of incremental revenue and it was the right thing to do. We will be very transparent in talking about if that\u2019s the situation that we find ourselves in either on the high side or frankly on the low side. If the revenue environment is stopping and we think that we need to do something different about structuring our business and capacity, etcetera and that needs to take us lower, then we would be open-minded certainly about that. We are trying to drive this return on equity outcome regardless of what the market delivers to us. If it\u2019s just a big upside, then we will try and take full advantage of it. If it\u2019s a rougher depending on where the economy is, the business cycle, etcetera, if it\u2019s a rougher revenue environment, then we will take the necessary measures as well. Erika Najarian : We can all hope, right. I had another question commercial loan growth across the industry hasn\u2019t quite matched what we had hoped as we thought about GDP and CapEx expectations. And I am wondering if you could give us a little bit better sense on the non-bank competition. And specifically, I am interested in the different structures that are available to your clients, the competition from private middle-market direct lending? And the other thing and I am sorry to jumble this all in one question, I noticed that Wells\u2019 C&I portfolio, 20% of your exposure is to asset managers. And I am wondering is that all sort of more short duration in nature like CLO warehousing or do you have any term exposure in that asset manager bucket? Tim Sloan : Yes. So Erika, no problem with three questions, we won\u2019t charge you extra. That\u2019s fine. To think maybe in reverse order, you are absolutely right. I mean, we have a really strong asset-backed finance business and we have seen good growth in that business for some of the reasons that you allude to which is that we have seen non-bank competition in a variety of forms continue to increase. We have seen non-bank competition throughout the history of the company. It\u2019s in a little bit different form right now, because of some of the legacy non-bank competitors have gone away, gone out of business whatever, but the fundamental underwriting in that group is relatively short duration. It tends to be structured on an asset-by-asset basis, which gives us approval rights and the like and the advance rates are very attractive. So, we like that business. Sometimes we are financing one of our competitors on a deal and sometimes we are sharing the credit, but that\u2019s okay, I mean, that\u2019s just part of the overall business to make sure that we are providing credit to all of our customers. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Sometimes it\u2019s to a securitization takeout, sometimes it\u2019s got some term to it. I think we have talked about this at the last conference that I spoke at, there is a distribution of consumer and commercial asset types, interesting most of which where we are deeply in the underlying business although sometimes these non-banks as where you started your question are competing in a way that we wouldn\u2019t directly. And so we like the cross-collateralization and the haircut that we get in order to be willing to take the exposure. But more broadly, with respect to the competitive set being widened, I can tell you in commercial real estate, for example, which is really the early warning indicator that we have talked about for a while in terms of where markets have gotten hotter, bank lending and commercial real estate was at about a third of the market in 2016 and it\u2019s about 15% in 2018 and it\u2019s CMBS, it\u2019s CRE, CLOs, it\u2019s direct lending real estate funds, it\u2019s life companies and it\u2019s others that are competing in different ways. And usually, it\u2019s a question of more leverage and from our perspective, a risk-adjusted return that doesn\u2019t make sense for what belongs on a bank\u2019s portfolio as a whole loan. We might go back around the other way and finance them at a haircut on a cross-collateralized pool, but they are taking more risk on a whole loan than a national bank would or should. And I think other banks have reflected that same concern. On the C&I side of things, it\u2019s really \u2013 there is a lot of direct lending going on in higher leverage categories or in call it non-traditionally bank eligible categories. But most of the action still seems to be around middle-market CLOs or middle-market LBOs being financed by CLOs on the one hand and we were never in that business in a meaningful way. So, it doesn\u2019t really hurt in terms of a loss. It\u2019s also a business that we can pursue on a pooled basis with a haircut after the fact, but you have got all manner of sovereign wealth funds and alternative asset managers and others who are aggressive in an unregulated way and doing things on a whole loan basis that a bank won\u2019t do. Tim Sloan : And Erika, I think overall what we are seeing is that because of the economic growth here in the U.S., in particular, but around the world, the credit quality for our customers in the commercial, corporate world has never been better. Their balance sheets are strong. They have extended their maturities. Their interest coverage is higher than it\u2019s ever been, because their debt service is lower. So, I think the fact that we have got very buoyant capital markets, very liquid capital markets and we have high credit quality for our customers means that loan growth is a little bit slower than we would have all imagined in an economic growth level that we are seeing right now. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Tim Sloan : Thanks, Erika. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hey, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning, guys. Just one clarification. John, in your intro remarks, you had mentioned that you still expect NII to be, I think you said slightly higher or let\u2019s say flat and I just wanted to make sure just clarify that and talk about it, are you talking about on an FTE basis or a non-FTE basis? John Shrewsberry : On a taxable equivalent basis, if that\u2019s the question. Ken Usdin : That\u2019s the question is what are you talking about it on a fully taxable equivalent basis or a non-fully FTE basis? John Shrewsberry : On a GAAP basis, we expect it to be flat to a little bit stronger. That\u2019s how I think, I mean and by a little bit, it\u2019s close enough that plus or minus flat. Ken Usdin : Okay, GAAP basis. Understood, thank you. So, second question just on the mix of the balance sheet, we see that obviously with rising rates, your OCI is going up a little bit and this is a balance that I think you have talked about for a while now, John. So, what are you doing in terms of the tons of cash on the balance sheet still, lot of room here to remix, but obviously, you are keeping the portfolio in check. Just talk to us about how your investment strategy is evolving given where the rates have now been moving and that balancing act? John Shrewsberry : Sure. So, we have a certain amount of maturity amortization and prepayment from our bond portfolio that has to be reinvested every quarter and we are more enthusiastic about those reinvestment possibilities in the low 3% versus the high 2%. It\u2019s not that different. If you roll back the tape a couple of years, the trade-off used to be zero yield on cash and 2% on 10 years. And so the question was how much more duration risk, how much more OCI exposure do we want to have by taking on that much more duration when we were otherwise earning nothing on the cash. Today, we are earning 2% plus on the cash and the opportunity is an extra, call it, 100 or 125 basis points in 10 years or more than that in mortgages if we load up the mortgage securities. There are some liquidity constraints in agency mortgages. We have been very full portfolio in that category and our LCR calculation is hovers around probably as much as it could be. Given our current \u2013 the rest of our current liquidity profile, so it\u2019s really more a question of straight 10 years or whatever the maturity profile is, but treasuries or Ginnie Mae securities. And I think we have been, while this backup is happening and not knowing exactly where it\u2019s going to end, I think we have been a little bit circumspect about incrementally moving from 2 and change percent on cash further out the curve. There is an opportunity, if rates continue to back, it\u2019s a March back up, then it\u2019s going to be that much more attractive, it\u2019s the curve that is steepening with it. And we have like most people do at least a few more Fed moves built into our expectations over the next year or so. So the return on cash actually is relatively attractive over time if the curve is going to flatten as a result of that rather than long and continuing to move up. So that\u2019s what we are thinking about. We are thinking about it in the context of our existing capital plan as well, so all of that OCI exposure is more meaningful when you are actually moving down, although if you didn\u2019t see much of the move down in CET1 this quarter because of the RWA calculation. But the further \u2013 the closer we get towards 10%, the more precise we have to be about our exposure to OCI. And the last thing I would say about it is in a post tax reform world that\u2019s a bigger deal because those losses, those OCI losses have less shield from them from a higher tax rate. So they have more of an impact on capital than they used to. Ken Usdin : Okay, I got it. Thanks a lot for that John. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John Shrewsberry : Hi John. Tim Sloan : Good morning John. John McDonald : Hi, good morning guys. John, I was wondering what\u2019s your confidence in the outlook for the auto loans to inflect positively to growth by mid-2019. And then separately do you have that timeline for stabilization to the home equity\u2026? John Shrewsberry : Two good questions, I would say in auto one of those businesses as you know everyday you are faced with the new series of option loan by loan and you have choices to make on every loan about the risk reward. I think we like what we are seeing now, we are up 10% year-over-year. And both Laura and Mary are giving indications that we should continue along those lines so that the combination of that level of growth and the level of amortization that\u2019s in the book has those lines crossing at some point in 2019. So we currently estimate mid-2019 could it be a little bit sooner, could it be a little bit later, it\u2019s yes. It\u2019s been \u2013 we are estimating it happens in the middle of the year. But the trends like our enthusiasm for the business, the risk rewards that we are seeing today, the way we are competing, the fact that we are through that reached complete restructuring of that business is a much more durable well risk managed way all feels very good. And then with respect to home equity, that\u2019s interesting. So you can mark on a spreadsheet pretty clearly what the tick down of the legacy home equity portfolio looks like, but the origination and utilization of new home equity loans is we are in uncharted territory, right. So we are just getting to a point now everybody who has refinanced their first in the last few years is suddenly in the money for as they are not willing to give up that first if they want more leverage, they won\u2019t do another refi or cash out refi, they are going to think of their \u2013 using their home to the source of borrowing. They are going to think about a second to not disturb the first. So how quickly people take advantage of that, to what extent people are interested responsibly in that incremental amount of leverage is a whole new world. I think we are really encouraged by the referral activity what we have described in the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year up activity really is an expression I think of people in our branches. Our own people in our branch is getting more comfortable with the referral process or given events over the last couple of years. So that in combination with this new phenomenon of a second is the way to go because you can\u2019t refi your first without upping your payment on the whole mortgage amount is what we are going to see unfold over the next couple of quarters. Tim Sloan : John the only other point I would make in just \u2013 and I know you know this, but I think any time we talk about loan growth is important to re-emphasize it. And that is, our goal is not to grow loans, our goal is to service customers and originate good credit. So based on what we are seeing today, we see more than ample opportunity to grow the auto originations. And so as John and I have said the best estimate is mid next year, but we are going to do it in a very responsible way. John Shrewsberry : I think I would also say on home equity, I would be surprised if \u2013 more than surprised if we ever end up with the same percentage of our balance sheet in second lien mortgage paper versus where we were both Wells Fargo alone pre-crisis and then the combination of Wells and Wachovia right after the merger. Tim Sloan : Yes, I think that\u2019s a good point, John. John McDonald : Okay. And then just in terms of reputational issues and negative headlines just wanted to ask you each a question, John, if you could elaborate on your comments from September that these issues perhaps are hurting some of your loan growth trends. And then Tim, if you could talk on the wealth management side where you have kind of underperformed peers on asset flows and net advisory tension. How are headlines and reputational issues affecting your performance in wealth management on the advisor and customer front? John Shrewsberry : Sure. In terms of wholesale, we have talked about some specifics of this, but it\u2019s really more of a \u2013 it\u2019s mostly the business that we call GIB, government and institutional banking in wholesale where it\u2019s just a little bit more politically charged environment in terms of how we compete and having reputational issues has made it harder for that team. There is probably a little bit of that in some other wholesale categories. You can\u2019t point to it, it\u2019s not measurable, but it\u2019s a headwind I\u2019d say for some of our people. But where it really demonstrates or reveals itself is in government and in institutional banking. Tim Sloan : And John, on the wealth and investment management side, in particular, FAs, we saw in the third quarter hiring being relatively flat to the second quarter. And as you recall, we were down in the second quarter and the primary factor was the termination of the AG Edwards agreements which had a 10-year term and they ended it in second quarter 2018. In addition, attrition in the third quarter was down from the second quarter. In fact, we were net up in September, which was great. And then finally, when we think about FA headcount, what we are really focused on is FA productivity. And what we have seen is that for our existing FA population and team that we are seeing improvements in loan origination as well as improvements in the overall size of their books. So, there has been some impact from some of the reputation issues that we had, but I think the important thing is that you see in the overall numbers and performance this quarter, the improvement and us getting beyond some of those reputational issues. We still have some headwinds we are going to deal with, but we are making progress. John McDonald : Okay. And then last quick thing, sorry if I missed this at the beginning, Tim, but do you have any progress to report or update in terms of the federal reserve requirements and your tone of dialogue with them and any projected timeline for getting removed from the asset cap? Tim Sloan : Well, John, I made a thrilling update. So, you know what that the dialogue continues to be very good. And I described it earlier as being very constructive. They are providing feedback to the risk management framework that I mentioned earlier in the broadcast here, but we are still planning on operating under the asset cap through the first part of next year. John McDonald : Okay, thanks. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Couple of questions. Obviously, we can track the branch rationalization, the branch cuts on a weekly basis and it looks like there was a nice uptick in trimming the branch numbers over the past quarter. And I just wondered how much of that benefit to the expense line is in the run-rate in 3Q, how much potential improvement comes in 4Q and do you feel that you are at the run-rate for branch rationalization at this stage? John Shrewsberry : Yes. I think the amount of noticeable benefit quarter by quarter would be pretty tough to see from the 93 branches. What tends to happen when we are consolidating a branch is we will dispose of the real estate one way or the other. If there is a lease they still had some tail to it that expense won\u2019t come out until it\u2019s been dealt with one way or the other. And then on the people front, we are really trying to absorb those people into the branches in which that\u2019s been consolidated and then they will allow attrition which is natural in a retail business to right-size the right amount of people for the remaining branches over some period of time. So, we have talked in the past about the aggregate number, but it takes a while to be revealed. I would expect for this year\u2019s actions, you will start to really feel it next year. You wouldn\u2019t notice it this year. And then of course for the branches that we are selling, the 50 odd that we are selling that will close this quarter that will be a little bit more immediate because team members are transferring over to the acquirer premises and all related expenses are transferring over. Again, that\u2019s only 52, but that will be much more of a light switch. Betsy Graseck : Sure. Got it. Can you just on the ones that you are closing obviously not the ones you are selling, but the ones you are closing, can you talk a little bit about the efforts underway to retain the customers of those? And can you give us a sense as to what you have seen in deposit attrition and how you are dealing with that? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So, on the ones that we have consolidated really the game plan is to retain everything and that\u2019s because we have got such close physical proximity of the ones that we are consolidating, which is why we are choosing to consolidate them rather than to sell them or dispose of them in some other way or leave them open if they are serving a discrete or distinct market area. So, I think the realized outcomes to-date are that we have retained almost 100% of the deposits from the consolidated branch. I think I have seen 1% or 2% deposit attrition which you can\u2019t even really attribute to the consolidation. It\u2019s also in this rising rate environment. We have been fed deposits migrate for other reasons, but the intention is to keep all of the customers and all of the deposits and we have had a great run at that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks so much. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Matt. Tim Sloan : Hey, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. So, revenue ticked up a little bit both last quarter and year-over-year as you pointed out and obviously, there was a gain this quarter, but there also was last quarter. Is this the inflection of revenues as you think about maybe year-over-year given some seasonality on a QQ basis or are there still enough drags in maybe parts of the loan portfolio and some of the fee categories that make it hard to call? Tim Sloan : Matt, I hope you are right. I mean, we feel confident about our ability to grow revenue over time. Each quarter is going to have a story to it, but I think the important thing is that when you look \u2013 if you look across the income statement, you are seeing more of our business, more of our products gross on a sequential quarter basis and year-over-year. So, I think that\u2019s a good sign. As John said, we are a large mortgage provider in this country. We love the business. It\u2019s in overcapacity right now. It\u2019s unclear exactly how long it\u2019s going to take debt to shake out, but it will and that will be good for us. And we clearly have the ability to compete in that business given the broad scope of our mortgage business, but overall, we are optimistic about growing revenues, whether September 30 was the exact inflection point, I can\u2019t promise you that. Matt O\u2019Connor: And I guess specific on some of the drivers of net interest income, as you look out on loans, it seems like they are starting to bottom out on a period end basis. Obviously, you just talked about the confidence in the auto growing around midyear next year. So, maybe that drag is a little bit less, do you start to see loans level out in the fourth quarter? Tim Sloan : I hope. It\u2019s going to be as much of a function of customer demand than anything. I think when you take apart the components on the consumer side, the fourth quarter tends to be in terms of mortgage origination it tends to be a little bit slower than the third quarter, but credit card tends to be a little bit stronger from a seasonal standpoint. So, that\u2019s good. As John described, I think we are in a new world as it relates to home equity loans, but the fact that we saw growth across the consumer portfolio was actually good. On the commercial side, we are cautiously optimistic about growth in the fourth quarter, again, ex maybe some of the commercial real estate portfolio for the reasons that John described, because we saw a reasonable uptick toward the end of the third quarter. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just lastly on the NIM, anything to flag there, I know there is your sell down from the PCI reduces the accretable yield over time, but I think it actually accelerates a little bit near-term. But on the flipside, you have the backup the long rates I think could be a little bit of a drag in 4Q if it holds here. So, just any near-term commentary and that would be helpful? Tim Sloan : I think the biggest driver is in the very near-term will be what happens with deposit pricing. We have talked about this, but we think we are still we are outperforming what we would have \u2013 what we have had modeled, based on historical experience as this increase in policy rates has occurred and if we continue to outperform and that will be helpful for the NIM. But if there is a big catch-up, there is something different happens then that will be a headwind. But to me that\u2019s probably the biggest \u2013 hard to forecast. We certainly \u2013 we all model at a certain way, but we are realizing it a little bit better than that, that will make a difference. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. So the hedge in effectiveness from the long and moving up is not all that material with the move that we have? John Shrewsberry : I don\u2019t think so, I mean it\u2019s impact at the end of the quarter we will be calling out at that time, I tend to discount that because it\u2019s uneconomic, it\u2019s really just a \u2013 it\u2019s an accounting outcome that\u2019s back to zero over the life of the hedge instruments and the hedge itself from the \u2013 real fundamental of the business, the cash flow that we are generating I think deposit pricing is probably the biggest variable in the quarter. And over the next few quarters it\u2019s going to determine how strong net interest margin expansion could be. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thanks for taking all my questions. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Good morning John. John Pancari : Good morning, Tim just around the sales practice issues, one of the key investor concerns are just around the likelihood of new issues, I mean lately we have been seeing a lot of headlines, but it\u2019s in development of existing issues, so I mean could you talk about how you view the likelihood of brand new issues and I guess where are you in the process scrubbing the business for similar issues that can create some type of new development? Thanks. Tim Sloan : So I am hopeful that we won\u2019t have any new issues. And you are right I think the pace of new issues in the recent reporting has been much more focused on updated development. And part of that is just because we want to be very transparent about where we are so that you are all informed and some of that development we create ourselves that we think in the long run that makes a lot of sense. John, we have and we will continue to look across every office, every business, every geography in this company. I met \u2013 I have said in my opening remarks and that is we want to not only meet, but exceed regulatory expectations because that\u2019s the right thing to do for our customers, so we are very far along in the process. We will continue to be very transparent. But we are ultimately going to do the right thing for our customers and make sure that you are informed about it. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks. It\u2019s helpful. And then on the capital side, I know you gave us your 10% CET1 target and you are just shy of 12% now, so clearly a lot that you continue to deploy, can you just talk to us about any changes or how you are feeling about that 10% target, any updates to the timing of when you think you can get there and then maybe just color around how the payout over time can trend I know you are \u2013 post your most recent CCAR result we are looking at about 150% combined pay-out, how do you think that that can trend from here? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Sure. So there is a lot there. First of all with respect to 10%, I think Neil at Investor Day has indicated that the folks \u2013 the implementation of CECL and the implementation of the stress capital buffer and how both of them work in CCAR are things that we need to know to confirm or modify our 10% target. If I had to guess I would say that our target once both of those things have been worked through would be a little bit higher than 10%. Although it\u2019s 10% today because those things are not in full, we don\u2019t really know how they are going to work. I don\u2019t anticipate it to be much higher than 10%, but it\u2019s probably a little bit higher. We had talked before this enacting this capital plan about a 2-year to 3-year run rate to get from where we were and where we are going. Embedded in that is the known trajectory of pay-out along with estimations for our capital generation and for RWA growth, because those all matter in the calculations. So we have been more RWA efficient I think than we had originally estimated and this is why we are at 11.8% or 11.9% today even after paying out almost $9 billion in the quarter as you say again $6 billion worth of net income. So you know how much we are intending to pay out as a result of the last CCAR. And I would expect that the deployment will continue to look like it has recently. With respect to the dividend portion of that, we should all expect that that remains relatively contained versus pre-crisis levels of payout ratio for all the reasons that we have talked about, it\u2019s regulatory guidance. It\u2019s prudent in containing it, so that it can be sustained throughout the cycle. And then the balance of it would happen through share repurchase like it has. We mentioned earlier this year that we intend to do more of it in the first half of the 12 months of this first year of the most recent CCAR and less of it in the second 6 months of that 12-month period and we showed you that in the third quarter and then expect the fourth quarter, it will look similar. John Pancari : Got it. Alright. Thanks, John. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hey, Saul. John Shrewsberry : Hey, Saul. How are you? Saul Martinez : Hey, good morning, guys. I am good. Hey, so on NII, maybe I am taking the guidance a little bit too literally of flat to slightly up. But if you keep a flat NII basically would imply a $12.2 billion number by my calculations for fourth quarter, which is actually a step down versus the last couple of quarters. So, I mean, is that the messaging that you are trying to get across or is it a little bit more broad that within a reasonable range of assumptions you are kind of within a band of outcomes of being flat to slightly higher? John Shrewsberry : The latter. Not to be too succinct. Saul Martinez : Okay. No, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s kind of what I was expecting to hear. And I guess on non-interest revenues obviously a big part of the investment case is sort of a level setting of expectations on revenues. And maybe this question is a little bit too much into the weeds as well, but it seems like a lot of the core revenue items seemed to have stabilized and maybe are starting to grow again. But there is a whole host of items that are significantly volatile, including the other income line. And if you look at that line normalizing for non-core items, it\u2019s been kind of flat to down in recent quarters, can you just give us a sense of again what\u2019s sort of in that number and how we should think about it on an ongoing basis and what a more normalized level or how we should think about modeling it would be? John Shrewsberry : Other, in particular? Saul Martinez : Yes, other, in particular, yes. John Shrewsberry : Yes. So, we call out the major infrequent things that occur as they happen like the sales pick-a-pay, for example. And in many of the past quarters, we have sold other portfolios of pick-a-pay. We have had private equity or venture capital gains go through there. We have had a variety of things that. As you point out, they are volatile. There tends to be something meaningful in that line item in most quarters, not in every quarter. It\u2019s harder to predict, etcetera. So, we are happy to have them when they occur. They are capital generating. They are good for the overall platform. But I would be hesitant to put a run-rate on it and say, take it to the bank. That\u2019s something that you can rely on. Of the component pieces, the smaller component pieces, like charges on fees and loans, cash network fees, commercial real estate brokerage, letters of credit, wire transfer these are things that go into all other fees. That actually has been relatively stable over time. And I would look for those things to reflect the continued ongoing growth of the business. They add up on a quarterly basis to call it $800 million or $900 million. So, if it\u2019s that other fees that you are looking at, then I think you should feel reasonably good about that. Commercial real estate brokerage can be actually quite volatile, because it reflects where we are on the cycle. It reflects the time of year. There is a lot that goes into that. But the other items are much more run-rate and predictable. But back to the episodic gains I would say there. The deeper we get into the markets that we are in, so the tighter credit spreads get, we have already seen rates move backup, it gets harder to generate those types of gains I would say, whether it\u2019s pre-crisis things that have been on the balance sheet for 10 years that were marked a certain way or appreciated investments that we have made over the last 10 years. The further we get into this cycle my sense is the harder it is to continue to regenerate those because asset pricing levels are so rich to begin with. Saul Martinez : Got it. And if I could just \u2013 one more in there, CECL, how \u2013 can you just comment a little bit on your preparations there and when you think you might be able to give more color on what the estimate of financial impact would be? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So I think we are feeling like we are quite prepared with our own capabilities. We are still working with our accountants [ph], still working with our regulators to help them understand how it\u2019s going to work. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate us to be early adopters, so we will be continuing to recalculate and prepare until adoption occurs. I think we have said which you will hear more about our expected numbers next year. But specifically as it applies to us and our observations about how it applies to others and we have talked about this. But on the consumer side of things it tends to increase the calculated allowance. On the commercial side of things it tends to decrease the calculated allowance. That\u2019s specifically because these are calculations of expected loss to term and terms are shorter and commercial loans then the emergence period approach that we have taken in the past where we anticipated certain amount of renewal. So the net impact will be the net of an increase on the consumer side and a decrease on the commercial side. Based on what I can see today and so as you look from bank to bank I would think about their mix of those things and that probably reflects what their outcome might be as well. We haven\u2019t seen the competition changing loan terms or loan pricing or competing differently for loans that will have a more or less difficult CECL impact. At some point I would expect to see that once people really know how it works. As I mentioned before we don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to work in CCAR and it can be incrementally punitive, right, it can be a doubling up of a big front end loss and that matters. And then lastly, it\u2019s not clear \u2013 crystal clear yet and this matters in CCAR also what the \u2013 how it\u2019s going to feel when people are calculating \u2013 today people are calculating life of loan estimates based on the environment that we are in today. When we are in tougher times we are going to be calculating life of loan expected loss based on those conditions which is going to be worse. I think we are all trying to understand what that means especially in CCAR because you are giving conditions that are worse and so it could be a doubling up. Saul Martinez : Got it, alright, very helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hi, good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, can you guys share with us you talked John, a bit about raising some deposit rates in the wholesale business enables you to grow that deposits at the end of the quarter, can you share with us what that might do for the fourth quarter in terms of deposit growth in that area and also the net interest margin? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So I think we also mentioned that we did that later in the quarter, so you wouldn\u2019t have seen in the interest cost as much in the quarter even though the spot balance at the end of the quarter was up. So all things being equal I would expect us to compete strongly for our wholesale deposits in the fourth quarter and you would expect there to be higher interest costs in the wholesale in the fourth quarter. The growth rates that we are seeing anticipating in wholesale still low single-digits in terms of deposit \u2013 if deposits call it 3% to 4% something like that, the way we price those tends to be very targeted based on relationship. Some of those \u2013 many of our wholesale relationships are sole bank relationships, very rich ones and we are \u2013 it\u2019s important for us to retain those and maintain those. We have got some types of wholesale customers who are sitting on lots of excess liquidity and it\u2019s up to them everyday to think about whether they move it from one bank to another and those deposits incidentally have their own LCR liquidity rating and liquidity value or run off factors that we think about those in a certain way. So just as a little bit of context there is a balance between how much we want to pay for what kind of deposit based on what value it has to Wells Fargo. It\u2019s one thing to retain the relationship which is very important, it\u2019s is something else to just track dollars that sit on our books, but don\u2019t provide a lot of incremental liquidity benefit, but just gross up the size of balance sheet. We have talked about that and the extreme on the FI side where at the beginning of the year we just took those down because they are really just a balance sheet gross up rather than a valuable deposit that we can use to fund loans for example. But Gerard I think it\u2019s really important to put in perspective and we are talking about to put it in perspective. And we are talking about tens of billions of dollars of deposits, it\u2019s not a $1.3 trillion deposits. So, even it increased to be appropriately competitive, as John described, is not going to have a material impact on how much Wells Fargo earns in the fourth quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then coming to the asset side of the balance sheet, when you talk about your commercial and industrial loan portfolio, I think in the second quarter, you indicated that the loans to non-depository financials was about $94.5 billion, what did that grow to in the third quarter? John Shrewsberry : I don\u2019t know yet, but it\u2019s not going to be that much different. I would call it in the plus or minus 90 range. We will call that out at the \u2013 I am going to be speaking at a conference in a couple weeks. I am sure we can probably talk about it then, but that hasn\u2019t changed that much. Those balances will revolve up and down a little bit. I think Erika asked earlier about how much of that is warehousing to securitization, etcetera. So, portions of that will pop up and down a little bit more rather than just layer on top of each other like term types of financing. So, there is some seasonality to it. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then speaking of C&I loans, what was the utilization rate in your traditional C&I credits, are you seeing that creep up or is it sliding down at all? John Shrewsberry : Yes. It\u2019s been super flat in the 40% area for a good, long time. Now, that 40% is the weighted average of a variety of different types of revolving facilities, some of which are generally fully drawn, some of which are seasonally drawn and some of which are never drawn. So, I wouldn\u2019t want you to \u2013 it is a weighted average, but it hasn\u2019t changed in at least the last couple of years as I have looked at the quarter to quarter information which incidentally when we think about the demand for credit, I generally expect that customers use available revolving facilities before negotiating and paying for new incremental available credit and we haven\u2019t seen much of that. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then just lastly, Tim, you and I chatted about this last time on the call about credit and credit quality and comparing it to before the financial crisis. Asking the question a little differently, what kind of influence do you think this CCAR process has had on your organization? I know your credit standards are strong, but when you kind of think back pre-CCAR to today, are the big banks like your own maybe sticking a little more conservatively to the credit metrics because of CCAR than they otherwise would have or is that totally off base? Tim Sloan : I don\u2019t want to speak for other banks. But as it relates to Wells Fargo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s had a material impact on how we underwrite credit at the company. I think we have always been conservative and will continue to be on the conservative side. Some of the more aggressive lending that was done pre-crisis on some bank balance sheets is now being done by non-banks. I think that is both CCAR and other regulatory guidance related than anything, but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s had a material impact. John Shrewsberry : There has been a regulatory impact on what\u2019s on bank balance sheets. Tim Sloan : Right, but not because of CCAR. John Shrewsberry : Not because of CCAR, but so for example, pre-financial crisis, there was a whole range of single-family mortgage credit on the banks of balance sheets, most of which doesn\u2019t exist any longer. So, on banks\u2019 books, it\u2019s mostly prime jumbo. We have got some home equity. But for the modern home equity is a much better risk/reward trade-off than pre-crisis. Credit cards are probably impacted by the CCAR process for certain banks, because they get hit so hard in the severely adverse scenario. As of commercial real estate, where our own very careful steward of how much commercial real estate and what type we want on our books. And then C&I, it\u2019s really around the most leverage lending. There has been agency both Fed and OCC leverage loan guidance which has kept the CCAR banks or at least the OCC banks away from most of that which looks different as a result of regulation, but not necessarily CCAR although we get treated better in CCAR for not having it on the books. Tim Sloan : But Gerard, when you step back and maybe even set CCAR aside, I think overall what you see on our balance sheet today is not only really good credit performance, but a much stronger mix in terms of credit quality even if we would go into some sort of an economic downturn which is one of the reasons why as we provided updates to you all at investor day that we think are through this cycle losses are just lower. John Shrewsberry : Gerard, you didn\u2019t ask this, but the rest of the left side of the balance sheet in terms of securities portfolios, trading portfolios, derivatives NPV, etcetera, those are probably more directly impacted by stretched outcomes for a lot of the CCAR banks because of the treatment that they get in CCAR. And I think the direct link to what capital they attract and what return you have to generate would have caused people to manage those risks differently. Gerard Cassidy : Appreciate all the color. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : Yes. You bet. Tim Sloan : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research, LLC. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Good morning, Nancy. Nancy Bush : Good morning, guys. How are you? Tim Sloan : Good. Nancy Bush : Two questions for you. You have mentioned the overcapacity in the mortgage market and we all know that we have multiple headwinds in that business right now. Given that you have \u2013 I think you announced what a 600 or so headcount reduction in mortgage, is the mortgage company at this point sized for what you see coming and what might change your minds about that? Tim Sloan : So, Nancy, the way that we think about the mortgage business today is that we have got to be able to improve our results based upon the environment that we are in. Our guess and you probably agree with this given that we\u2019ve both seen a few cycles that over time, it\u2019s probably going to improve, but we are in the midst of an overcapacity period today. So, Michael DeVito and the mortgage team, who I think are doing a great job, are looking at the business and trying to see, how can we originate more mortgages? How can we do that at a more efficient way? Part of the way we do that is by introducing technology like the digital mortgage application. And also, it\u2019s not just about origination. It\u2019s also about the servicing side. And what\u2019s happening on the servicing side of the business is as the portfolio quality continues to improve, the portion of the business that was focused on managing modifications or defaults and so just declines because you have lesser need for that. So, I think what you are going to see is a continued improvement in the efficiency of that business, assuming that we are in overall, but particularly in an environment that we are in right now. Nancy Bush : So, basically, you are saying you have built in as of right now the mortgage company is right-sized for what you see coming down the road right now? Tim Sloan : Well, it\u2019s right-sized for today, but our expectation not only for mortgage, but for all of our business and this gets back to John\u2019s comments about how we think about efficiency and expenses is what can we do to improve the returns to the business? So, today, is it? Yes, but are we saying to all of our businesses, what can you do to improve it? Absolutely, that\u2019s how you get down to $50 billion to $51 billion over the next couple of years. Nancy Bush : Okay. Secondly, John, this is probably a question for you, part of your year-over-year decline and expenses was a fairly large decline in operating losses. I think $700 million and something. Now, if my memory serves me right, most of operating losses are fraud losses. Is that still the case? And what\u2019s going on in that decline? John Shrewsberry : Yes. No. So, I would \u2013 we estimate that every year, around $600 million worth of operating losses are the \u2013 as you described, fraud and other standard losses, bank robberies, just things that go wrong in banks. The amount above that is really litigation, remediation. It\u2019s things related to the sales practices outcome and some of the other items that have occurred or been uncovered and then fixed over the last couple of years. So, you\u2019ll see some \u2013 I don\u2019t want to take too much credit. The company shouldn\u2019t take too much credit for the easy comps we have as a result of having had outsized operating losses in the last year or so. But if anything, back to what I would call baseline regular operating losses, they\u2019re probably continuing to tick up over time as fraud efforts are more persistent and more sophisticated. And maybe, particularly, as we become a bigger credit card bank, we\u2019ll be even a little bit more incrementally exposed to that, but that part of the business, that\u2019s a growth risk for banks like Wells Fargo. Nancy Bush : Okay. So, basically, you are saying though that this large year-over-year decline is probably going to flatten out? John Shrewsberry : I think that\u2019s right. And specifically, the third quarter of last year included a $1 billion accrual for the pre-crisis RMBS working group settlement that we ultimately finalized in the last couple of quarters this year. So, that was very idiosyncratic. And that benefit, if you will, wouldn\u2019t be there. Having said that, in the fourth quarter of last year we did take some big litigation reserves, so, in the fourth quarter of this year, given everything that I know, I would expect that same relationship to exist versus fourth quarter of last year. Nancy Bush : Okay, thank you. John Shrewsberry : You are welcome. Tim Sloan : Thanks, Nancy. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hey, Brian. John Shrewsberry : Hey, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi, good morning. One quick question first on the pay downs that you saw in the quarter. I know it\u2019s still a headwind to loan growth overall, but for the pay-downs specifically, was that an acceleration from the previous quarter or did it decelerate and what\u2019s your expectations going forward? Tim Sloan : You\u2019re talking about loan growth or just on loans? Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, just the pay-downs on loans. John Shrewsberry : Commercial real estate. Tim Sloan : In commercial real estate, I would just describe that as being reflective of just the underlying terms and conditions and the duration of the portfolio. John Shrewsberry : And there were some loans that we acquired from the GE commercial real estate acquisition of a few years ago that came to term and got refinanced out into the capital markets, etcetera. So, that\u2019s probably a little bit idiosyncratic. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then the second one, you mentioned that you\u2019re still seeing some good progress with the Propel credit card offering, but you haven\u2019t really put any kind of numbers around that. Is there any way you can quantify what the success has been thus far? Tim Sloan : Well, it\u2019s still early in the process which is why we are being a little bit hesitant in declaring victory. But we are really excited about the performance to date. I think what we are seeing is we are seeing \u2013 which is exciting is that about half of the cards are being originated digitally which is good because we\u2019ve made a lot of investments from a digital standpoint to be able to provide that service and convenience to our customers. I think we are seeing our existing customers be very attracted to the card which is great. But overall, the performance has exceeded our expectations. And we are really, really excited about it. John Shrewsberry : We will probably be more specific after we have a few quarters under our belt to look back and say, here is what it looked like when we were in the first 6 months or 9 months. But I think we mentioned earlier, new accounts in general purpose credit card, including Propel were up 27% linked quarter and 17% year-over-year which is good momentum. Now, that has to translate into spend. It has to translate into balances. Those things are lagging indicators, but the new cards issued were up along the lines of what I mentioned. Tim Sloan : And that\u2019s really, Brian, one of the reasons why we are being somewhat conservative in providing a lot of details because when you think about the business model and returns for that card, you got to see all the additional metrics that John is describing. But the point is so far so good. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great. Thanks. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Well, thanks, you all for listening today, spending time with us. And I also want to shout out to our 260,000 team members. The progress that we are making in transforming Wells Fargo is a reflection of your hard work and effort. And we are very, very focused on achieving all of the six goals that we have for the company. So, thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO and President, Tim Sloan and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn the call over to our CEO and President, Tim Sloan. Tim Sloan : Thank you, John. Good morning. And thank you all for joining us today. 2018 was a year of continued transformation at Wells Fargo. We added impressive new leaders to our team, introduced new products and services for our customers, fundamentally improved risk management, invested billions of dollars in technology and innovation and substantially increased our capital return to shareholders. At the same time, we earned $22.4 billion and $4.28 per diluted common share in 2018, the highest earnings per share in the company\u2019s history. While we faced challenges, I\u2019m so proud of the hard work and the perseverance of our team members. I\u2019m going to highlight some of our accomplishments in 2018 on each of our six goals, starting with our goal to provide exceptional customer service and advice. We sent an average of more than 37 million monthly zero balance and customer specific balance alerts and helped over 2.3 million customers avoid overdraft charges through overdraft rewind in 2018. While these customer friendly initiatives lowered our revenues, they are consistent with our vision of helping our customers succeed financially in building long-term relationships. We also implemented fee waivers for customers affected by natural disasters, including the California wild fires and East Coast hurricanes. And most recently we are supporting customers who are affected by the ongoing government shutdown through fee reversals and other assistance to those who are having difficulties making loan payments. In addition, we\u2019ve made changes to better serve our customers and our branches as we are focused on conversations aimed at helping to better understand their financial needs. These improvements were reflected in both our customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with most recent visit branch survey scores reaching a 24-month high in December. As part of our focus on team member engagement, we increased pay for entry level team members in the U.S. and granted restricted stock rights to approximately 250,000 team members which helps connect their success to what\u2019s important to our shareholders. Our voluntary team member attrition improved to its lowest level in six years in 2018 and we continued to attract new team members from outside the company including our most recently announced Head of Technology Saul Van Beurden, who will join us and join our operating committee and will report to me in April. Our progress on our goal of being a leader in innovation was demonstrated by launching many customer focused products and services in 2018, including our online mortgage application with 30% of all retail applications done online in December. Our CEO mobile for wholesale customers, with half of the users now using biometrics to authenticate; Control tower with more than 90% of debit card on/off requests now handled digitally. Propel, one of the most compelling no annual fee rewards cards in the industry, and most recently, a seven state pilot of Greenhouse, a mobile-first banking account app with innovative cash management functionality. Leadership and Corporate citizenship is one of the six goals because we believe Wells Fargo should play a role in building stronger communities. In 2018, we exceeded our target of donating $400 million to communities across the country, up more than 40% from a year ago, making us one of the top corporate givers in the U.S. A recent example is our holiday food bank program, which in partnership with our customers and team members provided over 50 million meals to those in need. Our goal of delivering long term shareholder value was demonstrated by returning $25.8 billion to shareholders in 2018, up 78% from 2017. Last year, we also established dollar targets for non-interest expense for 2018, 2019 and 2020 to help our shareholders better follow the progress we\u2019re making to become more efficient. We achieved our 2018 expense target and we remain committed to meeting our expense targets for 2019 and 2020. I\u2019ll now turn to risk management and an update on the asset cap, which is part of the consent order we entered into with the Federal Reserve Board in February of last year. There are two parts to the consent order, governance and oversight and compliance and operational risk management. We\u2019ve made meaningful progress on both. We have hired new leaders in key roles including our new Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Head of Regulatory Relations and Chief Operational Risk Officer and our corporate risk management team members grew by approximately 1,300 or 15% in 2018. We invested $1.8 billion on important initiatives as part of our technology expense on cyber, data and risk management. We introduced our risk management framework, which we described in our third quarter 10-Q, which fundamentally transforms how we manage risk throughout the organization in a comprehensive, integrated and consistent manner, and involves team members throughout the company in every line of defense. We changed the composition of our board, including reconstituting several board committees, and amending committee charters to sharpen focus and reduce duplication in the board\u2019s risk oversight. And we enhanced information flow and escalation of matters to the board as well as the reporting and analysis provided to the board. We continue to have a constructive dialogue with the Federal Reserve on an ongoing basis to clarify expectations, receive feedback and assess progress. In order to have enough time to incorporate this feedback in our plans in a thoughtful manner and adopt and implement the final plans as accepted by the Federal Reserve and complete the required third party reviews, we\u2019re now planning to operate under the asset cap through the end of 2019. Making the changes necessary to not only need, but to exceed regulatory expectation remains a top priority, as is continuing to serve our customers and help them succeed financially. We believe that we can achieve both of these priorities, while we operate under the asset cap and our growth in both loans and deposits in the fourth quarter demonstrated our ability to do so. When I assumed the CEO role, I took responsibility for addressing the retail sales practices issue while also pledging to examine every business at Wells Fargo. I assured all of our stakeholders that we would be transparent in our actions and we\u2019ve done that. Nearly all the matters we have recently resolved reflect issues from our past, including the recently announced state attorneys general settlement last month. Regardless of when they occurred, these past matters need to be resolved in the present. The settlements we\u2019ve reached last year and the remediation we provided to customers reflects important progress on our goal to move Wells Fargo forward as quickly as possible, while continuing to provide our customers with high quality service, and advice each and every day. Over the past two years with the full support of our board of directors, we\u2019ve undertaken a massive effort to transform Wells Fargo. In 2019, we will continue to build the most customer focused, efficient and innovative Wells Fargo ever, characterized by a strong financial foundation, a leading presence in markets we serve, focused growth within a strong risk management framework, operational excellence, and highly engaged team members. I\u2019m confident we will succeed, and that these efforts will result in even better Wells Fargo for all of our stakeholders. John Shrewsbury will now discuss our financial results in more detail. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Tim, and good morning everyone. We highlight our fourth quarter results on page two, including earning $6.1 billion or $1.21 per diluted common share and an ROE of 12.89% and an ROTCE of 15.39%. We once again had strong credit quality and high levels of liquidity and capital. We returned $8.8 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, more than double the amount from a year ago. And we had positive business momentum, including one, growing loans in deposits on both an average and period and basis from the third quarter; two, increasing primary consumer checking customers by 1.2% from a year ago net of the previously disclosed sale of 52 branches that closed in the fourth quarter, reducing this growth rate by 0.5%. Three, increasing card usage with debit card purchase volume up 8% and consumer general purpose credit card purchase volume up 5% from a year ago; four, growing loan originations year-over-year in auto by 9%, home equity by 14%, small business by 19% and student lending by 16%. And five, reducing expenses and meeting our 2018 expense targets. On Page three, we highlight noteworthy items in the fourth quarter. Our earnings of $6.1 billion included a $614 million gain on the sale of $.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans, $432 million of operating losses, which included $175 million accrual for the agreement reached in December with all 50 state attorneys general and the District of Columbia regarding previously disclosed consumer matters, a $372 million adjustment, negative net MSR valuation adjustment for servicing and foreclosure costs, discount rates and prepayment estimates recognized as a result of recent market observations related to an acceleration of prepayments, including for VA loans and market participants current valuation of MSRs. These adjustments were not related to our ongoing interest rate hedging, and so hedging program performed as intended to protect against interest rate changes in the fourth quarter. A $200 million reserve release reflecting continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio, and while it didn\u2019t impact our earnings, deferred compensation, which is impacted by equity market pricing reduced fees by $452 million and reduced expenses by $428 million in the fourth quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 13.7% which included $158 million of net discrete income tax benefits primarily related to the results of state income tax audits and incremental state tax credits, and $137 million benefit related to revisions and our full year 2018 effective income tax rate made in the quarter. We highlight our full year results on page four, compared with 2017, revenues declined from lower fee income, primarily driven by $1.3 billion decline in mortgage banking, primarily due to lower gains on mortgage originations, a $620 million decline in insurance reflecting the sale of Wells Fargo insurance services, and $395 million decline in deposit service charges driven by the customer friendly changes we\u2019ve implemented, which have reduced fees, together with a higher ECR for commercial customers. The increase in net interest income was driven by a higher margin, which more than offset declines in earning assets and a shift in loan mix to lower yielding, higher quality assets. Expenses declined, driven by lower operating losses. We also had lower expenses in a number of other categories, including outside professional services, outside data processing and travel and entertainment. We continued to have strong credit performance due to a number of factors including the efforts to de-risk the loan portfolio by running off or selling higher risk consumer loans while growing higher quality assets. And our capital levels remained quite strong, while we reduced common shares outstanding by 6%. I\u2019ll be highlighting the balance sheet drivers on page 5 throughout the call, so I\u2019ll now turn to page six. On page six, I\u2019d like to highlight that our 2013 full year effective income tax rate was 20.2% or 18% before discrete items. We currently expect the effective income tax rate for full year 2019 to be approximately 18% excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items. Average loans increased $6.8 billion from the third quarter, the first linked quarter increase since fourth quarter of 2016 with growth in the commercial portfolio partially offset by continued declines in consumer specifically auto and home equity. Period end loans increased $10.8 billion from the third quarter, but were down $3.7 billion from a year ago, as we sold or transferred to held for sale $8.4 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans and reliable financial services loans in 2018. Let me explain period end loan trends in more detail, starting with the commercial portfolio on page eight. Commercial loans grew $10 billion from a year ago, and $11.5 billion from the third quarter. C&I loans have grown for five consecutive quarters and increased $12.2 billion from the third quarter. This growth was broad based across a number of our wholesale businesses and was largely to investment grade, corporate credits and high quality middle market borrowers. Our growth benefited from strong M&A based financing and to a lesser extent from weaker capital market conditions for debt issuances. Our pipeline suggests continued C&I growth in 2019 although not at the rate we have seen in the fourth quarter of 2018. Commercial real estate loans were down $583 million from the third quarter and it declined for seven consecutive quarters, reflecting continued credit discipline and competitive in the highly liquid markets and pay downs of existing and acquired loans. We anticipate these market factors will continue to impact portfolio balances in the near term. As we show on page nine, consumer loans declined $709 million from the third quarter and included the sale of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans in the fourth quarter. We had $4.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans remaining at year-end. Despite the PCI loan sale, the first mortgage loan portfolio increased $792 million from the third quarter. We had $9.8 billion of non-conforming mortgage loan originations in the fourth quarter excluding $562 million that were designated as held for sale in anticipation of future issuance of RMBS. Junior lean mortgage loans continued to decline as originations were more than offset by pay downs, primarily by loans originated prior to 2009. Credit card loans increased $1.2 billion from the third quarter driven by seasonality as well as growth in active accounts including the Propel card. Auto loan balances were down $1 billion from the third quarter due to expected continued run-off. Due to the sale of reliable, auto originations were down 1% from the third quarter, but they were up 9% from a year ago, reflecting our focus on growing high quality auto loans following the transformational changes we made to the business. We currently expect auto portfolio balances to begin growing by the middle of this year. Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $776 million from the third quarter reflecting lower securities based lending, student loans and personal loans and lines. Average deposits declined $42.7 billion from a year ago reflecting both lower wholesale banking deposits, including actions taken in the first half of the year to manage to the asset gap and lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher rate alternatives. Average deposits rose $2.5 billion from the third quarter as increases in wholesale banking deposits were partially offset by lower consumer and small business banking deposits, which included $1.8 billion of deposits associated with the sale of 52 branches at the end of November. On page 11, we show what has happened with deposit beta since the Fed started increasing rates in 2015, our cumulative beta since the start of the cycle was 32% and the cumulative beta over the past year was 38% which was above the experience for the first 100 basis point increase in the fed funds rate. Wholesale deposit repricing was aligned with historical experience, while retail deposits have repriced slower than historical experience through the end of 2018. On page 12, we thought we provide details on Period-end deposits which increased $19.6 billion from the third quarter. Wholesale banking deposits were up $10.6 billion from the third quarter, with strong inflows late in the period while consumer and small business banking deposits increased $8.5 billion, which included wealth and investment management, small business banking and retail banking. Wealth and investment management deposits increased for the first time in three quarters, driven by higher retail brokerage sweep deposits, and private banking deposits partially reflecting our customers change in risk appetite given market volatility at the end of the quarter. Net interest income increased $72 million from the third quarter, driven primarily by the benefits of higher average interest rates and favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, partially offset by the impacts from balance sheet mix and lower variable income. While the change in balance sheet mix negatively impacted net interest income, it also reflected an increasing proportion of higher quality lower risk loans on the balance sheet. Our NIM was stable linked quarter and up 10 basis points from a year ago. Non-interest income declined $1 billion from the third quarter, driven by lower market sensitive revenue, mortgage banking fees, interest and investment fees partially offset by higher other income which included $117 million gain from the sale of 52 branches. The decline in market sensitive revenue was driven by lower gains from equity securities, which declined $395 million. Deferred compensation reduced gains from equity securities by $570 million from the third quarter, which was partially offset by higher gains from our venture capital and private equity partnerships. Trading gains declined $148 million and total trading revenue which we summarized on Page 32 of the supplement was down $123 million driven by credit spreads widening. It was a volatile market in the fourth quarter, however, our trading book performed as we would expect in that environment. Mortgage banking revenue declined $379 million from the third quarter as a result of lower servicing income, and lower net gains on mortgage loans, originations and sales. The decline in servicing income was driven by the negative net MSR valuation adjustments that I highlighted earlier. The decline in mortgage origination gains reflected $8 billion of seasonally lower originations, and we expect originations in the first quarter to be seasonally low as well. The production margin decreased to 89 basis points primarily due to lower retail margins, partially offset by a lower percentage of correspondent volume. We still have not seen any significant capacity being removed from the market and we expect the production margin in the first quarter to remain in the range of the past two quarters of 2018. Given the ongoing competitiveness in the mortgage market, we\u2019re focused on improving the customer experience and reducing cost. Trust in investment fees declined $111 million from the third quarter on lower investment banking results due to the lower advisory, equity and debt underwriting, and lower asset base fees from market valuations. Turning to expenses on page 15, expenses declined from both the third quarter and a year ago. I\u2019ll expand the drivers in more detail starting on page 16. Expenses were down $424 million or 3% from the third quarter. The decline was driven by reduced compensation and benefits expense due to negative deferred compensation expense. Expenses also declined due to lower running the business non-discretionary expense, driven by lower FDIC expense, following the completion of the FDIC special assessment. Also operating losses declined partially offset by a pension plan settlement expense in the fourth quarter. Of the categories where expenses increased, many are typically higher in the fourth quarter including advertising and promotion, travel and entertainment and outside professional services. As we show on page 17, expenses were down $3.5 billion from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses. On page 18, we show total non-interest expense in 2018, a $56.1 billion, which included $3.1 billion of operating losses. We met our 2018 expense target with $53.6 billion of non-interest expense, which excludes $2.5 billion of operating losses in excess of $600 million. We are on track to meet our expense targets for 2019 and 2020. On page 19 we highlight some of the actions we took in 2018 to improve efficiency. There are three primary areas we are focused on as part of our efficiency efforts. Centralization and optimization includes the work we completed across the company centralizing staff functions as well as the work we started with our contact centers to improve the customer experience, which includes both the consolidation of centers into hub locations and technology simplification. Our work will continue during this year, which is expected to result in additional cost savings as well as reduced customer transfers and wait times. We\u2019ve made significant changes in how we\u2019re running many of our consumer and wholesale businesses, including streamlining the retail mortgage sales organization, eliminating layers and reengineering the mortgage fulfillment process, which reduce home lending headcount by 5000 in 2018. The changes we\u2019ve made to our branches resulting from the changing from changing customer preferences reduce branch headcount by over 2800 in 2018, with additional reductions expected this year. We\u2019re also restructuring our wholesale businesses to be more aligned around the customer, which has reduced duplication and enabled greater consolidation of operations and applications. Our third area of focus is on governance and controls, which includes reducing third party consulting spend, consolidating manager positions as part of a more consistent approach to span of control across the company and continuing to drive more efficient projects spend through a rigorous investment optimization process. While we made meaningful progress on our efficiency in 2018 there are significant ongoing efforts being implemented across the company, reflecting changing customer preferences and our focus on efficiency. Our goal is to realize sustainable cost reductions through operational excellence, which is expected to reduce headcount by 5% to 10% as we previously announced. Headcount reduction in 2018 included approximately 60% from voluntary team member attrition and future reductions are also expected to come from a combination of voluntary attrition and displacement. Turning to our business segment starting on page 20, community banking earnings increased $353 million from the third quarter, driven by lower operating losses and income tax expense. On page 21, we provide updated community banking metrics. Teller and ATM transactions declined 5% from a year ago, reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels. As planned, we completed 300 branch consolidations in 2018 and sold 52 branches in the fourth quarter. At year end, we had 29.2 million digital active customers up 4% from a year ago, which includes mobile active customer growth of 7%. Primary consumer checking customers have grown year-over-year for five consecutive quarters and growth in new checking customers continue to be driven by digital. With new checking customers acquired from the digital channel more than doubling from a year ago. On page 22, we highlight our strong growth in credit and debit card purchase volume. As Tim highlighted at the start of the call, both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with the most recent visit branch survey scores reached a 24-month high in December with steady improvement over the past six months. Turning to page 23, wholesale banking earnings declined $180 million from the third quarter driven by lower trading gains, investment banking fees and other income, which was partially, offset by higher loan fees and commercial real estate brokerage commissions. Wealth and investment management earnings declined $43 million from the third quarter. Volatility in the equity markets during the fourth quarter impacted results, but helped to drive period end deposit growth. Also, as a reminder, retail brokerage advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth quarter results reflected the higher September 30th market valuations and first quarter 2019 results will reflect a lower December 31st market valuations. Turning the Page 25, we recognize that this credit cycle has lasted longer than most, and we remain vigilant regarding credit risk. However, we continued to have strong credit results with a net charge-off rate of 30 basis points in the fourth quarter. For the fifth consecutive quarter, all of our commercial and consumer real estate loan portfolios were in a net recovery position and non-performing assets declined $280 million or 4% from the third quarter and were down 16% from a year ago. Turning to Page 26, our CET1 ratio fully faced phased-in declined 20 basis points from the third quarter due to common stock dividends and net share repurchases, but it remained well above regulatory minimums and is aligned with our plan of prudently managing toward our internal target of 10%. We repurchased 142.7 million shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter some of which were purchased as a part of a 10b5-1 program we initiated during the quarter. While we were pleased to return $25.8 billion to shareholders in 2018 our CET1 ratio was down only 30 basis points from a year ago as RWA improvements, including the regulatory guidance covering high volatility commercial real estate, as well as declines in RWA from changes in balance sheet mix to lower risk assets benefited our capital position. Similar to prior years, we will be assessing our current and projected level of access capital as one of the many key considerations in the evaluation of future capital distributions as part of our capital adequacy assessment in this year\u2019s capital plan. So, in summary, in 2019 we plan to continue focusing on transforming Wells Fargo into a better bag, by improving risk management and customer service making Wells Fargo a great place to work, launching industry leading innovation, contributing to our communities and creating long term shareholder value. We\u2019ll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Tim Sloan : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Good morning. I wanted to ask first about the asset cap, because that seems to have taken your stock a leg down Tim when you announced it would be in place at the end of 2019. And I guess this is a two part question. One is the extension and expectation for the asset cap, does that reflect progress relative to your expectations towards the consent orders that are slower than you thought you would achieve regardless of the absolute level of progress? And second, if you could remind investors especially given the different sales that you\u2019ve been doing in your Pick-a-Pay book, how the asset cap being in place in 2019, what any incremental impact that would have on the revenue outlook if any at all? Tim Sloan : Sure. Both really good questions Erika, and thanks Erika. Thank you for asking them. Let me just level set right, in that a lot of the dialogue that we have with the Fed is covered by a confidential supervisory information, so I want to be very careful in the feedback I\u2019m providing. But, I want to reiterate that we continue to have very frequent and constructive dialogue with the Fed, and we\u2019re both working towards the same goal, which is that we want to have best-in-class risk management period. As you would recall, the consent order has two main topics. One is corporate governance. And the second is compliance and operational risk management. And each of these have multiple work streams behind them. The plans that we provided are very comprehensive, involve extensive documentation, which takes time to review and to process. So the feedback that we\u2019re getting from the Fed is very detailed and the outlook we\u2019re providing uses the best judgment that we have in terms of how long the process will take. But at the same time, we\u2019re continuing to actively work and implement the new risk management framework, as I mentioned, we detailed that in our third quarter 10-Q and as well as incorporating the input that we\u2019re getting back from the Fed along the way. And from my perspective, we\u2019re making good progress. It\u2019s just taking a little bit longer than what we had originally anticipated. But, to your second question, I think the fourth quarter results reinforce our ability particularly when you look at loan growth, and you net out the impact of the legacy loan portfolios for example, in Pick-a-Pay from the asset sales or the decline in pre 2009 home equity portfolio. But when we factor that out, what you saw is our ability to serve our customers by providing them credit. You saw our deposit growth continue. And so our view is that we\u2019re going to be able to operate under the asset cap, meet and exceed the expectations of the Federal Reserve as it relates to our requirements under the asset cap and serve our customers, because again, we\u2019re in complete agreement with the Fed about what needs to be done and we\u2019re in the midst of implementing that. So we\u2019re making progress. It\u2019s just happening a little bit slower than we had originally anticipated, but we\u2019ll get there. Erika Najarian : Thank you for that. My second question has to do with the expense outlook relative to the revenue outlook, which seems to be downgraded by the market for the bank, for banks in general. So if the Fed, we are in a Fed pause or a stop as of December, I\u2019m wondering if there would be any more flex in the expenses beyond what we\u2019ve been given -- given an absolute basis particularly as the market is getting a little bit more downbeat about market sensitive revenues. Tim Sloan : Sure. So let me start and then John can jump in. I think first, we were really pleased to be able to achieve the expense targets that were promised to all last summer at Investor Day, right. And we want to reiterate today, and I hope you appreciated hearing that from both John and me, and I\u2019ll say it a third time that our goal is to hit and achieve the expense targets that we provided you not only for this year, but through 2020. Having said that, we certainly appreciate that the market is dynamic, the economy is dynamic, there\u2019s lots of change that are going on, and to the extent that, that we see opportunities to take additional or make additional expense saves, we\u2019re going to go ahead and do that. That may be generated by the fact that we see the opportunities or if revenues might be a little bit lower. But when we look at the economy today, and we look at our performance for the fourth quarter, we feel cautiously optimistic about 2019. So again, I think that our goal is to meet the expectations that we set for you as it relates to expenses for 2019, and 2020. If we do need to do more, of course, we\u2019ll go ahead and do that. John, I don\u2019t know if you want to provide any more\u2026 John Shrewsberry : And if there are specific areas of the business that because of something that\u2019s happening more broadly, are not living up to expectations that we would we would focus in on that and take the appropriate action to make sure that we were right sized for what the medium to long term opportunity is. But, there is a -- as you\u2019ll appreciate there is a list of literally hundreds of items that are underway to deliver the results that were, that were promising, and people are working hard to deliver that. Everything should be on the table. But there\u2019s -- there\u2019s a lot to do just to deliver against what we\u2019ve promised. If as you described there is a certain business or a certain area, a certain sector of our business that\u2019s incrementally underperforming because of something is different in 2019 and 2020 than what we anticipated, and then we would take the appropriate action. Erika Najarian : And one last question to slip in there. We ask this of your peers this morning. As we think about the Fed on pause, how should we think about the net interest income trajectory for 2019? John Shrewsberry : Yes, so Fed on pause if it\u2019s true is part of it. I think every dealer I\u2019ve looked at, has two rate increases built into their forecasts for 2019. So we\u2019ll see whether that happens or not. But, just as important from my perspective is what happened to the long end of the curve, because it\u2019s come rallying back down, and that is critical, just because of the magnitude of our collective investment portfolios and reinvestment requirements that will make a difference. What happens with deposit flows will matter, what happens especially in the retail space with deposit pricing among larger banks, which as we\u2019ve pointed out has sort of outperformed historical benchmarks. And then what the appetite is for loan growth. We saw great loan growth in the fourth quarter some of that I think was either seasonal or reflecting what was going on in markets in the fourth quarter, which caused people to turn to their banks even more than they otherwise would have. But if we have -- if we have strongest loan growth that will be supportive, but if deposit prices start on the retail side start picking up, then that will -- that will run in the other direction. So I think we\u2019ll be, we\u2019ll be thrilled to see some, some measurable or even meaningful interest rate interest income growth in 2019. But a lot has to happen for that to work out. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Morning, John. John McDonald : Hi good morning guys. John, wanted to just follow up on Erika\u2019s last question there. So any change to your NII sensitivity that\u2019s occurred if you could give us an update there? And I guess, at the current level of deposit beta, do you see a modest benefit still from a hike, and then, you know if you don\u2019t see a hike, is it really just come down to the loan growth and what we know in a quarter where there\u2019s no rate hike, does NIM kind of trend flattish? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re still in the middle of our \u2013 we\u2019ve actually taken some actions to remain in the middle of our -- of our forecast and guidance for interest rate sensitivity. And to the extent that there are no hikes, in my mind the big question is, well what happens with the catch up from prior hikes and deposit costs? So if we -- if the market -- if big banks in particular, but if the market starts edging up what they\u2019re paying for deposits with Fed funds not moving, with new assets not repricing up at the same time. Then that would have a compressing outcome. We haven\u2019t seen as much of that, but there was a belief that we were going to keep on this trajectory for a little bit longer in terms of rate hikes. I\u2019ll be interested to see what where things settle out. If the Fed funds target is not moving. And then as you say, loan growth will be a part of it in what\u2019s happening. If the absence of hikes is a reflection of things slowing down, then you might expect to see that in a loan growth as well although we didn\u2019t see it in the fourth quarter. And then as I mentioned to Erika don\u2019t just kind of the importance of what\u2019s going on with loan rates, because the curve has been flattening well, short rates have been coming up especially in the fourth quarter when we -- when we came crashing down well below 3%, and that really contributes on all of this incremental liquidity that keeps getting reinvested. If it\u2019s getting reinvested, 50 basis points below where it might have been, or where you might have thought it was, at the beginning of December, then that has an impact also. But we\u2019re still asset sensitive. An increase in the Fed funds target would have a predictable upward impact. The absence of it worried a little bit, but again, it depends on then what happens with deposit pricing. John McDonald : Okay. And not trying to tie you down to a point estimate here, but just trying to get a sense of how you feel going into the year, you kept in 2018 and I was relatively flat with some ups and downs and rates and long growth. Do you feel better about the ability to grow net interest income in 2019 with maybe some of the abatement of runoff in the loan book and then the rate sensitivity that you just described? Do you feel like you can grow net interest income by some amount in 2019? John Shrewsberry : I think we can. But it\u2019s the puts and takes as the things that as mentioned are all going to bear on that. I agree. We suffered a little bit of an interest income in 2018 by selling higher yielding assets, as part of this migration to higher credit quality profile overall. And so, there\u2019s some amount of that excess or extra interest income that is in 2018. It\u2019s a tough comp over 2017 and will be less of a -- we won\u2019t be comping over that in 2019. But, but I think, it has more to do with what happens with the general level of asset credit of loan growth and what happens to deposit pricing. Tim Sloan : Hey, John. Just to reemphasize a point and that is I think we feel very good about our ability to impact net interest income in terms of what we can control, which is our ability to grow deposits. Our ability to provide good service to grow the number of primary checking account relationships our ability to grow loans, and as John pointed out, the lessening impact of the legacy portfolios or for example the credit decisions and the transformation that we made in our auto business, which John pointed out it\u2019s -- it's what we don\u2019t control, which is where the short end of the curve is going to be and the long end of the curve, and what the slope is going to be that is more of a question mark. But in terms of our ability to serve our customers, and to provide them credit and grow deposits we feel good about that. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hi, Marty. John Shrewsberry : Good morning, Marty. Marty Mosby : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch base with you because, talking about revenues, but yet really the two catalysts for the improvement in profitability as you outlined last summer were really the ability to deploy capital and the ability to bring your expenses back in line with what you would think your long term kind of normalized level would be. You\u2019re making progress on the expenses and you\u2019re continuing to kind of push towards the goal that you had. Capital side in that last slide that you have you have here, you\u2019re talking about your Tier 1 common ratio. And while I was wanting to make sure is that as we\u2019re looking at that and we\u2019re thinking of eventually getting to CECL incorporation. Going from 11.7 down to 10, are you already kind of mentally at least got an estimate that says okay, we have to reallocate a certain amount from this accounting principle, or how would you think about that between the 170 [ph] points between those two numbers? John Shrewsberry : Yes actually, there\u2019s been a couple of opportunities over the last year as CECL\u2019s been coming into clearer focus as well as the what the stress capital buffer will mean when it\u2019s fully implemented. And it\u2019s caused us to say that the 10% which is our -- which is our current stated target probably has a bias slightly to the upside when those two things are fully understood especially in the stressed context. You know sort of CECL and business as usual and then there\u2019s the impact of CECL and stress testing which is not fully understood yet. But it\u2019s our \u2013 it\u2019s our guess that before we get to 10% there\u2019s a likelihood that we readjust that target to be slightly higher than 10%. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s 10.25, or 10.375 [ph] or whatever the right number is. But, we\u2019ll know more as stress capital buffer is really finally understood. And as CECL on its own, and CECL in stress are fully understood. At the moment in business as usual, the impact of CECL would not require any massive reallocation of our capital, it may cause us to think a little bit differently about loan structures or loan pricing for certain types of particularly longer dated things, and maybe even more particularly on the consumer side. But, but from a capital allocation process, outside of its impact and stress, which is not yet fully understood, it\u2019s hard to be more specific than that. Marty Mosby : And then with the -- pullback in stock prices that we\u2019ve had, you were able to bring down your share count by 3% linked quarter, which is a 12% annualized type of number. So looking at the ability to actually bring down share account given kind of where we\u2019re trading now puts you up in that double digit ability to kind of bring down your share. So at least for the foreseeable future while you have excess capital above either of those types of targets, is that kind of the right pace, that you would think you\u2019d see in the share count reduction? John Shrewsberry : I\u2019d be cautious about that. We mentioned when we had our capital plan not objected to that we were intentionally front end loading our share buybacks or more of it would happen in the first two quarters, which were Q3 and Q4 of 2018, and less of it would happen in the second two quarters, which is Q1 and Q2 of 2019 just to get the share count down, now that now because of what\u2019s happened to the market, to banks etcetera, our shares are even more attractive today. But there isn\u2019t the capacity under our capital plan in Q1 and Q2 to take the countdown or to deploy the amount of capital that we were deploying in Q3 and Q4. That will be -- as I mentioned in my remarks we\u2019re now in the process of thinking about what our 2019 capital plan will be. And to the extent that that RWA growth rates are relatively constrained, we\u2019re predicting ample levels of organic capital generation etcetera, it\u2019s likely but it\u2019s not unlikely that our capital plan for next year looks something like what it did last year. And so if we roll the tape forward, you might anticipate something like that. All other things being equal subject and not objection etcetera to get ahead of myself. Marty Mosby : Oh well thanks. a lot. [indiscernible] worked out well with the way that the stock prices went then? Tim Sloan : Well you can. I mean, when you\u2019re buying back that number of shares you can never really buy the bottom tech right. You have to be methodically maybe in the market every day. And, and so it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a math exercise to get it done. Marty Mosby : Yes it is. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead. John Pancari : Good morning. On the loan growth side I just want to see regarding the fourth quarter trends, wanted to get a little bit more color on how you\u2019re thinking about how much of that fourth quarter strength in growth is possibly transient given the moves in the bond markets and everything versus what\u2019s sticky, and what here can really gain? Can we really see gaining a momentum of from here on out or is there likely to be some moderation off of what is viewed as a very strong quarter in terms of production? Thanks. Tim Sloan : Well I\u2019ll start and then John can jump in. I think to the extent that we had an impact from the capital markets shutting down in December. It happened obviously in the C&I book, and there was some portion of that. I think it\u2019s hard to say that it was exactly a billion dollars or exactly two billion dollars. But -- but there\u2019s no question there a portion of that was related to the market that the other another portion of it candidly was related to the fact that we saw some high quality deal activity that we were involved in. Now I recall the first quarter tends to be a little bit seasonally lower for the entire industry. That may not happen this year. We don\u2019t know, but I think that\u2019s important to recognize. On the consumer side, obviously there was no impact, so that the consumer growth that we saw really across the board when you think about it with the exception of the slight pullback we had in an auto because of the sale of reliable, was actually pretty good. So I think we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow loans in throughout all of next year. But, if it was a few billion dollars, I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable estimate. John, I don\u2019t know if you have any more detail on that. John Shrewsberry : So I do some of it was investment grade companies choosing not to pay up in the bond market and turning to the banks and using facilities, those I would assume would abate over a period of time, as high grade markets open up and people have easy and inexpensive access. Some of it\u2019s seasonal. We\u2019ve on the commercial side, we had deal or types of financing where people were building inventory and that will be a seasonal effect on the consumer side. Card tends to have a seasonal run up in the fourth quarter as people borrow for holiday related activities, so that might that might just naturally seasonally roll down. But we\u2019re just moving forward into the first quarter. We\u2019re seeing more interesting M&A activity happening among our clients, than we saw in the fourth quarter. Some of that\u2019s going to lead to interesting on balance sheet financing opportunities for us. And so I wouldn\u2019t consider that to be as transitory as you might imagine. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then secondly on the -- on the credit side, a lot of concerns here around late cycle conditions in everything, and I just want to see if you can give a little bit of color on what you\u2019re seeing. Are you seeing any evidence anecdotally of late cycle behavior in your borrowers? And then related to that, I know you can\u2019t comment on specific borrowers, but can you comment in general on utility exposure just given the PG&E bankruptcy? Thanks. Tim Sloan : So in terms of the first part of your question, no, we\u2019re looking for signs of really being in the late cycle. I think we\u2019ve been all assuming and we\u2019ve -- I think we\u2019ve had this conversation now for the last four years that we\u2019ve been right in the cycle. And that hasn\u2019t changed. But we\u2019re really not seeing any significant evidence of significant increase in delinquencies, an increase in criticized classified. You saw non-performing numbers continue to go down, you know our commercial and residential real estate continues to be in a net recovery position. John Shrewsberry : More commercial real estate activity is getting done away because of [indiscernible]. Tim Sloan : Exactly right. But having said that, I think one of the hallmarks of the risk management of this company is that we are very disciplined in terms of how we make credit risk decisions, period. We\u2019re not going to do anything that\u2019s going to put this company at risk regardless of where we think we are in the cycle. It means that we sometimes, we miss some of the highs, but we\u2019re absolutely there for the lows, for our customers just like in the quarter when the capital markets seized up, we were there providing credit to all of our customers that needed it. I don\u2019t have the total exposure to the utility industry that we have, clearly there\u2019s an idiosyncratic event that\u2019s going on with one of our customers PG&E, because of the horrific fires that occurred in Northern California in the last year. But that, that exposure is absolutely manageable for the company. I mean, don\u2019t forget we\u2019ve got a $950 billion loan portfolio and anyone credit is not going to drive the results of the company. John Pancari : Right. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hey, Matt. John Shrewsberry : Hey Matt. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was hoping to follow up on expenses. I appreciate there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces this quarter, but it seems like when we strip out some of the noise, the costs were coming in a little bit higher than we would have thought. And it\u2019s probably best illustrated on slide 17 here. When we look year-over-year and there really isn\u2019t progress being made when you exclude the unusually high operating losses. And then the deferred compensation expense is kind of just an accounting thing as you mentioned its offset by lower revenues. So I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m thinking about that right. But, it doesn\u2019t, it seems like costs on a core basis maybe a little bit higher this quarter even though revenues a little bit weaker. So one, want to see if you\u2019d agree or if there\u2019s any other things and costs that maybe we\u2019re missing. And then, the follow up would just be as we think about the trajectory in 2019, are the causes to be back ended or relatively even throughout the year. John Shrewsberry : So there\u2019s a couple of things at work. One is, the actions taken during 2018 that that have a cost takeout happened throughout the course of the year. So the impact to them is felt partially in 2018 and more completely in 2019. Incidentally, the same thing is true in 2019 where we\u2019ve got activity happening every month that contributes to the -- to the forecasted number for 2019 and is a stepping off point for the forecasted number in 2020. And there as I mentioned, hundreds of line items that contribute to that. The countervailing activity is the amount that we\u2019re continuing to invest in compliance risk management technology etcetera, some of which is some of which will create a permanent baseline and some of which is temporarily elevated to the extent that it\u2019s very project oriented or supplemented by people from the outside etcetera. All of those are captured in the full year hard dollar targets. But you can\u2019t you, can\u2019t see the ins and outs of what\u2019s sort of the permanent cost takeout versus what\u2019s the 2018 or 2019 investment that\u2019s being made to build capability where we need it. So, so in our forecast for 2019 you\u2019ll see this, but we see the component pieces of these costs running off being based on actions that were taken previously and the impact of net new capability, new people we mentioned there were 1800 new risk personnel I think Tim mentioned that were added during the course of 2018, but all of those contribute to the, to the target for 2018, the target for 2019 and the target for 2020. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay, and then just on this -- the deferred compensation expense, I think that helped the expense say hearings for 2018. Is that something we should be mindful that could go the other way in 2019, and increase the costs versus the target, or? John Shrewsberry : You wouldn\u2019t expect a -- I mean we shouldn\u2019t expect a big, another 10% correction downtick in the market, which drove this particular outcome. On the other hand, you probably wouldn\u2019t expect, we wouldn\u2019t expect a full reversal and a commensurate rally on the other side. So I think it\u2019s harder to imagine it gapping upward, it\u2019s easy to imagine it gapping downwards, but it\u2019ll always \u2013 it\u2019s always been an adjustment that we, that we end up talking about, to the extent that it becomes the swing item in the quarter or for the year that we\u2019re pointing to say, but for that we would have hit our target or we won\u2019t, we certainly won\u2019t take credit for what you did, what we all know as a P&L neutral outcome to achieve a goal that is designed to be achieved the hard way, which is by managing expenses. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay, yes, I\u2019m only harping on it because this quarter, if I add that back to your core costs it seems like the cost came in higher. But that\u2019s kind of the avenue is going down. Can I just ask as we think about full year 2019 and drivers of fee revenues, some categories are going to be market dependent, but can you just talk about which categories are optimistic in growing? There\u2019s been some changes as you mentioned on the checking account, and I think it\u2019s the rewind program, but you\u2019re probably lapping that. So maybe just tick off some of the bigger fee categories where you\u2019re hopeful of getting directionally some growth? Thank you. John Shrewsberry : So as you mentioned and for the reasons you mentioned, I think in service charges, we should be lapping over the periods that where we introduced these customer friendly items. So I would expect that to represent the fact that we\u2019re adding more customers all the time and customers are doing more with us all the time. Same with card fees. I -- just based on the way this year is beginning, I think there\u2019s an opportunity in investment banking. I think the market linked advisory type of revenue on both in wealth and asset management are going to reflect the S&P environment as you said those are market sensitive. Mortgage personnel, of course now we\u2019re because of the seasonality and this low gain on sale environment representing excess capacity will improve either because we do more volume or will and/or will improve because capacity comes out of the system, and we can control to some extent the volume that we do we can\u2019t control the market clearing price for it. But we\u2019re always working hard to gain share. Lease on the income, I would expect to grow because we continue to put more assets on the books and to grow that business. So those are some of the bits and pieces is obviously the other fees, loan charges, cash network fees, wire transfers things like that, that should continue to represent us doing more business with customers. Tim Sloan : Yes, Matt, the big question mark is mortgage. And it\u2019s about capacity, and the size of the market. We\u2019ve seen ups and downs in the mortgage business for the decades that we\u2019ve been a leader in it. We\u2019ll get through this. There\u2019s no question about it. But I just want to re-emphasize John\u2019s point, and that is that we have got to operate that business and I think Michael DeVito and Mary Mack are doing a great job in doing that. We\u2019ve got to operate that business for the environment we\u2019re in. So given the environment we\u2019re in, as John mentioned in his comments, we\u2019ve got to continue to grow our share with our customer base by providing better service, which their folks are really focused on. And then by reducing costs period, right. And, and we believe, we\u2019re going to make progress in that environment. But again, as it relates to gain on sale margins, that\u2019s really going to be a function of capacity in the market. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay, thank you very much. Tim Sloan : Welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hey, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hey good morning. A couple of questions again on the expenses but is there a way to kind of flesh out the numbers with regards to what was showing up in the other I know you called out that there was a pension settlement in there, you also called out that there was lease impairment in there. But can you put some actual numbers around those items? John Shrewsberry : Yes, the sum of the two of them were probably $250 million, $220 million. That\u2019s helpful. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then also, was there any impact from leverage lending on the -- in this quarter as well and I\u2019m assuming [ph] you\u2019ve given your overall exposure, but can you give your overall exposure to leverage lending in the industry? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So I think Perry, at the last Investor Day, had a particular slide that to demonstrate where our -- where we stand in terms of leadership positions in the most leverage LBO transactions in particular which just was to make the point that it\u2019s not really a core business of wholesale banking. It\u2019s a little tricky, because our bread and butter middle market customer often gets tagged under leveraged lending guidance as the leverage loan even though it doesn\u2019t exhibit the same either leverage characteristics or structural or governance or other characteristics of a -- of a sponsor owned LBO borrower. We -- we don\u2019t have huge exposure, but particularly at the end of the year to two most recent LBO financings. We I think it was mentioned, it\u2019s been noteworthy that in the quarter we were on a ranger on -- on one deal that ended up getting hung because it was in the energy sector. We don\u2019t, we don\u2019t have much of a pipeline going into the fourth quarter for that. We don\u2019t consider it to be. It wasn\u2019t a contributor to loan growth in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s not a, it\u2019s not a core activity. So that\u2019s how I would describe it. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. John Shrewsberry : Good morning, Gerard Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, guys. Tim, you were very clear about the underwriting that Wells has done over the years, and your credit quality shows one of the best in the industry. Is there any truth -- or not truth or -- what are your thoughts we always get this end of cycle question that you heard today. And do you think the CCAR process has changed to this length of the cycle where the industry is just stronger now because everybody\u2019s been going through the stress tests every year aside from yourselves, of course? Tim Sloan : Well I think it would go beyond just CCAR. Gerard, I mean, I think, I think the entire regulatory environment post the great recession has fundamentally changed the quality of assets on the balance sheets of the entire industry. I\u2019d love to tell you it\u2019s idiosyncratic to Wells Fargo, which by the way I still think it is. But in addition to that, I think the balance sheets of the banks today are stronger than they\u2019ve ever been. Not just only as it relates to credit, but certainly as it relates to liquidity. And there\u2019s no question that we take into consideration the new regulatory environment we are in, the rules, the regulations, whether it\u2019s CCAR or not in terms of how we think about operating the company, but in terms of how we fundamentally manage credit it really hasn\u2019t impacted how we fundamentally manage credit, which is in a very disciplined way. But overall, there\u2019s no question it has. John Shrewsberry : I would -- I would be specific, because the leverage lending guidance has changed the behavior of large banks. And frankly, it\u2019s that\u2019s, that\u2019s good for us. It\u2019s brought the industry closer to where we were already operating in. And on the consumer side, if you give credence to the notion that putting low quality mortgages on the books of banks was approximate cause of their of their demise, or at least their credit woes, we\u2019ve seen plenty of examples of that. Those loans don\u2019t exist any longer. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s more Dodd-Frank I would say than it is CCAR. But there\u2019s a complex web of incremental regulation has really strengthened the balance sheets of banks asset quality is better, capital levels are better. Liquidity is better, and the system benefits I think from that without a doubt. Gerard Cassidy : And John, to follow up on what you pointed out on the leverage loan side on the regulatory front, what are you guys looking at for indirect or unintended consequences of these loans being outside the banking system but how they may revert back and impact some of your customers? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So there\u2019s sort of two, at least two ways. One is, we are a participant in and financing some non banks. This has been a topic of conversation on our calls before, and so thinking about that we did it before. The last crisis, and we\u2019ve done it since, and we\u2019re very cautious about how we how we select customers, how we underwrite the credit that they\u2019re extending and the magnitude of the haircut that we require to protect our own advances. So we were very familiar with what\u2019s going on. We\u2019re also an investor, a CLO triple investor and we\u2019re before the last crisis and have been today. And we think with the way loans are being originated, the way those deals are structured, and our understanding and stressing of them that that\u2019s good, that\u2019s good risk return for Wells Fargo. With respect to the impact that it has on customers, we don\u2019t have as customers a lot of middle market LBO candidates. We do have sponsors as customers and other asset managers, and as it relates to our core, the core wholesale middle market customer they tend not to be a borrower of those other, those other entities. And so I think that our, as Tim said, our willingness to stand ready to lend directly to people with whom we have a relationship that we understand, when to use other sources of liquidity, go away be something that we\u2019re probably taking advantage of in the event that we hit the end of the cycle. This was certainly true 10 years ago, and it might look similar this time. Gerard Cassidy : And then just lastly, you mentioned the Pick-a-Pay portfolio, I think is about $4.9 billion. You\u2019ve had success, obviously, in selling that off and reporting gains. Should we expect over 2019 the remainder of that portfolio will be sold? Or is that something you plan to hold onto? John Shrewsberry : There\u2019s some piece of it is probably unsalable. But if market conditions persist, it\u2019s my -- my sense is that will probably continue to do a little bit more. It\u2019s opportunistic, it\u2019s discretionary, it doesn\u2019t have to happen, but those are loans with loan structures and even borrowers who are a click riskier than the loans that we\u2019re making today in the ordinary course. And when this cycle does end, those are the loans that are probably going to have a higher default rate, and to the extent that we can find the right, the right buyer for those at prices that makes sense that will de-risk us from an operational risk perspective when that time comes, because there will be more will be more defaults. Gerard Cassidy : Great, as always, appreciate the color. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. John Shrewsberry : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey, good morning guys. If I could just ask you quickly just on the commercial lending front again. I heard the points about the markets and the big corporate loans and that\u2019s showing up in everybody\u2019s results so far. But can you guys just take us kind of through some of the commercial segments, and just give us that sense of are you seeing the underlying business expansion move through middle markets, small business, just what\u2019s like the color you\u2019re getting from the field as you kind of look to that underlying outside of these kind of big credits that have been clearly showing up at the industry level? Tim Sloan : I think the short answer is yes, but it's to your point, it really is a function of which business that you're referring to. So for example the bread and butter middle market and a commercial banking business that we\u2019re a leader in, we saw some nice growth in the quarter which we highlighted the small business loan growth year-over-year, it was in the mid-teens\u2026 Ken Usdin : Origination? Tim Sloan : Originations, I\u2019m sorry. Good point. Originations. I think -- now to some extent that\u2019s a bit idiosyncratic to us just because we\u2019re seeing an improvement in referrals from the branches based upon all the work that we\u2019ve done with the team there. But again that\u2019s, I think that\u2019s indicative that was pretty strong. Having said that, as John pointed out, we saw some seasonality in our equipment finance business. We saw some seasonality in the businesses where we finance dealers or retailers in the growth in the expectation of what\u2019s going to happen over the holidays and alike. But, but I would say overall, we\u2019re seeing steady growth in the areas that you\u2019re referring to. Ken Usdin : And in that context of the back to banks a little bit. Can you just also just comment what you\u2019re seeing then on the pricing side? Have there been any changes to the ability to get a little price back in that regard or is it just still tough out there with all the competition and still pretty good liquidity? Tim Sloan : It\u2019s still competitive out there. I mean there\u2019s no question about that. I think that it\u2019s most competitive when you have a transaction size in which you have not only a large bank competing, you have a medium sized -- bank competing and you have a small bank and then throw in a non-bank just for docs and all of a sudden it can be pretty competitive. I think in particular it\u2019s very competitive where any of us are trying to work to maintain a long term relationship. So I wouldn\u2019t say that the dislocation that occurred in the fourth quarter while it increased volume a bid for our large corporate customers it didn\u2019t necessarily have a big impact on pricing. Ken Usdin : Understood. And last quick one, just -- as your trajectories for the turn in auto is that generally still intact as well? Tim Sloan : Yes generally and specifically. Ken Usdin : Okay. Very good. Thanks Tim. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Hey Kevin. John Shrewsberry : Good morning. Kevin Barker : Good morning. Just quick question on the equity gains and losses. I mean obviously we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of dislocation in the high yield market, and the last time that occurred maybe not on the scale that we saw back then, but in 2016 the private equity gains and the equity gains in general were relatively low compared to previous years. Is your expectation that we may see a lull there if the market volatility continues in high yield market? John Shrewsberry : Not so much. I mean what we\u2019re seeing from portfolios of NEP and NVP is still that it is a better time to be a seller than an investor notwithstanding. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s that many and certainly not on NVP and not even that many deals on any NEP side where things are getting sold to people who require high yield financing in order to make it work know like another sponsor for example it\u2019s more often that they're selling something to a strategic who\u2019s got their other sources of financing. So I think that the -- if we continue in this elevated level of asset prices generally with scarcity of interesting assets and then you know not to over promise. But I -- my sense is that we'll still be a realizer of gains throughout the course of 2019. Kevin Barker : Okay and then just a follow up on some of your mortgage comments. You mentioned that you start to see maybe a little bit better comps or a little bit improvement in the overall mortgage market as capacity adjust. Are you seeing signs that capacity is starting to adjust and then you\u2019re going to continue to see that improved throughout the year? Tim Sloan : Yes. And so importantly my comments were hopeful not real not being realized. We would expect if capacity comes out of the system because smaller players are less efficient players are not making any money then there would be a I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a return to what gains used to be that people in the industry that seem to believe that thinks you know snap back to some equilibrium level over and over again but this could be different. We haven\u2019t seen actual capacity come out we\u2019ve heard lots of stories about people who are closer to capitulating, but it hasn't seemed to happen. And so we\u2019re as we said we\u2019re focusing on the customer experience focusing on taking cost out and trying to figure out how to make an attractive return in the environment that we\u2019re in. And then to the extent that the future unfolds the way I just described and that would be a upsized, but we\u2019re not there yet. Kevin Barker : Okay, thanks for taking my question. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Tim Sloan : Good morning. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So I was hoping to dig into some of the fee income trends that we saw in the quarter, and certainly an area where there\u2019s been a lot of investor attention, but if adjust for various special items in the quarter, it looks like we\u2019re starting with a jumping off point of about $8.5 billion or $34 billion annual license fee income. I recognize it was a very tough quarter in terms of some of the market sensitive businesses and you spoke of some of the growth areas within 2019, whether it be mortgage release income, but because you have some of those headwinds in the wealth side as well that you noted you told me you can maybe frame, what\u2019s the right jumping off point for the fee income to start the year? And what you believe is an achievable growth target for the remainder of 2019? John Shrewsberry : Well that\u2019s an excellent question, but the jump -- the stepping off point is the some of the stories in each of the lines and we really don\u2019t sort of wrap that up and put a single growth rate on it because there\u2019s so many things that are driven by different forces, whether it\u2019s, as you said the S&P in the case of certain fee income lines, what\u2019s going on, in the mortgage market, what are competitive positioning is? What the growth rate of customer growth is? Account growth is? All of those things matter. For some of the reasons we describe the valuation adjustment to the MSR and then the deferred comp hedging program I guess, I would say that those are unlikely to recur in that way as we roll forward. And then I would adjust as for what\u2019s happened in the S&P just as a proxy for the line items that are keyed on that not some of those have repriced right through the fourth quarter and some as I mentioned reprice after the fourth quarter and so the impact of what happened in the fourth quarter will be felt until the first quarter there. And then its reasonable people will take different approaches to the trending of other things that just represents sort of the ongoing everyday accumulation of millions and millions of transactions etcetera or interactions with customers. And I think we\u2019ll arrive at a slightly different starting off point. Definitely committed to working on each individual line and the drivers of it to be as growth oriented and frankly even expense oriented as we can and contributing to it, but there is no elegant way to just put a number. Steven Chubak : Right. Fair enough. I appreciate all the color, John and maybe just one follow up for me on through the cycle loss guidance and expectations have to credit you guys for being one of the few banks to actually give any sort of guidance on through the cycle loss rate expectations and mainly, you\u2019ve also cleansed the balance sheet, you\u2019ve also significantly derisk selling down some Pick-a-Pay loans and other higher risk loans. I was hoping you can maybe update us on whether that 60 to 70 basis points are still the appropriate through the cycle level you\u2019re thinking about. And a question I\u2019ve had quite often is what are some of the underlying assumptions across the different loan buckets as you think about framing that 60 to 70? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So it\u2019s -- it is the number that we have out there from our last Investor Day and we\u2019d probably update it again at our next Investor Day. So in the meantime, I think that\u2019s good guidance. As we\u2019ve described in a couple of areas, at the margin that many of the things that we\u2019ve done in the last year have increased the average credit quality not that averages account for everything but have increased credit quality on the balance sheet, both in commercial and in consumer. We\u2019ve been operating in this 25 to 30 basis point range now for a while in terms of losses some of that is influenced by the fact that we have line items that have been in net recovery and so they don\u2019t really reflect what's going on with the loans \u2013 today\u2019s loans that are getting charged off. So if you zeroed out net recovery, you probably end up a few basis points higher than the recent run rate. So I would stick with the guidance that we gave. Unfortunately also, we never actually through the cycle, right. We\u2019re either better than the average or we\u2019re worse than the average and we\u2019re either building maybe especially under seasonal building, building, building. And so our results will reflect that even if the charge offs are measured a little bit differently. But I do think the next time that we update that guidance based on what that mix is in our portfolio and what the risk rating is in each of the categories, my sense is we\u2019re its safer overall portfolio than it was the last time we measured it and it\u2019s not unlikely that we\u2019d reflect that in the average, which we haven\u2019t updated it since last Investor Day. Tim Sloan : Well, a big driver of those results is it going to be \u2013 what\u2019s the cause of the downturn, right. And how deep a downturn we might experience. So some of it\u2019s a little bit beyond our control, but I sure would agree with John when you look at the quality of our loan portfolio today versus where we are five years ago and 10 years ago, it's markedly better. Steven Chubak : Thank you very much. It\u2019s a very helpful color. Operator : Your next question will come from the line up of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Vivek. Tim Sloan : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi, John. Hi, Tim. Couple of questions. One is, John you referred to the level of over collateralization or haircuts a couple of times, can you -- on those loans to non-bank financial or whatever in that category of loans that you talked about that you\u2019ve given detail previously. Can you give us some sense of what is that -- what is that percentage, is that 15%, is that 20% haircut, well, what kind on average? John Shrewsberry : It\u2019s a good question. So there\u2019s a variety of different underlying loans in those books of business, there\u2019s consumer, there\u2019s commercial, there\u2019s secured, there\u2019s unsecured, and each of them are structured to reflect what we think the lost content is of the underlying portfolio. So I want to \u2013 I\u2019m estimating though, I haven\u2019t looked that at all, but on average it would be call it 30% to 40% in terms of a haircut, and on average the credit quality of that portfolio would correspond to a to a single A or single A minus, our exposure. So it\u2019s -- the loans there on their probability of default and loss given default terms are substantially higher credit quality than the average loan on our books overall. They do tend to be a little bit bigger and does a little bit more concentrated there, they\u2019re actively managed because there are loans going in and loans coming out etcetera, but as a result we\u2019ve taken these extra precautions. And that\u2019s how they would pencil out from an agency equivalency point of view. Tim Sloan : And Vivek, the other point I would make on that portfolio are a couple of other points. One, the under -- that their the exposure that we have is in industries that we\u2019re comfortable with. So we\u2019ve got experience, that\u2019s number one. Number two to emphasize John\u2019s point, we\u2019ve got approval rights going in to the facilities and then kick out rights in many of the facilities on the way out if there\u2019s an underlying loan that we\u2019re concerned about. So, we look very comfortable with the underlying risk in that portfolio. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Good. Thanks. A different question completely. The ROTCE target of 17% you\u2019ll have given any color on that, can you give us an update especially given where revenues have gone, given level of rates and yield curve and etcetera, etcetera. How are you thinking about that? John Shrewsberry : Well, we\u2019re still working toward 15 and 17, I\u2019m more of an ROE guy than a ROTCE guy, but they work together. The combination of the range of revenue expectations that we have the specific expense guidance that we\u2019ve given, and the capital plan, last year\u2019s capital plan that we\u2019ve enacted and our expectation for the next capital plan etcetera, and where we where we might be, we\u2019ve had to put an estimate in that process for where we\u2019d be in credit at the time because I think we estimated it would be somewhat more normal than the better than normal environment we\u2019ve been in for the last couple of years, all work together to drive to that outcome and we\u2019re continuing to drive to that outcome. Vivek Juneja : And just remind me that 15 and 17 when you originally put it out, you\u2019re assuming flattish revenues, was that -- am I right? Tim Sloan : Yes. It worked with less than flat revenue but the point that we made in that presentation was don\u2019t assume any revenue growth, we don\u2019t require you to assume any revenue growth because we would have just turned to focusing on that. So it works with revenue at a lower level than 2017 revenue which was the -- what was on the slide for the basis of that discussion. Vivek Juneja : Okay. All right. Thank you. Tim Sloan : Thank you. Operator : I will now turn the conference back over to management for any further remarks. Tim Sloan : Great. Hey, I want to thank all of you for spending time with us today. And I also want to thank our team members as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, there\u2019s been a tremendous amount of hard work and effort to achieve not only the financial results, but from a long term standpoint the fundamental transformation that\u2019s going on at the company. So I want to thank them and also want to thank you for your time and your interest in the company. Have a great rest of the day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Katherine. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplements are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today, containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Allen Parker. Allen Parker : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for today's discussion of our first quarter results. As you know, this is my first time participating in the quarterly earnings call. I'm pleased to be with you and I look forward to your questions and today's dialogue. This morning, I'll outline the actions I'm taking together with our leadership team to continue to transform Wells Fargo and to get that transformation right for all our stakeholders, including our customers, our team members, our shareholders and our regulators. Since assuming my new role, I've been focused on leading our Company forward by emphasizing my top priorities, serving our customers and supporting our Wells Fargo team members, meeting and exceeding the expectations of our regulators and continuing the important transformation of the Company. Today, we're honored to serve one out of every three U.S. households, but we know that some of our past practices harmed our customers. The team and I are committed to addressing these mistakes of the past, and over the coming weeks and months I plan to spend much of my time listening to our customers and working to understand how we can best serve them. Our goal with respect to our customers is to develop even deeper relationships that are built on trust, accessibility and outstanding service. As part of reaching that goal, we will continue, wherever appropriate, to contact customers we have let down and compensate them for any harm. To this end, over a year ago, we created a customer remediation center of excellence, so that we could provide more consistent, timely and effective remediation to our customers. This team, which sits outside our lines of business, establishes our Companywide remediation policies, sets standards and coordinates with our lines of business in the day-to-day management of remediation efforts and provides our Board of Directors, our regulators and our senior management with comprehensive information about all customer remediation efforts that we are taking place at Wells Fargo. And as you're aware, we have been providing updates on our remediation progress in our quarterly filings. We've also been dedicated to providing customer focused innovation. A few examples include overdraft rewind, real-time balance alerts, control tower and our online mortgage application. We remain focused on innovating for our customers, and these efforts will continue to be a top transformation priority. The changes we\u2019re making to better serve customers are possible only because of the hard work of our over 260,000 talented and dedicated team members. Since assuming my new role, I've had the opportunity to meet with and hear from many of my Wells Fargo colleagues around the country and across our businesses. And I'm impressed every day by their commitment and their enthusiasm regarding the opportunities ahead. We continue to strengthen Wells Fargo's leadership team with both internal promotions and external hires, including our Head of Technology, Saul Van Beurden who joined Wells Fargo earlier this week as a member of our operating committee. Our new Chief Auditor, Julie Scammahorn joins us later this month as a member of the operating committee. And we've also strengthened our senior most enterprise risk and control committee, which is co-chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, Mandy Norton and me, and includes the heads of every business and enterprise function. In addition to hiring Mandy last year, we\u2019ve strengthened our risk leadership team with both internal and external talent, and we continue to be successful in hiring externally for key roles during the first quarter. Our corporate risk management team grew by approximately 1,300 team members last year and we currently expect to add another 1,300 team members this year with the overwhelming majority of these new hires dedicated to strengthening our compliance and operational risk management efforts. In addition to these ongoing leadership changes, we're also realigning our business structure and making significant investments in key capabilities that taken together will help ensure that we meet the expectations of our regulators. Let me give you just a few examples. First, we\u2019ve discarded our old decentralized corporate structure and centralized our enterprise control functions. As we have already seen, this important change will enhance our visibility to all aspects of our business and improve the consistency and sustainability of our results. Second, we're transforming our approach to risk management, and we will dedicate all necessary resources to getting these risk management enhancements right. Wells Fargo has always excelled at management of credit and market risk, and our goal is to bring our operational risk and compliance capabilities to that same level of excellence. Third, we're emphasizing operational excellence throughout the Company. And as part of that process, we've named a dedicated leader who is responsible for driving companywide business process management. We are building dedicated teams across each business group and enterprise function, and those teams will enable us to better deliver consistent, desired outcomes for our customers and manage our operations more efficiently and effectively, all while strengthening operational risk management. Finally, we are transforming our technology platform with the goal of enhancing the customer experience by becoming more centralized, consistent and efficient, and how we deliver technology products and solutions. While we're aggressively addressing our risk and control issues and building a better bank, I want to acknowledge clearly that we have a substantial amount of work yet to do, both to satisfy the expectations of our regulators and even more important, to create the financial institution we aspire to be. Recent public statements on the part of our regulators have indicated their disappointment with our progress to date. We understand and appreciate their criticism, and we are now redoubling our efforts to satisfy their expectations of us, and our expectations of ourselves. We are focused on not only satisfying but also exceeding the expectation of all our regulators. I take this responsibility very seriously. And the operating committee and I have made clear that the entire Wells Fargo team must act assertively and decisively to meet our regulators\u2019 expectations as we go forward. Specifically, we agree with Chairman Powell's recent public comments that we have more work to do under the February 2018 Federal Reserve consent order. That necessary work is at varying stages of progress, and much of the work consists of completing and implementing efforts that are substantially underway. But regardless of the status of the progress of any particular part of the necessary work, I want to make clear that the most important thing for our Company is that and our ongoing constructive engagement with the Federal Reserve. We focus on getting that work done in a first rate and sustainable way and not focus on duly on when we believe that process will be completed. Accordingly, we do not feel it's appropriate to provide guidance as to the timing of the lifting of the asset cap. We understand the seriousness of getting our work with the Federal Reserve right, and we are therefore making and will be willing to make the investments that are necessary to complete the work that's needed to improve our compliance and operational risk capabilities. This work is fundamentally an evolution of our business model, and this evolution will both change how we manage compliance and operational risk, and by simplifying and strengthening our business processes help us serve our customers better and become more efficient, all of which will benefit our shareholders over the long term. As you know, we\u2019re currently operating well below the asset cap, and we have had and will continue to have the ability to serve the needs of all our 700 million customers -- excuse me, 70 million customers, while we work to satisfy the requirements of the Federal Reserve consent order. While we've been working to fulfill the commitments to our regulators, we've also continued to deliver strong financial performance, as our first quarter results demonstrate. We remained focused on reducing expenses, even as we make significant and necessary investments to meet our regulators\u2019 expectations and to help ensure that we deliver best-in-class services to our customers. We remain committed to our 2019 expense target. We continue to pursue business simplification, so we can focus our efforts on businesses where we believe we have leadership position that's required to excel long term. This week's announced sale of our institutional retirement and trust business advances that goal. We also remain committed to returning our excess capital to our shareholders. And this quarter, we returned $6 billion to our shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases. I've met with the leaders of all our businesses over the past few weeks. And as we go forward, I will continue to work closely with them as part of the focus and my top priorities for the Company. Bringing this all together, I'm firmly committed to doing what's right for our stakeholders. While there's a lot of work that still needs to be done, I believe the actions I've outlined this morning are the right steps to be taken by and for our Company at this time. The work we're doing in conjunction with our regulators to improve operational effectiveness will make Wells Fargo a more simple and nimble company while at the same time bringing us closer to our customers, which is the real reason we're here. This in turn fits well with our objective of becoming more efficient. I take very seriously my responsibility as a steward of our shareholders\u2019 capital, and I'm confident that these actions will create day by day a better company that will drive shareholder value over the long-term. Simply put, we are engaged in a transformative effort with the goal of building the most customer-focused, efficient and innovative Wells Fargo ever, a premier financial institution characterized by a strong financial foundation, a leading presence in our chosen markets, focused growth within a responsible risk management framework, operational excellence and highly engaged team members. I have no doubt that we will achieve that goal. I'm confident and optimistic about the opportunities ahead to build something extraordinary, and I look forward to communicating with you regularly on our progress. John Shrewsberry will now discuss our financial results in more detail. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Allen, and good morning, everyone. We share some of the highlights of our first quarter results on page two, including earning $5.9 billion or a $1.20 per diluted common share, and an ROE of 12.71% and an ROTCE of 15.16%. As Allen mentioned, we returned $6 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, up from $4 billion a year ago, and we increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.45 per share. We also had positive business momentum in many areas, including both customer loyalty and overall satisfaction with most recent visit branch survey scores reaching their highest levels in three years in March. Period-end loans grew from a year ago with C&I loans increasing 4% and credit card loans up 6%. Primary consumer checking customers increased 1.1% from a year ago. The sale of 52 branches that closed in the fourth quarter reduced this growth rate by 0.5 percentage point. Card usage increased with debit card purchase volume up 6% and consumer general purpose credit card purchase volume up 5% from a year ago. And high-quality nonconforming mortgage loan originations increased 35%, auto originations increased 24% and small business originations increased 6% compared with the year ago. On page three, we highlight noteworthy items in the first quarter. Our earnings of $5.9 billion included $778 million of seasonally higher personnel expense. And while it didn\u2019t affect our earnings, deferred compensation, which is impacted by equity market pricing, which of course recovered in the first quarter, increased fee income by $345 million and increased expenses by $357 million in the first quarter. As you may recall, deferred comp results in the fourth quarter reduced fee income by $452 million, and reduced expenses by $429 million. So, the linked quarter change was over $780 million as equity markets recovered. We added a table to our appendix to help you better track how deferred comp can cause volatility and our revenue and expenses, even though it's P&L neutral. We also had a $608 million gain on the sale of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans. We had a $150 million reserve build, primarily due to a higher probability of less favorable economic conditions. We had a $148 million gain from the sale of our business payroll services and our effective income tax rate was 13.1%, which included $297 million of net discrete income tax benefit in the quarter. We highlight year-over-year results on page four. Compared with the first quarter of \u201818, revenue declined 1%, primarily driven by lower trust and investment fees, and mortgage banking fees, partially offset by 1% growth in net interest income. The decline in expenses was driven by lower operating losses, as well as a decline in a number of other expense categories which I\u2019ll highlight later on the call. While our net charge-off rate improved from a year-ago, our provision expense increased due to a $150 million reserve build in the first quarter of 2019, compared with $550 million reserve release a year-ago. And our capital levels remain strong, while we reduced common shares outstanding by 7%. I'll be highlighting the balance sheet drivers on page five throughout the call. So, let me just mention here that we adopted the new lease accounting standard in the first quarter, which had no meaningful impact on our P&L, but requires operating leases to be recognized now on the balance sheet as the right of use asset, increasing our other assets by $4.9 billion. Page six, revenue grew 3% from the fourth quarter as lower net interest income was more than offset by growth in non-interest income, and I'll highlight the fee income drivers later on the call. As I mentioned earlier, our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 13.1%, and we currently expect the effective income tax rate for the remainder of 2019 to be approximately 18%, excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items. Average loans increased $3.8 billion from the fourth quarter, the second consecutive linked quarter increase with growth in the commercial portfolio, partially offset by continued declines in the consumer portfolio. Period-end loans increased $941 million from a year-ago, with growth in high-quality non-conforming first mortgage loans, C&I loans and credit card loans, largely offset by $6.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage and reliable consumer auto loan sales since the second quarter of 2018. I'll highlight the driver of the linked quarter decline in period-end loans starting on page eight. Commercial loans declined $1.2 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by C&I loans. Recall that we had strong C&I loan growth in the fourth quarter, which included the benefits from the capital markets disruption, and as expected some of those loans paid down when capital markets rebounded. This market improvement drove a $4 billion decline in asset backed finance. At the same time, we had strong growth in commercial capital, reflecting seasonal strength in commercial distribution finance as well as capital finance; that growth driven by customers origination activity and working capital needs. Our credit investment portfolio also increased as we purchased CLOs in loan form rather than in debt securities, which doesn't change the risk profile of the asset. Commercial real estate loans increased $460 million from the fourth quarter, the first linked quarter increase since the first quarter of 2017. Our growth in the first quarter reflected our continued credit discipline and high-quality loan originations as well as less runoff of previously purchased loan portfolios. As we show on page nine, consumer loans declined $3.7 billion from the fourth quarter. The first mortgage portfolio declined $520 million from the fourth quarter, driven by the sale of $1.6 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans. We had $3.1 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI mortgage loans remaining at quarter-end. Partially offsetting this decline was $4.2 billion of high-quality nonconforming loan growth, which excludes another $776 million that were designated as held for sale in anticipation of future securitizations. Junior lien mortgage loans were down $1.3 billion from the fourth quarter as originations were more than offset by pay-downs, primarily from loans originated prior to 2009. Credit card loans declined $746 million from the fourth quarter, driven by expected seasonality. Auto loan balances were down $156 million from the fourth quarter; this was the smallest linked quarter decline since the portfolio started to shrink in the fourth quarter of 2016. We had $5.4 billion of auto originations in the first quarter, the highest since the first quarter of 2017. We increased our auto origination market share with high-quality originations, and we currently expect our auto loan -- our auto portfolio balances to grow by midyear and as early as the second quarter. Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $961 million from the fourth quarter on lower margin loans and other securities based lending, reflecting higher short-term rates as well as market volatility. Personal loans and lines and student loans also declined. Turning to deposits on page 10. Average deposits declined $35.1 billion from a year ago, reflecting both lower wholesale banking deposits including actions taken in the first half of last year to manage to the asset cap, and lower wealth and investment management deposits as customers allocated more cash to higher-yielding liquid alternatives. Average deposits declined $6.8 billion from the fourth quarter as lower wholesale banking deposits, driven by seasonality, were partially offset by higher consumer and small business banking deposits. On average, deposit costs increased 10 basis points from the fourth quarter and 31 basis points from a year-ago, driven primarily by increases in wholesale and WIM deposit rates. On page 11, we've updated the deposit beta slide we included last quarter. The cumulative one-year beta has increased to 43%, up from 38% last quarter, reflecting continued pricing competition across major deposit categories. The cumulative beta since the start of the cycle was 35% as of the end of the first quarter. Recall, we provided at our investor day an estimate of through-the-cycle beta of 45% to 55% for our mix of deposits. Our ultimate through-the-cycle beta will depend on a number of factors including industry asset growth trends, which will in turn influence the supply and demand dynamics for deposits. On page 12, we provide details on period-end deposits, which decreased $22.2 billion from the fourth quarter. Wholesale banking deposits were down $37 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting seasonality from typically higher fourth quarter levels. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $9.4 billion from higher retail banking deposits reflecting seasonality, as well as growth in CDs and high-yield savings. Wealth and investment management deposits decreased partly by our client shifting cash back into investments during the quarter. As you may recall in the fourth quarter, the market volatility resulted in our client shifting into cash. In addition, our WIM customers continued reallocating cash in the higher higher-yielding liquid alternatives. Net interest income decreased $333 million from the fourth quarter, primarily driven by two fewer days in the quarter, which reduced net interest income by approximately a $160 million, the balance sheet mix and repricing and including the impact of a flattening yield curve. Earlier this year, we said, we expect net interest income growth for the full-year 2019 to be in the range of minus 2% to plus 2%. Several factors have driven shifts in our view, including a lower absolute rate outlook, a flatter curve, tightening loan spreads resulting from a competitive market with ample liquidity and continued upward pressure on deposit pricing. We now expect NII will decline 2% to 5% this year compared with 2018. Noninterest income increased $962 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher market sensitive revenue and mortgage banking fees. The $1.3 billion increase in market sensitive revenue was driven by higher gains from equity securities, which included $797 million of higher deferred comp gains. Net gains from trading activities rebounded from a weaker fourth quarter, increasing $347 million, driven primarily by strength in credit and asset-backed products. Mortgage banking revenue increased $241 million from the fourth quarter from higher servicing income due to negative valuation adjustments to MSRs in the fourth quarter. Mortgage originations decline $5 billion from the fourth quarter, primarily due to expected seasonality, while the production margin increased to 105 basis points, primarily due to improvement in secondary market conditions. We currently expect the production margin in the second quarter to remain in a similar range to what we've had for the past two quarters. Applications in the first quarter increased $16 billion from the fourth quarter from stronger purchase and refi activity. And we ended the quarter with a $32 billion unclosed pipeline, the highest pipeline since the second quarter of 2017, and up 78% from the fourth quarter. As you would assume with the recent decline in mortgage interest rates, a significantly higher percentage of our customers could benefit from a refinance. We expect to see higher origination volume in the second quarter due to typical seasonality for home buying as well as some additional refinance activity resulting from the recent decrease and mortgage interest rates. Trust and investment fees declined $147 million from the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower asset-based fees on retail brokerage advisory assets, reflecting lower market valuations on December 31st, which is when these assets were priced for first quarter revenue purposes. Turning to expenses on page 15. Expenses increased 4% from the fourth quarter and declined 7% from a year ago. Let me explain the drivers starting on page 16. Expenses increased $577 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher compensation and benefits expense. This increase included $785 million of higher deferred comp expense, which is offset in revenue and $778 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses, in line with the seasonal increase last year. These seasonally higher personnel expenses should decline in the second quarter, but salary expense is expected to grow, reflecting increases which became effective late in the first quarter as well as an additional payroll day in the second quarter. Revenue-related expenses declined $241 million from lower commission and incentive comp expense mainly in WIM and community banking, as well as lower operating lease expense. Third-party services declined $219 million from lower outside professional services and contract services expense. Running the business nondiscretionary expense declined $580 million, primarily from lower core deposit and other intangibles as the 10-year amortization period on the Wachovia-related intangibles ended, and also from lower operating losses. Finally, running the business discretionary expense declined on lower travel and entertainment expense, and lower advertising and promotion expense, which were typically higher in the fourth quarter. As we show on page 17, expenses were down $1.1 billion from a year ago, driven by $1.2 billion of lower operating losses. Expenses also declined from lower core deposit and other intangibles and lower FDIC expense. These declines were partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense, primarily driven by $353 million of higher deferred comp expense. We're committed to and on track to meet our 2019 expense target of $52 billion to $53 billion, which excludes annual operating losses in excess of $600 million such as litigation and remediation accruals and penalties. As I highlighted on our call a couple of weeks ago, our strategic and financial targets beyond 2019 will be established once we have a permanent CEO in place. That being said, we're just as committed to our cost saving initiatives. And as you'll see, we found even more opportunity than previously anticipated. However, we also have the need to spend more in areas Allen described in his remarks. While our 2019 expense target hasn't changed, as we show on page 19, the investments we're making in our business have increased from the expectations we had at our 2018 investor day. In May of 2018, we expected our high-priority enterprise investment spend to increase for full year 2018 and to decline starting in 2019. However, nothing is more important than meeting our regulatory obligations; and we've increased spending to improve operational and compliance risk management as well as for other high-priority projects. As a result, our actual and anticipated investment spend for 2018 through 2019 has increased by $1.4 billion from our expectations at our 2018 investor day. As we show on page 20, while our expected investments in 2019 have increased, our expected savings are also exceeding our original expectations, which is why our 2019 expense target hasn't changed. We're tracking over 200 specific initiatives on a monthly basis, which drives accountability. The major categories of savings are from centralization and optimization, including staff function rationalization and advancing our contact center of the future, running the business, which includes streamlining our mortgage operations and restructuring our wholesale banking business as examples and governance and controls overspending, which is expected to further reduce third-party services spend and includes a consistent approach to manage our spans of control and hiring location guidelines for noncustomer facing team members. Turning to our business segments, starting on page 21. Community banking earnings decreased $346 million from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally higher personnel expense. On page 22, we provide updated community banking metrics. We had 29.8 million digital active customers in the first quarter, up 3% from a year-ago, including 7% growth in mobile active customers, and in the first quarter, our mobile banking top box customer satisfaction score was at an all time high. Primary consumer checking customers have grown year-over-year for six consecutive quarters. Digital continued to generate strong checking account growth with new checking customers acquired through the digital channel up more than 50% from a year-ago. And I already highlighted our strong branch survey scores, which reached three-year highs in March. On page 23, we highlight the continued decline in teller and ATM transactions down 9% from year-ago, reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels. We completed 40 branch consolidations in the first quarter, as we continue to evolve how we serve our customers based on their preferences. For the first time, we are providing the number of consumer and small business digital payment transactions, which increased 6% from a year-ago, reflecting continued increases in usage and digital adoption. Turning to page 24, wholesale banking earnings increased $99 million from the fourth quarter, driven by higher market sensitive revenue and lower non-interest expense. Wealth and investment management earnings declined $112 million from the fourth quarter, driven by lower asset-based fees, reflecting the lower 12/31 market valuations, which was when retail brokerage advisory assets were priced. In the second quarter, these asset-based fees will reflect the higher March 31st market valuations. WIM earnings also reflected seasonally higher personnel expense. As Allen highlighted, earlier this week, we announced an agreement to sell our institutional retirement and trust business, which reflects our strategy by focusing our resources on areas where we believe we can grow and maximize our opportunities within wealth brokerage and asset management. The financial details related to this transaction, as well as the associated gain will be disclosed after the transaction closes, which is expected to occur in the third quarter. Turning to page 26. We continued to have strong credit results with a net charge-off rate of 30 basis points in the first quarter and net charge-offs down $26 million from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonally lower auto and other revolving credit and installment loan losses. Non-accrual loans increased $409 million from the fourth quarter, as a decline in consumer non-accruals was more than offset by a $609 million increase in commercial non-accrual loans, driven in part by a borrower in the utility sector, as well as increases in oil and gas. As I highlighted earlier, we had a $150 million reserve build. And while this was our first reserve build since the second quarter of 2016, it's important to remember that our net charge-offs remained at historically low levels. We've been asked a lot about the impact of CECL. So, let me give you our current expectation. Using our loan portfolio composition at March 31, we estimate that the impact of the adoption of CECL will be in the range of zero to $1 billion reduction in reserves, which reflects the expected decrease for commercial loans, given their short contractual maturities and the current economic environment, partially offset by an expected increase for longer duration consumer loans. As a reminder, we have a smaller credit card portfolio than our large bank peers, which reduces the impact of CECL adoption -- the impact that will have on our consumer loans. In addition, our reserves may be further reduced by as much as $1.5 billion of recoveries related to pending FASB guidance to consider increases in collateral value on previously written down residential mortgage loans. These loans were written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle. Under current rules, increases in collateral value are only recognized when selected. The ultimate effect of CECL will depend on the size and composition of our loan portfolio, the portfolio's credit quality and economic conditions at the time of adoption as well as any refinements to our models, methodology, or other key assumptions. Perhaps more importantly, as the credit cycle turns, there will be more volatility in the periodic remeasurement under a lifetime loss estimation approach. Also of note, the expected reserve reduction due to the adoption of CECL will increase our capital levels. Turning to page 27. Our CET1 ratio fully phased in, increased 20 basis points from the fourth quarter as continued strong returns of capital even with seasonally higher share issuance in the first quarter were more than offset by capital generation from earnings, improved cumulative OCI and lower risk-weighted assets. Returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. We're well above the CET1 on regulatory minimum of 9% in our current internal target of 10%. We submitted our capital plan last week. And similar to prior years, we assessed our current and projected levels of excess capital as one of the many key considerations in the evaluation of future capital distributions. So, in summary, our first quarter results continue to reflect strong customer activity and some underlying positive business momentum, and we're on track to achieve our 2019 expense target. We also understand the seriousness of the work that needs to be done, not only to meet but to exceed the expectations of our regulators, which is one of our top priorities. And we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Good morning. I wonder if you could just flush out a little more your updated NII outlook, which I think you gave us a litany of things that we're all observing. Can you try to parse out for us, is there I guess one or the other that's a bigger delta to your initial expectations? And how do you also expect NII to traject throughout the year I guess would be another one to add on to that. Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. So, I would -- the things that I mentioned in terms of shape of the curve, absolute low level of rates, I'd put at the front end of the explanation. What\u2019s going on in deposit prices -- or deposit costs is something that we're observing as betas catch up or attempt to catch up to historic norms. And then, this spread compression, which reflects not just competition for loans, but also the mix of loans on our balance sheet. As we\u2019ve sold some of these higher-yielding Pick-a-Pay loans for example, those have disproportionally higher spread. And when we consider on a quarter by quarter basis whether market conditions are right, we want to do that that will have an additional impact as well. And we've talked about this before. I don't really hear this much from other banks, but this reinvestment out the curve of excess cash and prepayments or repayments of our existing AFS portfolio is something that means a lot to us. And when the curve is as flat as it is and yields are as low as they are, that becomes a big driver at the margin as well. Most people think of interest rate sensitivity more on the LIBOR and what happens to floating rate loans. But for us, that reinvestment out the curve is a big piece too. So, all of those things relative to a quarter ago feel a little bit softer. And that's the combination. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then, I\u2019ll just repeat my second part, which was from here, so can you just talk about the NIM versus the NII and just how you expect that to traject from here, given obviously that is now challenge on a year-over-year basis? John Shrewsberry : Well, I think all of those things will play out relatively ratably. I'd say that what happens to deposit pricing is probably a little bit more. As I said before, we've tended to outperform historic expectations. And if deposit prices continue to lag and catch up to the historic beta, maybe things are a little bit stronger until later in the year, if that that catch-up takes until later in the year. That's one area where I can imagine a little bit of it not being ratable. Ken Usdin : Is that a mix thing for you guys on what within deposits is still moving, retail versus wholesale? I'll stop there. Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Yes, in part, I think because a lot our recent retail deposit gathering has been higher costs than historically. As we\u2019ve tried whether it's through promotional high-yield CDs or other offers market-by-market. And so, that is a little bit higher cost than it has been previously. One other thing I'd point out just in terms of you mentioned seasonality, this day count issue quarter-by-quarter obviously will have an impact. The cost is about $150 million or $160 million in the first quarter that will be added back in the second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Allen, maybe I could ask you to give us a sense of the type of person that Wells Fargo is looking for as a permanent CEO. And I know that maybe you just got started on that. But, it would be helpful to understand in the context of a couple of questions. One is, how do you think about the priority of having either a female, a person of color, minority taking the lead? And then, the other question has to do with track record of this individual managing either a bank or a financial, somebody with the balance sheet. I would like to understand how the organization is thinking through those two things in the context of the question. Allen Parker : Betsy, thanks very much. As you all know as well as anyone, choosing a company's leader is the most important thing a board of directors does. And I know that our Board is approaching that task with care and seriousness as they do all things. Although I'm available to the Board for any necessary consultation or any other way they need me in connection with the process, I'm not involved in the search process. So, unfortunately, I don't have any insight into the criteria that they're applying to their work or the timetable that they are thinking about in terms of completing that work. I do know that the Board's search committee has met and that they\u2019ve chosen an outside search firm to help them with their work. But, as a general matter, my understanding is that the Board's work is in its relatively early stages. And knowing the Board as well as I do, I have no doubt that they are focusing on all the questions that you've just asked. It's just not clear to me that anything in terms of their articulation of the criteria they're applying will ever be something that goes outside the Board room. The most important thing, though, I think from my perspective is for everybody to understand that while the search is underway, the Company is going to continue to move forward assertively and decisively on the priorities that John and I have discussed this morning. Betsy, I wish I could be more helpful but I just don\u2019t have any further insight. Betsy Graseck : Got it. I just would share that it strikes several investors who we\u2019ve spoken with as a little bit odd to be thinking about someone who is from outside of the banking system, given the credit risk and rate risk that financial institutions banks have that\u2019s unique to them. So, I would just share that. And then, I guess, secondly for both of you. We heard from others today about how tough it is to be running a mortgage business in the context of tough rules and regs on the mortgage industry for banks. And there is some players out there that have taken significant share that are benefiting from the regulatory arbitrage that exist for folks that are not banks that benefits their standing. So, I just wanted to understand how you're thinking about the mortgage business that you run and how you deal with that, especially on the sourcing component. Allen Parker : Betsy, I\u2019ll let John speak to the mortgage aspect of your question. I will just say by way of comment that obviously our Board Chair, Betsy Duke has a tremendous amount of experience with regard to all the issues that are associated with managing, leading a financial institution, and she is involved day to day in conversation with our investors. And I know that they are going to formulate a really precise and appropriate set of criteria in that search. John Shrewsberry : And Betsy, with respect to your point about the mortgage business, and as you described the regulatory arbitrage, I would say that we\u2019re -- mortgage lending is core to Wells Fargo, it's very important to our customers. We\u2019re an enormous originator and servicer. We've changed the business over the last couple of years to take some of the extra contractual risks out of the origination and the servicing side of things and to try and make it as tolerable as possible in the complex environment that we're operating in. But, it\u2019s not clear to me that on the servicing that the rules are very different. I do think that when you\u2019re a G-SIB and you have lots of resources that the expectations are appropriately high, we're trying to live up to that. I do think that our non-bank competition has done a good job setting the bar for us in improving the customer experience and they\u2019re tough competitors. And we\u2019re certainly up for it. But, I think non-bank competitors, both on the origination and servicing side are here to stay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. [Ph] Unidentified Analyst : John, I wanted to follow up on Ken\u2019s question around NII. Maybe give a little bit of color on what scenario is it down 5 and what kind of things happened where it\u2019s down 2? And then, just a follow-up. It doesn\u2019t sound like loan growth changed in your outlook; that wasn\u2019t the driver from what I understood there. So, are you feeling better, worse or same on kind of loan growth relative to where you were a couple of months ago? John Shrewsberry : Yes, I think we're on the loan growth front. And loan growth, given what we've been doing in running off pre-crises, noncore assets that will have an impact on our net loan growth. But, in terms of our new origination et cetera, that doesn't feel much different than it has over the last couple of months. The range of outcomes on the 2 to 5, if deposit pricing, if repricing continues to be slower than expected but it is on an upward trajectory, there\u2019s probably upside there, getting closer to 2 than 5. If the long end of the curve stays right where it is, probably -- that probably takes you into the lower end of the range. And then, loan spreads -- and loan spreads, which reflects mix as well in terms of what's going on in competition and the types of loans that we are originating, will have an impact on that as well. But we\u2019re sort of preparing you for the ideas that it could be down 5. I think if everything that I mentioned went against us, that's a reasonable outcome. But, those are the drivers. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then on CCAR, I understand you obviously can't talk details, but at a high level, as you put your capital plan together, do you factor in the regulators\u2019 disappointment in your progress or where you stand on operational excellence or is that just completely separate issues? John Shrewsberry : Well, nothing separate. The way we approach CCAR is starting with the feedback that we get in the prior year and working all year to improve our approach, which includes our operational risk identification, control identification, our scenario designed to impact those types of things, the impact more broadly on what it means both for PPNR generation. And so, I think we fully accounted for that, and we\u2019ll see in June. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And no formal change to the CET1 target yet, do you still think that kind of an upside bias on that but modest? John Shrewsberry : Yes. I think that's right. I think, we've mentioned before that it is 10% today knowing that how CECL gets integrated into CCAR -- into the severely adverse CCAR scenario, and then what the final rules are and application is to distress capital buffer. The combination of those things probably drives us up to 10.25 to 10.5 that sort of range but we -- until those things land, we are not going to set a new management target. But, those things are still out there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : So, my first question is -- it really has to do as what more you can do to deliver this Company more efficiently? We hear you loud and clear that until you have a new leader, you are not going to help us give us the sense of the expense trajectory, which is totally fair. But, as I think about the dynamics of capital return and opportunities to continue to restructure the firm, so as of year-end 2018, Wells Fargo had 2,595 more employees than JP Morgan, and your employee base declined just 3% since 2009 and you have peer banks in the United States that have 50,000 less employees than do for larger asset bases. And I'm wondering how is the Board thinking about the interplay of the fact that you have a ton of excess capital. You continue to build excess capital. Why shouldn\u2019t that be -- why shouldn\u2019t that now be an opportunity to restructure the firm in a more dramatic way than you've been telling us. I mean, in essence, with the new leadership coming in, the market is giving you sort of a pass or so to speak to really rethink a company beyond sort of taking 10% off of your headcount in three years? John Shrewsberry : Yes. Erika, that\u2019s a fair observation. I think, the work that's happening right now, which is frankly the underpinning a lot of the regulatory related requirements around operational risk and compliance is business process by business process, end to end understanding of how everything gets done at Wells Fargo in a very encyclopedic way. That\u2019s work that\u2019s underway; there's still a ton to do, but that's the gist of the underpinning of all of this work. The outcome of that will put the Allen or the new CEO in the perfect position to make determinations about how we can continue to combine like work, how we can continue to streamline our operations, what we should be doing more of and what we should be doing less of. The headcount -- I mean headcount is a great thing to point to, to compare whether we're more or less efficient. And there are opportunities for efficiency as a result of, as I said, combining like activity where we have it disparate today. There are changes in how customers are using the bank. So, we've got, we just described 9% down year-over-year in branch and ATM transactions. Our call center activity comes down as people do more on an automated basis. There\u2019s lots of secular changes that will drive headcount down. But in the short-term as we're adding in places like the control functions and the businesses, and Mandy's team broadly in the second line of defense for risk and compliance, those will definitely be -- those will push numbers up in the short term. We\u2019ve got some seasonal activity in the first quarter that happens in branches and elsewhere as there's more people on the payroll than there are later in the year. We've got cyclical businesses, like mortgage that dial up and dial down as the pipeline swells or abates. So, all of those things are working together, there is no question. We've had this discussion before that at the end of this process that for a company of our size relative to peers that you're mentioning, we have a lower risk mix of businesses. We've got our less complex, less global, et cetera mix of businesses and our expenses for total dollar of revenue for our asset base should be lower. That's definitely the goal. Erika Najarian : Got it. And Allen, if you could give us a sense, clearly, there could be an air pocket in the stock until you have a new leader in place. Is there a timeframe that the search committee is aiming for? Obviously, your shareholders want you to find the right woman or man. But, is there a timeframe that you could help us in terms of whether the search committee is looking to go more urgently? Allen Parker : Erika, I think that based on the conversations I have, the committee wants to move as urgently as they can. But, their biggest priority is making the right decision. And so, at this point, I am not really in a position to predict how long that that will be. But, I think they're going to prioritize quality decision-making over any sort of focus on speed. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just one last follow-up question, John, on the revenues. I guess, I hate to ask NII question again. But, as we think about your peers that reported this morning, they're facing similar curve dynamics but they didn't quite pull their guidance for the full year yet. And as we think about the timing of when you put out that guidance, earlier guidance on NII at the Credit Suisse conference, obviously the yield curve flattened, but is your sensitivity to the long end that material that this magnitude of change is not just significant relative to your old guide but also significant relative to peers? And what in the liability dynamics, going back to John's earlier question, are you assuming particularly on deposit repricing more specifically? John Shrewsberry : Yes. Good question. So, on the long end, I would say that we have got more conviction that we're going to be reinvesting at lower rates for more of the year than moving with through the big rally in connection with the disruption of the fourth quarter. Now, it feels like it\u2019s here to stay, sitting on the sidelines and waiting for higher yields is less of an option and so, we\u2019re beginning to redeploy here at these lower levels. So, that feels more locked in than it did during February, the Credit Suisse conference. And on the liability side, we are imagining even if we're done with moves up -- fed rate increases and moves up in the policy rates at the front end of the curve that there is some more catch-up this year to historic betas. And if that doesn't happen, as I mentioned to John, that\u2019s going to be upside or I should say, move us higher in the range of possible outcomes for this year. Erika Najarian : Sorry. Just one more question on revenues if I may, and I apologies for interrupting. On the fee side, and I don\u2019t mean to be cheeky at all but excluding the idiosyncratic gains on Pick-a-Pay end and the payroll services company, John, what would you call core fees for the year -- sorry, for the quarter? I guess, I\u2019m just trying to figure out. So, I guess the frustration in investors is, I think that you've accepted that the expanse trajectory is very hard to target, given the management change. But if the revenue base keeps splitting down, I'm afraid that some of your loyal shareholders are going to start to exit before you have a new leadership in place. And helping us figure out what the sort of what the core fees are for the quarter, and what you expect for major line items would be really helpful. John Shrewsberry : I appreciate that. So, we don\u2019t calculate something called core fees; it\u2019s non-GAAP for us to do that for ourselves. So, this is a tricky path to go down. I think mortgages are going to be stronger as we roll forward, if you're just thinking about the major line items. I think trust and investment fees will be stronger, as a result of the recovery in the market. There is a quarterly lag that\u2019s built into that. On deposit service charges, we had a couple of things happen in the first quarter that were aberrant. I think, the run rate is higher than what we posted. We had data center outage that caused us to reverse fees for people for a period of time. There was a little bit of a government shutdown that caused us to reverse some fees for others et cetera. So, those are recurring. So, as I go line item by line item, each one of them has its own story. I guess, I\u2019d point to mortgage probably as this year rolls through and given where the pipeline sits and the fact that we're up a little bit higher in terms of gain on sale, and servicing frankly feels a little bit more stable compared to Q4. We had some valuation adjustments. But, it\u2019s very likely that we'll continue to -- we always had a collection, we\u2019ve often had a collection of different types of gains from things that happen naturally in the business and from strategic decisions like selling some of these pre-crisis loans. And so, they\u2019ll be there too throughout the course of the year depending on decisions that we make. Whether they are core or noncore, it\u2019s in the eye of the beholder. But, they contribute to capital generation and earnings in the quarters when they occur. Allen Parker : Erika, if I could just circle back for a second on the search. Although the Board is going to be moving forward with appropriate urgency, they have made clear that they have complete confidence in the team that we currently have in place. And just to reemphasize, they have given us a mandate to move forward assertively. So, no one should have any doubt about that. Erika Najarian : And does that mandate -- does that mandate include perhaps pulling forward some of the opportunity that John outlined earlier as an answer to my question in terms of potentially more severe restructuring than you had earlier envisioned? Allen Parker : I think that you should understand that our current team is going to be thinking about all alternatives for the Company going forward and working very closely with the Board to think about what's best for the Company longer term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: There is a lot of focus on the fundamentals here, but I want to kind of back up to what I think is the biggest issue for the Company. You said in the prepared remarks at the very beginning, you understand what the regulators are disappointed in and maybe you could shed some light what is it that they're disappointed in and what do you either doing differently now say versus six months ago or plan to do it differently to address these things? Allen Parker : Well, let me start by saying something that's rarely said but I think it should be said, and that's the Prudential bank regulators play a really critical role in our system. They're there to ensure the safety and soundness of financial institutions like ours but they're also there to ensure the safety and security of the financial system more generally. We get their feedback constantly and we take it very seriously and we take it into account in terms of everything that we do. As you know, Matt, the recent public statements on the part of the regulators have indicated their disappointment with our progress to-date. The Fed, the OCC, the CFPB have all gone on public record in terms of saying that. We understand and accept their criticism. And as I said before, we are going to be redoubling our efforts to satisfy their expectations of us. I met with all the regulators in Washington earlier this week. And one of the things that I tried to convey to them was that we are going to try to bring to our relationship with them going forward a greater level of urgency and seriousness, understanding again that the single most important thing for us to do is to execute on our priorities and satisfy our commitments to them. And we're doing a lot of things to help us do that. We've hired a number of key leaders in new roles from outside the Company, and they've had a significant impact in terms of what we're doing. As I mentioned before, we\u2019re engaged in a thorough reshaping of our risk management framework, and that's going to fundamentally change how we manage risk within the Company. And then, finally, we're really going to be focused intently on operational excellence in all we do. And a big part of that, as I mentioned before, is our work on business process management. I would emphasize, when you take all this as a whole, the basic answer to your question is that we are going to be working harder and smarter and we're going to be focused more on execution and we're going to do all that with an appropriate sense of urgency. We believe that we can complete all the work we need to do in a timely manner. But much more important, Matt, I believe that we can do this all to the highest standards of professionalism and long-term durability for the Company. We want to not only meet their expectations but also exceed them. Matt O\u2019Connor: I guess, just a follow-up, like, I mean where is the disconnect, like, I would have thought a little over a year ago when the asset cap was implemented that that's when the communication would have been improved, that's when you have gotten to the same page. I mean, I don't know if it's just that the regulators don't appreciate how big, how granular, how diverse a company you are, so, how long it takes or if it's just been maybe bigger issues than you appreciated a year ago. I just think a lot of us don't understand when we look at Wells long term, you have a great track record from risk management perspective, again on all facets. And a lot of the people that execute on that strategy have been -- they're trying to kind of clean-up these issues. It\u2019s just so rare for a regulator to go public. So, again, I don't know if it's just that you\u2019re so big, you are so big granular that there's just so much to do and maybe they don't appreciate that, or was there something that you didn't appreciate as a company a little over a year ago? Allen Parker : Yes. I mean, it's a good follow-up. I think, one of the most important things to understand is that what we're talking about, as I said earlier is essentially an evolution of our business model. We have in essence picked out with our regulators a point on the horizon in terms of creating a truly extraordinary company, not only in terms of business performance and operational excellence, but also risk management. Our engagement with the regulators -- and this goes for all of them and particular the OCC and the Fed, is an ongoing engagement. We get their feedback constantly and we therefore are called upon to respond to it constantly. And that sometimes means that we have to work hard to understand exactly what their expectations are for us. I have really had an opportunity through my meetings earlier this week to understand exactly what their expectations are. And although our work is in various stages of progress, some of it is way down the road and is really pointed toward completion and implementation. Other parts of it are a little bit earlier in the process. I think, I have a very good handle on where we want to go with them and I think that they've been very clear with us. The single most important thing I think to note is that we have really done a good job of restructuring our balance sheet so as to be able to operate under the asset cap for over a year. And we are going to do whatever is necessary to ensure that we can continue to serve our customers for as long as the asset cap is in place. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, guys. Maybe you guys can touch, you talked a bit about the mortgage banking business and the competitors, the nonbank competitors are taking market share from everybody, not -- that's the way the business has been structured. And John, in the past, you've talked about your nonbank financial lending. I believe that portfolio\u2019s over $100 billion. How much of the mortgage warehouse lines are in that portfolio, assuming they are in that portfolio, and how are they growing? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So, good question. I would say mortgage banker warehouse lines are a smaller portion of that total non-depository financial institution total. We'll get you the exact total. But, we do provide warehouse lines to people who deliver into Fannie and Freddie, just like we do also by correspondent loans into our own mortgage banking pool, which becomes part of our origination stats and part of our gain on sale. So, like a lot of these businesses, mortgage is one of them. The people with whom we compete who are outside of banking are customers of ours. We give them access to the capital markets. We finance them along the way. We understand the underlying loan. Sometimes, they're making loan where we are competing head to head, and sometimes they're making loans where we'd rather be in a credit-enhanced position on a pooled basis than be making the loans head to head. That's more of a commercial loan example. But, in the mortgage case in particular, we do provide warehouse lines and we do facilitate the sale of their conforming loans into agency execution. Gerard Cassidy : I see. And what -- how would you categorize the largest component of that portfolio? What type of credits would you say are in that portfolio that constitute the majority or the biggest portion? John Shrewsberry : Of the $100 billion or so... Gerard Cassidy : Yes, correct. John Shrewsberry : It's pretty balanced. There is the CLO business; there is CMBS; there is RMBS; there is card; there's other commercial assets, like leased assets et cetera where our customers are leasing companies. It's quite diverse. But, it's more corporate risk than mortgage risk. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, good. And then, following up on your comments, if I heard it correctly that I think you said foot traffic in ATM transactions are down, I thought I heard 9% or at least they are down. Are those trends accelerating? And did Zelle have any impact on the trends, picking up in terms of the P2P payments that happened with Zelle and now that's in place, what, about a year and a half? John Shrewsberry : No, I don't think so. I think Zelle is taking some cash out of the system, it's taking checks out of the system as well. So it hasn't been accelerating. It's been relatively linear and it's been this conversion to all forms of digital banking activity, not just P2P payments. Gerard Cassidy : Great, I appreciate it. Yes. Go ahead. Go ahead, John. John Shrewsberry : I was going to say, you can see the details on slide 23. That's all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja. Vivek Juneja : Hi. I just want to follow up on all the regulatory stuff that's been going on. The regulators\u2019 comments that things have been very slow. Given all the hiring you've been doing, it\u2019s a little bit surprising. I guess, Allen, a question for you. How much do you need to do the changing the culture? Because it seemed a tone of dismissiveness among senior management when this asset cap first came out, and is there still more you need to do on that? And as we parse through and try to understand where this quite surprising level of commentary from the regulators, which you rarely see a bank named of your size like this, is it coming more on the consumer side, the corporate side, can you give us more color as to where is more of this weakness? Allen Parker : Yes. Vivek, thank you very much for your question. I think that it's appropriate to say that there was always a sufficient level of seriousness on the part of our senior management in terms of approaching the Fed consent order. We early on marshaled what we thought were the necessary resources to get everything done and in a manner of appropriate urgency and thoroughness. As time has gone on and there's been greater clarity about all the work that's been done and the expectations of the regulators, we've continued to focus on everything that needs to be done. I think, above all else, I would say to you that the effort that we're talking about, which is enhancing corporate governance protocols, establishing an even stronger risk management framework and achieving true operational excellence just takes a certain amount of time. And we're doing that methodically, but we're also doing it in conjunction with our regulators as they provide us with constant feedback. And the other thing that I will say is that when we're going forward with respect to the asset cap now, one of the things that we feel is critical to do is to get the input of our new Chief Technology Officer and our new Chief Auditor who are going to be -- one of whom, our Chief Technology Officer, has just arrived, and our Chief Auditor will arrive soon. We believe that their input, analysis, creativity will be a critical part of not only satisfying the requirements of the consent order but getting them done in a way that's appropriate for the Company that we want to be. I would say that the feedback that we have heard is really not directed to any line of business. It's really our larger corporate functioning in terms of our control system and framework for risk management. And those are the things that we're going to continue to focus on. And as I said to you before, we are going to do all that work with what we believe is the appropriate level of urgency, but we are not going to prioritize urgency over getting it right. This is just simply too important for our Company going forward. It's work that's going on every day. I am confident that we get better every day and I am also confident that we'll get to the right conclusion. John Shrewsberry : I\u2019ve got one follow-up, and it's also I think responsive to Matt's question earlier, but just playing back to last year or so and how this has evolved. There's is an initial level of high level, medium level and extraordinarily detailed planning that goes into an evolution like this, and then there's the initial hiring of the senior most change agents people with real experience to augment the folks that we have in the field doing the work. And as Allen mentioned, this covers the entirety of the Company. This isn't something that just happens in a group called risk, this happens in every line of business in every function dealing with every business process. So, you plan it at varying levels of granularity, senior hiring, next level hiring, and by hiring, it can be people who already work here moving into slightly different jobs, but it's articulation of what those jobs are, what real roles and responsibilities are to accomplish the goals. And then, you begin the execution phase. And the execution, again, it's business by business, function by function, process by process. And it's the identification of risk and associated controls for effectiveness. It's the testing of those controls and making sure that it works from end to end, and then, the development of the appropriate supporting technology, because a lot of these things initially can be done by brute force but are more appropriately and done at a higher quality level, more efficiently with technological enablement. That comes along behind it. Then, you have to understand what maturity looks like because you never get everything exactly right, completely right the first time when you want to make it -- the customer impact has to be understood, the team member impact has to be understood in addition to the capability. And then, you go into a cycle of sustainment and improvement. That's what's going on. And it takes a while to do that from one end of the business to the other from top to bottom, business by business, function by function. Allen Parker : And Vivek, I would also just comment because I'm sure it's on your mind. I've had the opportunity to get out and speak to a very large number of the people who are on the Wells Fargo team, and also, as you would expect, had the opportunity to meet with every member of the operating committee over the last couple of weeks. These are leaders who have performed extremely well in various uncertain circumstances. They have been empowered by me and by our Board to move forward on the Company's priorities and they are highly engaged and motivated and above all else, they're really enthusiastic about what we can achieve. So, again, that's the source of my own personal optimism. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thanks. And yes, I mean, look, you do have a great franchise. So, it is important to protect that and grow that. I have another question completely different, if I can just shift gears and this is probably appropriate for John. John, the business payroll services business you just sold, you mentioned the gain to us. What is the impact from a revenue and a net income standpoint; any rough numbers? Allen Parker : It's negligible, not discernible. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi. Hate to beat the dead horse on the NII commentary, but obviously it does move the needle on numbers. John, am I -- what are you assuming for deposit betas in that guide? Are we assuming that you get to the 45% cumulative beta since the start of the cycle that you've expressed as sort of a normal run rate? Is that embedded in that guide and how quickly do you get there? John Shrewsberry : It assumes continued -- our beta assumptions assume continued catch-up to the historic norm, which if it doesn't happen, as I mentioned earlier... Saul Martinez : Okay. John Shrewsberry : That is tied to that forecast. Saul Martinez : Okay. And the historic norm is 45%. Is that correct? John Shrewsberry : It depends on the mix, but it's the -- the range goes all the way to 55%. Saul Martinez : Okay. Because if I -- you're through the cycle beta of 35%, which is based on I guess the 89 basis points. If the Fed funds goes -- stays where it's at, that would imply, by my calculations, you go to like 110 basis points in an environment where the Fed funds isn't moving. I mean, is that -- are those numbers right? Is that logic right? John Shrewsberry : Well, I'm sure your math is right, but we have the -- what happens when we shift from non-interest bearing to interest bearing, we have... Saul Martinez : Yes. John Shrewsberry : The higher cost, as I mentioned, from things that we're doing in retail around the edges for promotional attempts, market by market to understand what high-yield savings and CDs due to the mix. Those are higher cost retail deposits. Saul Martinez : Yes. John Shrewsberry : The consumer beta has been really, really low since the beginning of the cycle. And so by doing these things around the edges, we're moving it relatively meaningfully -- without repricing the whole core of that portion of deposits. Saul Martinez : No, I get that. It just seems like a big delta in an environment where the Fed funds rate is flat. And in fact we plug that into any -- if I plug that number into any of my models for any of my companies, it's going to be hard to see any NII growth for anybody. But I'm just trying to get a sense of as to whether there is a level of conservatism built into that deposit beta. John Shrewsberry : It may be. You might expect us to outperform them relative to what we've just talked about. But we're -- I think it's cautious to be -- we want to be frank with what the outcomes might be. We think this is what the outcomes might be. That's one area where there's -- where there's the opportunity to outperform depending on what happens in the market. Saul Martinez : Got it. I guess if I could change gears a little bit and talk about costs, fully appreciating that the new CEO will ultimately determine what -- if and what the guides will be or the expectations will be beyond 2019. But you have outlined $2 billion of cost initiatives, I guess that are in place and you've talked about them with -- and a lot of details. But is there a way to kind of think about what's already in place that's going to happen regardless, whether it's systems modernization, digitizing processes, organizational realignment, and what's may be a little bit more discretionary that might be able to be more managed a little bit and could have some variance in terms of the outcome? John Shrewsberry : Yes. The items that we have on slide 20 where we're showing you at least the relative expectation for cost takeout for 2018 and 2019 and the general Howard's categorizing where those are coming from will show you that the expectation is even higher now, and it includes the types of things that you mentioned, and as the prior slide shows, it's a good thing that it's higher because we're reinvesting more where we need to, et cetera. All of the types of things that you mentioned are things that we're going after hard. If there was a -- if there's a risk to it and I think we've accounted for it in our guidance, is that as we're -- as we're prioritizing, for example, capacity and technology or resources to get things done, there are some of these initiatives that have a bit -- whether it's digitization, automation or some technological solution to them that have to -- that will fight for priority along with the risk and regulatory related capabilities that are technologically dependent too. Again, I think we've captured that in our outlook, but those trade-offs are being assessed every day because as you could -- at this point in time, with all of the -- the possibilities of what technology can bring to the businesses, there are -- there's a boundless list of things that we'd all like to do. Saul Martinez : Got it. And I guess, just the final quick one, John. I was a little surprised by the CECL estimates positively. But I guess broad-strokes, the reversals you might get in C&I because they're shorter -- shorter duration or remaining lives on them more than offset any sort of increase you'll see on your resi book or I guess your consumer book as well. Is that sort of the... John Shrewsberry : That's exactly right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Chris Kotowski : When you've had experience in -- with companies under consent orders in the past, historically it's been about things like asset quality or capital levels and you could kind of visualize what success looks like. I mean, that success would be having capital levels and up to peer standards and a world-class underwriting system and so on. And when it comes to something like operational effectiveness, it's just harder for me to understand. Like, in this process, are you being benchmarked against other companies and the regulators expect you to come to standards that can be observed in other companies that are out there? Or is it kind of an uncharted territory where there are expectations above and beyond that are not quite easy to quantify? Allen Parker : Obviously, Chris, as you know, we're -- when you talk about consent orders, we're looking at a number of different ones and some of them are in more focused areas in terms of our businesses and our operations. With regard to the Fed consent order, there are really kind of two categories there. One is the -- the focus on corporate governance, which is really the role of the Board and the interface as between the Board and the Management of the Company and I think they're -- what we are all really looking for is what I would term as almost an ideal state, what's the appropriate role of the Board, what's are the appropriate processes the Board should apply and what are the proper levels of interface as between the Board and Management. I think in some respects, that is not necessarily a philosophical exercise, it's actually a highly structured exercise, but it's also informed by traditional notions of corporate governance and what the Fed thinks the proper role of the Board should be and we've completed a great deal of work in that regard. With regard to the other parts of what we're doing, those things really focused on operational risk and compliance and I think just going back to your question, Chris, it's a combination. It's somewhat of benchmarking, but it's also a focus by us and by the Fed on what would be the ideal state for us to be in. There is a great deal of work under the rubric of operational risk and compliance. You have to focus on things like operational issues, regulatory issues. We're talking about customer remediation and one of the biggest aspects, as we've alluded to is the simplification of business processes. We want to all reach a place where we have fewer manual controls and fewer errors. I think it cannot be described as something that's being done on a whiteboard because there are number of reference points, but I would say, if anything, we are all trying to achieve something that maybe almost an outer boundary in terms of the quality of operational risk and compliance, something that hasn't really been achieved at this level before. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : Just, sorry, and we're going to go right back to the NII. Does that NII outlook -- does it assume any ongoing reinvestment of your excess liquidity position because I would assume that, if you do continue to use that to fund new loan originations, it could help temper the impact of the expectation that you're seeing on the deposit costs side? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Yes. It certainly does assume that we fund our expectation for risk asset generation through the available liquidity that we have. So within the bound of what's likely in terms of risk asset opportunity, I think it's captured in the forecast. If there were other interesting things for us to invest in, whether it was loans or securities we'd do it, but on the securities front, I think given where we are in terms of yield of risk free rates and spreads, we've accounted for what is within our appetite and on the loan front, as I've mentioned before, we're competing vigorously in every market that we're enthusiastic about to grow loans. So that is all in the forecast, I don't think there's a -- unless there is a shift in aggregate demand for credit across the business or consumer space. I don't imagine a real breakout there. John Pancari : Okay. All right, thanks. And then, I'm not sure if this was explicitly asked, but based upon your commentary around the factors influencing the NII guide, how would you characterize the NIM progression from peers. I mean how much incremental compression do you see from now to the end of the year for example? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Well, I'm more of a dollar person than a NIM percentage person, but you could see the trajectory down somewhat. The big variable will be what happens with deposit pricing with sort of a range of outcomes depending on whether they follow this historic path or the path toward an historic beta or whether they settle in at a lower response rate, but if we're right in down 2% to down 5%, then we'll certainly be somewhat down from here. John Pancari : Okay, thanks. And then, John\u2026 John Shrewsberry : And then dollars -- yes, they\u2019re just for everybody's benefit. It's about the dollars of net interest income and their impact on our ROE generation that we are more focused on rather than the outcome calculated NIM. John Pancari : And then, John, one more for you. I know you have talked quite a bit about expenses and everything, but for this change specifically on your NII guide, is it fair to assume there is no cost offset just simply because on the upside there is not much of a cost to margin expansion and everything and therefore on the way down, there couldn't be or do you think -- or is there some type of cost offset to this change that may still get dialed in? John Shrewsberry : Yes. I think of them separately. If there were, we would take it. And there is -- as we described, there is probably 200 programs going on right now that we're updating month-by-month to go after every bit of available efficiency opportunity. On the one hand, separately, we're reinvesting everywhere we need to and we'll continue to from a control risk and regulatory perspective. But if there is any low hanging fruit on the expense side, we'd be after it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : I usually don't like hammering questions that we've been talking about so much, but there is another aspect of this I did want to bring out. So, two fronts. One, John, on the net interest margin and NII numbers, you have been derisking your balance sheet quite a bit to free up capacity for your core customers. And you mentioned that the sale of Pick-a-Pay, you've been doing that. Your margin really year-over-year is only down 2 or 3 basis points with all that derisking that's been going on. So, is this just as much of a structural shift in your balance sheet in the sense of how you've underperformed because other banks aren't really derisking like you all have been. And so in my mind that is over time and at least looking back over the last couple of quarters, that's really been more the impact? John Shrewsberry : Absolutely. I'd say that Pick-a-Pay is a piece of that, the reliable auto business in Puerto Rico is a piece of that for sure. And then, of course the rundown of the junior lien mortgage loans are a piece of that also. We don't usually talk about the asset quality or sort of the risk adjusted NIM because it's not a risk sensitive concept, but without a doubt, our asset quality on average is as high as it's been in some time. Now, with respect to Pick-a-Pay, because of the way they've been marked historically, you can argue about what their loss content might be. And people ask from time-to-time, why do we consider that risky given that we've carried them at such a markdown rate. And unrelated to asset quality I make the point that those are loans that we would not originate today and as we go into the next cycle, they have more operational risk associated with them because defaults and foreclosures are going to be higher there and we just assumed to have less of them when the next cycle hits rather than morph. Marty Mosby : And really what we're talking about is higher yielding loans that have been run off that because they're not really core relationships like you said you wouldn't reoriginate these. So, these weren't core relationships, they just happen to be higher yielding. So, you're kind of derisking and you're getting the incremental balance sheet usage pushed out to free up capacity for that core, which just has a lower margin than some of these higher yielding portfolios had? And then, when you look at your deposit pricing in a sense of talking about this tail end, this has been a cycle where deposit betas have been much better than historic averages. What has caused you to want to assume that all of a sudden, the performance is going to get that much worse, and there\u2019s big catch-up versus the stability that we're already starting to see in deposit pricing that's in the market today. Bankrate.com rates have already started to flatten out, if not come down a little bit. So, I don't really see the inclination to keep assuming for this other than just a measure of conservatism. So, I just want to see what you saw in the market that makes you want to incorporate this? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So, very specifically, our own cumulative beta trailing 12 months today is 43% and a quarter ago, it was 38%. So it feels like our experience is that we are catching up a little bit. Now, through the cycle beta is still much lower as you're pointing out, and this could very well be the end of it if. If the risk-free rates aren't moving, if the Fed is not moving anymore, but we're taking what we've just seen in this quarter and extending it out a little bit, which if we're wrong, then, we will -- it's not causing us to run around and raise all of our deposit prices, but it is causing us to forecast on what might end up being a conservative basis. Marty Mosby : And then, Allen, I was going to ask, when you start getting at talking to the regulators, would you have a chance to do -- I mean, I can't imagine that you'll have been passive or not trying to be as aggressive as possible to fix the issues. I mean, this has been a very critical issue for the Company and it's been something that I think the management has been talking about for since the beginning. This is the most important thing to deal with. So what specifically do you walk away with from those meetings in the sense of -- we've heard a lot of generics, but I mean, what in the -- how do we amp up from what we've been doing or is it more like the [indiscernible] bank situation, when you just explain we're kind of setting the stage or we're setting the new standard that then everybody will have to come to, it just takes long to get there, and they're just kind of keeping the pressure of the regulators or to make sure that you can kind of set the bar for everybody else as you go through this changing process that you've been working on? Allen Parker : Marty, it's a really good question, and I think there could be something to your notion that we are setting a new standard, and if so, that's perfectly okay with us. We really want to be the best company that we can possibly be. We have been serious. I think that we're going to do everything we can to do an even better job. We're going to redouble all our efforts and all of us on the operating committee have made clear to everybody on the team that we're just going to do a better job across the board, planning, hiring, motivating people, improving the quality of the work that we do, and above all else, just to execute on what we know we can do. I mean, this is an extraordinary team and if anything, we just have to work harder to bring to appropriate conclusions the things that we have in flight. So yeah, we're on a journey, but I think we're journey people, motivated and excited about because it's a journey to a great place. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, I wanted to ask a question on profitability targets. At 2018 Investor Day, you provided profit targets. It assumed a flattish revenue environment versus '17 and if I look today, that core revenue run rate is about $5 billion below that level and it's certainly encouraging to hear that you remain committed to the expense goals for '19, especially during this period of, let's just call it CEO purgatory, but given the significant revenue shortfall that exists today, I'm wondering if there's any sort of commitment to deliver on the targets that had been outlined at that point in time, whether it's 14% to 17% ROTCE or the efficiency targets. I think I'm just trying to understand what targets if any shareholders should be holding the current management team accountable to. John Shrewsberry : Those are good questions. So with respect to different people's definition of core revenue, there will be, as we've talked about some of the fundamental line items that are relatively easy to track and how they perform through cycles, we also have a recurring -- different people will ascribe different levels of reliability to it, but different types of gain taking et cetera, that's -- or gain generation that you could add to the top of that depending on what the market is delivering to us. On expenses, we\u2019ve reupped for this year. We've talked about the fact that in 2020, it\u2019s appropriate given the fact that a new CEO will be in and then importantly in that, return generation is our capital plan and getting the denominator down because we carry a lot of excess capital and I think that shareholders should hold us accountable for executing, for delivering and performing on our capital plan as well. So at this point in the cycle, where we are with rates, we're going to apply every lever within our risk framework for generating the right mix of loans and investing in the right mix of securities and non-interest income. We're leaning hard in the areas where we generate trust and investment fees, deposit service charges as mortgage and certain market-sensitive categories in particular, and then frankly, most importantly, I think our shareholders will hold us accountable for the execution that Allen has described of moving the ball down the field against our regulatory commitments in 2019 and into 2020 as well, but those are very concrete steps that people can point to that will have outcomes attached to them. Steven Chubak : Okay. But, could we hold management accountable when discussing some of those outcomes to the targets that have previously been outlined, or do we have to take a simply wait-and-see approach? John Shrewsberry : Well, I think for this year, since we've reupped on expenses, we certainly can. I think for 2020, what we're telling you is we're going to have a different CEO. And so that's -- it's hard for us to put words in that woman or man\u2019s mouth before they've arrived. And on the capital plan, for sure, I think that you should hold us accountable for that. Steven Chubak : Okay. And then, just one follow-up for me. There was an earlier question discussing the prospect of restructuring of strategic alternatives. And I recognize it's still early days in that search process. But one of the businesses that's gotten a lot of attention in some of my investor discussions is wealth management. It's clearly been impacted by the account scandal, but there are a number of firms that have actually indicated very strong interest in growing, whether it's organically or inorganically, in this particular area. And I'm just wondering, given the steady pace of advisor attrition, strong interest from peers to maybe pursue M&A in this area, whether you would be -- open to considering a strategic sale if it offered a path to creating greater shareholder value, or said differently, if somebody else can maybe better monetize the asset? John Shrewsberry : Yes. In the relatively near term, I certainly doubt it. I think that the wealth opportunity given our 70 million customer footprint and the attachment to our core banking capabilities, what we do in mortgage et cetera, all are probably, they provide a path to the greatest value creation. The changes that Jon Weiss is making in running that business I think will continue to generate a high level of value creation. The way you've phrased the question, it presupposes that it would be a higher value creation for Wells Fargo shareholders if we did that. And of course it's an obligation of the firm to look at anything like that. I just doubt that that would be true. So, it's not on the short list of things that we're talking about as we've been doing the noncore trimming here and there like retirement, for example most recently. But as you say, if anybody made a proposal to Wells Fargo that was value maximizing for our shareholders, that's our job is to respond to that. Allen Parker : Let me close by thanking all of you for joining our first quarter conference call. And as always, we'd like to thank all our team members for their hard work, dedication and enthusiasm. As I hope we've made clear on the call this morning, this Company is not standing still during this interim period and our team members are a critical part of our moving forward. We look forward to speaking with all of you again next quarter. Thanks very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, my name is Regina and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplements are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today, containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement.  Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Allen Parker. Allen Parker : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us for today's discussion of our second quarter results, which included strong quarterly earnings. On our call last quarter, I outlined my three top priorities for Wells Fargo, which are focusing on our customers and team members; meeting the expectations of our regulators, and continuing our company's important transformation. This morning, I want to update you on the progress we made on these priorities over the last 90 days. After spending a lot of time meeting with and listening to our team members and customers across Wells Fargo, it's clear to me not only that our team is dedicated to providing outstanding customer service, but also that this commitment is benefiting our customers who are choosing to do more business with us. Our results in the second quarter reflected our progress in this area. And I would call your attention to just a few of the metrics that demonstrate that progress. Period end loans and deposits grew on both the linked quarter and year-over-year basis. Branch customer experience survey scores have now increased for four consecutive quarters and in June, reached their highest levels in over three years. Primary consumer checking customers grew year-over-year for the seventh consecutive quarter. New investment assets referred by our community banking team to our Wealth and Investment Management team reached their highest quarterly level in two years. And by continuing to meet our wholesale banking customers\u2019 needs for asset-based financing during the quarter, we increased our industry leading market share in these financings. Our commitment to our team members during the second quarter included the completion of our 2019 team member experience survey, which gave all our team members an opportunity to share their feedback. Feedback we\u2019ll use to continue to improve the team member experience through new technology, streamline processes, and career and skill development programs. We also continue to strengthen Wells Fargo's leadership team through both internal promotions and external appointments. In the second quarter, we added three new members to our operating committee. Two of these additions were Saul Van Beurden or new Head of Technology and Julie Scammahorn, our new Chief Auditor, and the most recent change to the operating committee was the addition of Derek Flowers, who will lead our newly created Strategic Execution and Operations Office. As a result of the changes in our operating committee over the past three years, almost all its members are now either new to Wells Fargo or new to their roles. The formation of the Strategic Execution and Operations, or SEO team is an important step in our work to meet the expectations of our regulators, which is another of my top priorities. This team will focus on achieving across all our businesses, the operational excellence that will enable us to execute more effectively on our regulatory priorities and further drive our transformation, which will benefit all our customers and team members. By centralizing a substantial part of the work related to our regulatory priorities, work that's being performed across all our different businesses, we believe will be more efficient and effective in all these efforts. The leader of the SEO team, Derek Flowers is a 21 year company veteran, who most recently was our Chief Credit and Market Risk Officer, where he maintained our strong credit discipline and in the process displayed substantial skills in organization and execution. Reflecting our deep management team Mary Katherine DuBose, who joined Wells Fargo in 1998 and was most recently a leader in wholesale banking, has assumed the role of Chief Credit Officer and Jeremy Smith will lead market and counterparty risk. I'm confident that Mary Katherine, Jeremy and their teams will continue our company's strong tradition in both these areas. My final top priority is continuing the important transformation of Wells Fargo so that we can build on our already strong foundation to become even more customer focused, innovative and better positioned for the future. This transformation is multifaceted, but it involves three essential components. First, we must strive for excellence in the way we conduct our business every day. Our work must be thoughtfully designed, seamless, and of the highest quality. And we must also constantly look for ways to improve, whether that improvement involves simplifying an operation, using technology to make things faster and easier, or seeking ways to be more streamlined and efficient in our work.  Second, we must focus on and achieve high quality execution in all we do, approaching each task with urgency, a well-designed plan and an unwavering focus on getting the work done properly and on time. And finally, each one of us must act with absolute integrity in every situation. It's just a few examples of the work we're doing as part of our transformation. We're relentlessly focused on business process management, an effort to ensure a more consistent approach to how our work is done by simplifying the ways we conduct any given process and reducing the associated risk. This work is designed to achieve savings, enable our team members to be more productive and deliver more consistent desired experiences for our customers. We're also pursuing business simplification, so we can concentrate our efforts on businesses where we believe, we have the leadership position that's required for us to excel long-term. On July 1st, we completed the previously announced sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, and we expect to complete the recently announced sale of Eastdil Secured in the fourth quarter. We're also transforming our businesses to reduce risk, improve customer service and become more efficient. An excellent example of this work is our auto business. Throughout 2017 and 2018, under the leadership of Laura Schupbach, we made fundamental changes to this business, including centralizing functions by consolidating 57 business centers across the country to create [for] [ph] regional hubs, reengineering processes, automating pricing and decision making and enhancing the customer and team member experience. As we were implementing these changes, we ceded market share as expected and reduced the size of our auto portfolio. Now with most of these transformational changes complete, our auto portfolio returned to growth in the second quarter for the first time since 2016 and in line with our expectations. Just as important this growth has been disciplined and has resulted in a higher quality portfolio. As part of our ongoing transformation, we\u2019ll continue to make similar fundamental durable changes in how we run our businesses throughout the company. Let me close my remarks by touching on a few additional topics. We realized that you are all appropriately focused on the level of our expenses, while we're making progress and continuing to address our expenses with urgency. We still have work to do. And as John will explain we expect our 2019 expenses to be near the high end of the range we specified in our previously provided guidance. As we stated last quarter our strategic and financial targets beyond 2019 will be established once we have a permanent CEO in place, but we\u2019re still at the point where the savings we\u2019re achieving are not reaching the bottom line. And we anticipate that this could continue next year.  We\u2019ll update you further on our 2020 expense expectations over the remainder of this year. I know you're also interested in the status of a CEO search, which is a top priority for our Board of Directors and is well underway. While there has been and will continue to be much speculation in the media and otherwise regarding the search, the Board and the search committee do not plan to provide updates on their progress until they have made a final selection. Accordingly, we don't have any additional information to provide today. Separately, I want to note that during the second quarter, Charles Muskie was elected to our Board of Directors, where he will serve on the Audit and Examination Committee. Chuck has many years of leadership experience at large financial institutions and other major corporations, both as a Director and as an Executive and we\u2019re all looking forward to working with him. Finally, as you all know, we received non-objection to our 2019 capital plan during the second quarter. The capital plan includes a 13% increase to our third quarter 2019 common stock dividend to $0.51 per share, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. And gross common stock repurchases of up to $23.1 billion for the four quarter period beginning third quarter 2019. Our CCAR results demonstrate the strength of our diversified business model, our strong capital position, our sound financial risk management and our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders in a prudent manner over time. We're all committed to doing what's right for all our stakeholders and we\u2019re proud of the work we completed during the second quarter to bring us closer to our goals. While there's a lot of hard work that still needs to be done, I'm confident and optimistic that we\u2019re taking the right steps to build an extraordinary financial institution. John will now discuss our financial results in more detail. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Allen. Good morning, everyone. We share some of the highlights of our second quarter results on page two, including earnings of $6.2 billion or $1.30 per diluted common share. Our ROE increased to 13.26% and our ROTCE was 15.78%. We returned $6.1 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends, and net share repurchases in the second quarter, up from $4 billion a year ago. In his comments, Allen highlighted the positive business momentum shown on this page and I'll provide more detail on these results throughout the call. On the next page, we summarize noteworthy items in the second quarter, including a $721 million gain on the sale of $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans. The remaining balance in the Pick-a-Pay PCI loan portfolio was $1.1 billion at the end of the second quarter, down from $8.8 billion a year ago, reflecting portfolio sales and runoff.  We had $150 million reserve release, primarily driven by strong overall credit portfolio performance and our effective income tax rate was 17.3%. We currently expect the effective income tax rate for the remainder of 2019 to be approximately 18%, excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items. We highlight some year-over-year results on page four, compared with the second quarter 2018 revenue was stable with an increase of $477 million in noninterest income largely offset by a $446 million decline in net interest income. Our expenses declined 4% from a year ago. I will highlight the key drivers later on the call. Our net charge-offs remained near historic lows at 28 basis points and our $150 million reserve release in the second quarter was the same amount as a year ago. Our capital levels remained above our internal target, even as we reduced common shares outstanding by 9% from a year ago.  I'll be highlighting the balance sheet and income statement drivers on pages five and six throughout the calls, we\u2019ll turn to page seven. Average loans were up $3.4 billion from a year ago, but declined $2.5 billion from the first quarter, driven by lower commercial loans. The average loan yield was up 16 basis points from a year ago from the repricing impacts of higher interest rates, and it declined 4 basis points from the first quarter due to changes in loan mix and the repricing impact of lower interest rates. Period-end loans increased $5.6 billion from a year ago with growth in first mortgage, C&I and credit card loans partially offset by declines in junior lien mortgage loans as well as commercial real estate loans. Over the past year, we've sold or moved to held for sale a total of $9 billion of loans. In addition to the $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loans that we sold in the second quarter, we also moved $1.8 billion of first mortgage loans to held for sale. We moved these loans to held for sale as we intend to sell them rather than recognize recoveries and retained earnings as we would be required for adoption of CECL. I\u2019ll highlight the drivers of the $1.6 billion linked quarter increase in period-end loans starting on page nine. Commercial loans increased $19 million from the first quarter, C&I loans were down $288 million, as growth in our credit investment portfolio from purchasing CLOs in loan form was offset by declines in commercial capital, corporate and investment banking and commercial real estate credit facilities to REITs and non-depository financial institutions.  Commercial real estate loans increased $105 million from the first quarter, the second consecutive linked quarter increase, as growth in mortgage lending was partially offset by runoff of construction loans reflecting cyclicality of commercial real estate construction projects and our continued credit discipline. Lease financing increased $202 million from the first quarter, driven by growth in our equipment finance business. As we show on page 10, consumer loans increased $1.6 billion from the first quarter despite $1.9 billion of Pick-a-Pay PCI loan sales and the transfer of $1.8 billion of first mortgage loans to held for sale. The first mortgage loan portfolio increased $1.9 billion from the prior quarter, driven by $19.8 billion of mortgage loan originations held for investment. 38% of our total mortgage originations in the second quarter were held for investment, which was up from 26% a year ago. This shift benefited loan growth and helped us meet the home financing needs of our customers. But these loan originations do not generate mortgage banking fees. Junior lien mortgage loans were down $1 billion from the first quarter, as paydowns continue to outpace new loan originations. Credit card loans increased $541 million, up from a seasonally low first quarter. As Allen highlighted, our auto portfolio grew for the first time since 2016, with the balances up $751 million from the first quarter and originations up 17% while maintaining credit discipline. Other revolving credit and installment loans declined $533 million from the first quarter, on lower margin loans as well as lower student loans and personal loans and lines. Turning to deposits on page 11, average deposits declined $2.3 billion from a year ago as wealth and investment management and wholesale banking customers continue to allocate more cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives. Average deposits increased $6.9 billion from the first quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits, reflecting increased promotional activity, partially offset by lower wealth and investment management deposits. Our average deposit costs of 70 basis points increased 5 basis points from the first quarter and 30 basis points from a year ago, reflecting higher deposit rates in wholesale banking and wealth and investment management, deposit mix shifts as customers allocated more balances to higher yielding categories, and retail banking deposit campaign pricing for new deposits. We provide an update on our deposit betas and expectations on page 12. Our deposit beta reflects current market conditions, including repricing lags from prior Fed Funds rate increases and deposit campaigns for new retail deposits, which have resulted in a greater percentage of higher yielding promotional deposit balances. These drivers are reflected in the cumulative one year beta increasing to 57%, up from 43% last quarter. It's important to note that the deposit beta calculation can produce higher short-term betas in periods when Fed Funds stabilizes or declines, even if the pace of increases and deposit pricing slows. The cumulative beta since the start of the cycle in the fourth quarter of 2015 was 38% as of the end of the second quarter. If the Fed Funds rate remains at current levels, we expect our cumulative through the cycle beta to continue to trend upward albeit at the lower end of our previously guided range of 45% to 55%. On page 13, we provide details on period end deposits, which increased $24.4 billion from the first quarter. Wholesale banking deposits were up $37.4 billion from the first quarter with growth in corporate and investment banking, commercial real estate and corporate trust and also included an elevated level of large short-term deposit inflows. Consumer and small business banking deposits declined $12 billion driven by lower wealth and investment management deposits from the seasonality of tax payments, as well as clients continuing to reallocate cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives. Retail deposits also declined, as growth in CDs and high yield savings was more than offset by typical tax related seasonality. Net interest income decreased $216 million from the first quarter, driven by balance sheet mix and repricing including the impact of higher deposit costs and lower interest rate environment, as well as $73 million from increased premium amortization costs from higher MBS prepayments. We currently expect MBS premium amortization to increase in the third quarter. These declines in net interest income were partially offset by one additional day in the quarter and higher variable income. Net interest income was down 4% in the second quarter and down 2% in the first half of 2019, compared with the same periods a year ago. Last quarter, we said we expected net interest income to decline 2% to 5% this year compared with 2018. And if the rate environment we're in today persists, we would expect to be near the low end of the range or near 5%. As always net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors, including loan growth, pricing spreads, the level of rates and the slope of the yield curve.  Turning to page 15, noninterest income increased $191 million from the first quarter, with broad base growth including higher trust and investment fees, other income, service charges on deposit accounts, card fees and mortgage banking. I'll highlight some of the drivers of these increases in more detail. Deposit service charges increased $112 million from our first quarter that had higher fee waivers. We expected deposit service charges to increase now that the customer friendly changes we've made, which meaningfully reduce these fees are fully on the run rate. These changes continue to benefit our customers. And in the second quarter, we send an average of more than 38 million zero balance and customer specific alerts a month and helped over 1 million customers avoid overdraft charges through overdraft rewind. The increase in deposit service charges in the second quarter also reflected higher treasury management fees in wholesale banking. Trust and investment fees increased $195 million from the first quarter, primarily due to higher asset base fees on retail brokerage advisory assets, reflecting higher market valuations at March 31st, and higher investment banking fees from increases in debt and equity underwriting.  Mortgage banking revenue increased $50 million from the first quarter, as lower servicing income primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, including higher loan payoffs was offset by higher mortgage origination fees. Mortgage originations increased $20 billion from the first quarter due to typically higher seasonality and higher refi volumes from lower interest rates. Applications in the second quarter increased $26 billion from the first quarter. We ended the quarter with a $44 billion unclosed pipeline the highest pipeline since the third quarter of 2016. And we expect originations to increase in the third quarter. Residential held for sale mortgage loan originations totaled $33 billion in the second quarter, and the production margin on these originations declined to 98 basis points, down 7 basis points due to sales execution timing. Margin started to widen later in the quarter and we currently expect the production margin in the third quarter to increase modestly. Turning to expenses on page 16, expenses declined 3% from the first quarter and 4% from a year ago. I'll explain the drivers starting on page 17. Expenses were down $467 million, from the first quarter, driven by seasonality lower personnel expenses. The decline in compensation and benefits reflected $676 million in seasonally lower personnel expense and $243 million in lower deferred compensation expense, which is P&L neutral, partially offset by the full quarter impact from salary increases, as well as one additional payroll day. Revenue related expenses increased $260 million from higher commission and incentive compensation expense, primarily in home lending, WIM and wholesale banking. Third-party services increased $212 million from higher outside professional services and contracts services expense. Finally, running the business discretionary expense increased $105 million, primarily driven by higher advertising and promotion expense. As we show on page 18, expenses were down $533 million from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses, core deposit and other intangibles amortization and FDIC expense. While our expenses declined in this quarter as Allen stated, they're still too high, and we're working hard to deliver on our 2019 expense target. Since the beginning of 2018, we\u2019ve realized billions of dollars of expense savings through our efficiency initiatives including reducing FTEs by approximately 18,000 through attrition and displacement. However, during this period, we've also added approximately the same number of FTE in risk compliance and technology, resulting in our total FTE being relatively stable. We currently expect our 2019 expenses to be near the high end of our target range, as investments in risk management, including data and technology have exceeded expectations and are anticipated to continue. Also, revenue related expenses are higher, given the strength in mortgage banking due to lower rate environment, as well as strength in capital markets. Just to be clear, we won't forego revenue opportunities to hit an expense target. Finally, our deferred comp expense was $471 million in the first half of 2019, compared with $57 million for the same period a year ago. Since this expense is subject to market fluctuations and is P&L neutral, we're excluding the deferred comp expense from the calculation of our expense target. As a reminder, the full year impact of deferred comp expense last year was a $242 million reduction in expenses and we achieved our expense target even with this benefit. Turning to our business segments starting on page 20, community banking earnings increased $324 million from the first quarter, driven by seasonally lower personnel expense. On page 21, we provide our community banking metrics. We have $30 million digital active customers in the second quarter, up 4% from a year ago, including 8% growth in mobile active customers. Primary consumer checking customers grew for the seventh consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. New consumer checking customers acquired through the digital channel were up 45% from a year ago and 48% of new general purpose credit card accounts were originated through the digital channel in the second quarter. We already highlighted our brand survey scores, which reached their highest levels in more than three years in June. The recent improvement in our scores has been partially driven by an increased focus by our branch based team members on educating our customers about our industry leading digital capability. On page 22, we highlight the decline in teller and ATM transactions, down 7% from a year ago, reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels, and we consolidated 38 branches in the second quarter. We had strong card usage with both credit and debit card purchase volume up 6% from a year ago. During the second quarter we were recognized for the third year in a row as the number one debit card issuer in Nielsen's annual rankings. Turning to page 23, wholesale banking earnings increased $19 million from the first quarter, driven by lower provision for credit losses. Wealth and investment management earnings increased $25 million from the first quarter, driven by seasonally lower personnel expense and higher asset based fees. The sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, which closed on July 1st, did not impact second quarter results but will be reflected in our third quarter performance. Turning to page 25, we continue to have strong credit results with our net charge-off rate declining to 28 basis points in the second quarter, and net charge-offs down $42 million from the first quarter, driven by lower consumer losses. Non-accrual loans declined $983 million from the first quarter with lower non-accruals in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Consumer non-accruals included a $373 million decline from the reclassification of $1.8 billion of first mortgage loans to held for sale. Last quarter, I provided our initial CECL expectation, which we've updated based on the composition of our loan portfolio as of June 30st. We currently estimate that the impact of the adoption of CECL will be an approximate $1.5 billion reduction in our allowance, including recoveries related to residential mortgage loans that were previously written down during the last cycle and are below their current recovery value. The change from the estimate we provided last quarter primarily reflects a reduction in our expected recoveries on loans previously written down due to the designation of $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans to held for sale, as well as additional refinements to our assumptions and changes in our portfolio composition during the quarter. The ultimate effective of CECL will depend on the size and composition of our loan portfolio, the portfolio\u2019s credit quality and economic conditions at the time of adoption, as well as any refinements to our models, methodology or other key assumptions. As a reminder, as the industry experiences credit cycles, we anticipate more volatility under a lifetime reserving approach versus the incurred loss approach. Turning to capital on page 26, our CET1 ratio fully phased in increased to 12% as continued strong capital returns and modest RWA growth were more than offset by the capital generation from earnings and unrealized gains in OCI.  Our 2019 capital plan, which includes up to $23.1 billion of gross common stock repurchases, reflects our goal of reducing our CET1 ratio toward our current internal target of 10% over the next two years. As a reminder, our target may increase modestly to 10.25% to 10.5% due to the implementation of distress capital buffer and CECL. Similar to last year, our current plan subject to market conditions and management discretion is to use approximately 65% of the gross repurchase capacity during the second half of this year, with the remainder use in the first two quarters of 2020. In summary, our second quarter results reflected increased customer activity, strong credit performance and higher capital returns. Our expenses are too high and while we're working hard to execute on our expense initiatives, we also have higher ongoing investment spend. I'm confident that the investments we're making to transform Wells Fargo and meet regulatory expectations will benefit all of our stakeholders including our customers, our team members, our shareholders and our regulators.  And we\u2019ll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Allen Parker : Hey, John. John Shrewsberry : Good morning, John. John McDonald : Hi, good morning guys. John, on the net interest income outlook, so you indicated that if the rate structure and environment stays the same, you'd be at the low end around 5%, which is consistent what you said before. Just wondering, does that include the idea of a Fed cut or price in any Fed cuts? And if not, what would be the incremental impact of each Fed cut, if you did get some from there? John Shrewsberry : So it does account for one to two, depending on when they happen, et cetera, this year. And if you just wanted to isolate a 25 basis point Fed cut, and if really only the front end was moving in the long end it was not. We estimate that in the first year that's worth a little bit under $100 million. John McDonald : Okay. And into -- if you're at negative 5 for the year that assumes one to two cuts? John Shrewsberry : Yes. John McDonald : Okay. And then could you elaborate on Allen's comments about the expenses, previously you had indicated some confidence, not in a specific target for 2020, but at least having 2020 expenses lower than 2019? Is that something you're less confident in now? And what was the comment about kind of the jumping off into 2020? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Sure. So we\u2019re re-forecasting every 90 days. And our most recent forecast puts us at the higher end of our range for this year. And currently, our reforecasted 2020 is relatively flat with that number. Things will change will continue to reforecast all of these initiatives are in play. But this renewed vigor and emphasis on getting things right from a risk and control with associated technology perspective has put upward pressure on that. John McDonald : Okay. Got it, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hey, guys. So a couple follow-up questions -- to John's questions. First, just elaborating on the commentary on expenses I think which said Allen was we've generated billions of dollars and expense savings. They haven't flown to the bottom line because you've had incremental investments in things like I believe risk management, regulatory compliance, operational risk.  So are you saying that in 2020, if you're assuming sort of relatively flattish expenses, any incremental cost saves will be offset by additional investments in these things? Because I would think that at some point you have these investments in the run rate, and you actually start to see it flow to the bottom line, especially given what -- to be what seems like somewhat bloated cost structure relative to your peers. Allen Parker : Saul, thank you for your question. Let me just start by saying that as you would expect, we're all very focused on our level of expenses, and we're doing everything we can to engage in vigorous risk management. We're going to continue to do that. As John alluded to, what we've seen is a greater need for us to make investments in terms of risk, compliance, and audit. All those things that we're going to need to make investments in, in order to satisfy the requirements of our regulators, but also, at the same time build the financial institution we know that that we can be. Those are our needs that in some cases are evolving over time and where we're making decisions about what incremental investments we need to make. And as I said at the outset, we do believe that that sort of increased investment can be an offset, or could be an offset to the savings that we expect to achieve in 2020. Saul Martinez : Okay, all right. That's helpful. To change gears on NII and deposit betas, you've given color on what\u2019s sort of embedded in your guidance for deposit betas, assuming I guess the Fed Funds remains at current level. How do we think about deposit costs, though, if the Fed cuts in July, and has multiple cuts this year? Just, not necessarily the beta, but just the trajectory of deposit costs.  And, also migration [DBs] [ph], how much of a lag do we see between when the Fed starts to cut and when we actually see a stabilization in deposit costs? Because usually that will take -- that could take a quarter or two. And how much scope is there for deposit costs to come down this cycle, given that, on the upswing deposit betas were lower than what they have been in past cycles? So can you just help us understand some of the moving parts of it around deposit costs of the Fed cut? John Shrewsberry : Sure, it's a good question. One question you didn't ask is, of course, what happens on the asset side of the Fed cuts and they move immediately. So it's a little more painful for the first couple of quarters because LIBOR assets or prime assets for that matter price down right away and deposit costs take a little bit longer. And there's less room to move, because as you pointed out, we have an all in deposit cost right now of 70 basis points after all the moves that we've had in Fed funds. And so we will be -- I mean, it will be easy enough, I suppose in the most -- in the highest beta deposit categories on the way up, it will -- we have the easiest time moving down. But where we've continued to outperform, in the big, massive consumer deposits, et cetera, deposits are still really, really inexpensive, and there isn't as much leverage on the way down. So it will take a couple of quarters, I think, as you suggested to sort of fully stabilize and then we will be repricing down quickly where we can where we were quick to give depositors the benefit on the way up. And less likely, for example, for promotional activity to exist in exactly the same way, but it'll take a little bit. And I'm not sure that in a normal policy reversal with a stair step path down for Fed funds, how long or if ever, you get back down to the single digit basis points in total that we had as a deposit cost in the wake of the financial crisis. Saul Martinez : And in your guidance of one to two rate cuts, what are you -- I guess, are you baking in sort of an immediate recalibrated reduction in asset yield? And then, sort of a lagged effect on deposit costs. I\u2019m not asking you to give me the specific numbers, but directionally kind of how\u2026 John Shrewsberry : That\u2019s exactly right. [indiscernible] have the contracts operate on the asset side, and then there's the behavioral things on the deposit side that we just talked about. Saul Martinez : Got it. All right, thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. John Shrewsberry : Hey, Ken. Allen Parker : Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hey. Thanks, good morning guys. On the business sale side you guys have talked about I think the expected contribution or detraction from the retirement sales and then Eastdil in the fourth quarter. Can you give us an update of how you're thinking about just the portfolio of businesses? And are there other things that you still might think of also that don't fit with the slim down company going forward and how are you thinking about those? John Shrewsberry : I would say that the list is pretty short right now in terms of things that we\u2019re working on or thinking about when this year is done and the two things you mentioned are closed. I think we will be opportunistic and our eyes are open, but there isn't much else that's in the immediate runway. And that\u2019s distinct from asset sales that we\u2019ve conducted where the economics have made sense, or the risk return made sense we\u2019ve talked about that with Pick-a-Pay and now some of the loans that have this asymmetric CECL impact are loans we might sell that\u2019s just different from businesses. We have also incidentally sold packages of mortgage servicing rights over the last year, you\u2019d probably expect to see us do some of that so we can optimize our mortgage servicing portfolio. But in terms of discrete businesses the list is -- I would say is pretty short after the two that are closing later this year or the one more that\u2019s closing later this year. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then just one more follow up on the cost side earlier this year, you had talked about how your underlying cost control have been doing even better and have been offset by the incremental investments. And I guess as you recalibrate it would seem that you were kind of on a steady-state basis doing a really nice job of whittling down the programs as you had discussed previously. And so as you look ahead on the side of the equation are there more opportunities to offset incrementally some of the incremental adds that you still have to contemplate through next year and beyond. John Shrewsberry : There is enormous opportunity on the cost takeout side. The question for our team right now is how to prioritize that versus getting things right from a risk control and compliance perspective. Because in some cases, those desires are competing for the same technology resources, for example, are the same subject matter expert bandwidth, for example. There is a very long list of ways to make Wells Fargo continually more efficient and getting that prioritized along with some of these very urgent requirements in our risk and control environment is really what the management team is most highly focused on. But there is an enormous opportunity for cost compression as we get better and better on the control side as we get better and better on the business process management side, as Allen said, we\u2019ve hit the tip of the iceberg in terms of the possibility of simplifying and streamlining how we get our operations done. Ken Usdin : Got it. Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Erika. Erika Najarian : Hey, good morning. Wanted to just ask another question on expenses if I may, so you mentioned that you had concluded this quarter that there is a little bit more work to do and given consensus expectations for 2020 of $51 billion. I think the reforcasting to flat to 53 may surprise the market. And what you mentioned in your responses to my peers is that a lot of the investments this year have to do with control and business processes.  I\u2019m wondering though if you are done recalibrating sort of how you are thinking about investment. In other words I didn\u2019t necessarily hear anything in terms of offensive technology spend and I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s going to take a longer time for us to see that cost opportunity, because you\u2019d rather prioritize a transformation of the franchise both on a regulatory side and on the offensive side so to speak on tech. John Shrewsberry : Yes, it\u2019s a great question and it\u2019s part of why a quarter ago we suggested that 2020 was cloud for us to forecast given that there's a new CEO on the way in because the questions that you are asking are critical ones that will a new CEO, a permanent CEO is going to have a point of view on. In the meantime, what we\u2019re focusing on is as we just described, the trade-off -- not really a trade-off, but the prioritization of risk and control related expense to improve our environment to make ourselves better operators and to achieve the objectives that have been held out for us. And it does deprioritized somewhat either, further efficiency development or in some offensive activity. There's still plenty of offensive activity going on. But those of that we\u2019ve set, Allen has set that the priorities that we're operating under currently along with the Board. And as we look out a year, I think it makes sense to contemplate that there'll be somebody else at the table who has got a meaningful voice of it. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just one more follow-up question, I promise. Allen, I fully appreciate that you can\u2019t give us an update on the CEO succession. I'm wondering though, if you could share, since you have been with the company since March of 2017, and Wells Fargo is making progress, I'm wondering if having the interim position transition into prominence as part of the consideration for the Board. Allen Parker : Well, Erika, let me start by saying that the search is being conducted by the independent directors, primarily through a search committee. And as a result, I haven't been involved in the search. There has been a lot of speculation back and forth about the candidates in the process, but as you know the Board said at the beginning, they wouldn't be providing any sort of updates along the way as to process or candidates. Knowing the Board members, they're focused on doing this right. They're working to identify somebody who understands the challenges that Wells Fargo is currently working through, but also understands its extraordinary potential. When the Board asked me to take on the interim role, I assured them that I would do the best I could in the role for as long as we -- as long as they needed me. And that's really what I've been focused on, trying to move the company forward together with the operating committee to the best of my ability. But from the very beginning they said they were going to be seeking someone from the outside, and as far as I know they have never wavered from that. Erika Najarian : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. John Shrewsberry : Hey, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. You guys have given some very specific net interest income clarity for this year. Any thoughts on where it might bottom? You did allude to some further balance sheet optimization, potentially still to come, as you think about de-risking. And frankly, like when I look at consensus, it seems like maybe it's not thinking about it right, where it bottoms out. So any thoughts on either where it bottoms with whatever rate assumption you want to use, or maybe kind of the exit 4Q 2019 level and some of the puts and takes to consider next year. John Shrewsberry : Yes. So I -- as it relates to optimization, we've -- the loans that we've talked about that we intend to move out, I think encompass, at least the way we're thinking about it today, pretty much the whole opportunity. There aren\u2019t other legacy portfolios of higher yielding loans that we\u2019re deemphasizing. So that will run its course, auto is growing. So that looks a little bit different and will have an impact for next year. And 2020 is going to be impacted by where we finish this year, what's going on with loan and deposit flows, this discussion about where deposit pricing for our peers -- for us and our peers is at that time, depending on whether the Fed is marching down or if things are very stable, and of course, could go either way and it\u2019s relatively benign economic environment overall and can't see a compelling course for much more action than what people are currently imagining or having priced in. So we could -- if we stabilize in the mid-ones from a Fed Funds perspective, for example, what that means for deposit pricing that'll matter. And then at the long end of curve, if we get some steepening, we've got a little bit since we were below 2% in the tenure. If we get more steepening from there, that creates a bigger reinvestment opportunity. And I think, on an annualized basis 50 basis points at the long end, it's probably worth, $400 million, $450 million to us over the course of a year based on our average pace of reinvestment. But that'll have a big impact. So how all of those things land is going to make a difference. One thing that we haven't talked about and as much as these rate cuts and the interest rate environment are making a little bit harder for us to make money to the extent that they really do elongate this recovery and we end up with benign credit conditions and we end up with robust consumer spending and flows and businesses remain healthy and borrow and continue to invest even at these relatively subdued levels. That's an interesting trade off as a bank, because we've got a lot to -- a lot of good things happen from an extended expansion. So I can't -- that matters in terms of how we respond to the question, because of the rates of loan and deposit growth will be different in the continued expansion than they would be without it. So all those things matter. Right now the\u2026 Matt O\u2019Connor: Now just the back half\u2026 John Shrewsberry : Go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Sorry. Go ahead. John Shrewsberry : No, no please. Matt O\u2019Connor: I'll just say, how about just the back half of this year, obviously, the bond premium amortization is going up in 3Q, which is a drag to net interest income. Does the net interest income dollars bottom in 3Q in your rate assumption or is there a further decline in fourth quarter? John Shrewsberry : I don't have the two quarters side-by-side in front of me, but we do in our in our expected case is down just a little bit less than 5% from where we are today. And if we do get a 25 or even 50 basis point cut in the third quarter, my sense is that the fourth quarter is going to be the one that bears the brunt of the impact of that as assets repriced down quickly. So, I think about that way. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. All right, thank you. John Shrewsberry : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes in the line of John Pancari with Evercore. John Shrewsberry : Hey, John. Allen Parker : Hi, John. John Pancari : Good morning. On the headcount point you made that you added 18,000. Do you expect additions on that front to continue in the risk and oversight area? And then also, is there any way you can help us size up, how big is your risk department now in terms of headcount? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : So the specific answer to how big the risk department is, is 11,000. It's hard to apples and apples compare that with others, depending on where people draw lines between who does what to whom. For example, where a big testing group sit whether they sit in the risk department or in an operations department or someplace else. But my guess is that we will end up -- well, we have we have open positions now. So we will be continuously adding for a while to risk. And when I say risk, risk is sort of a -- are the people who work for the Chief Risk Officer. It's the second line in the financial services parlance, but there are people in control functions in the businesses who are doing the actual work, right. So the risk department is setting policy and looking into businesses and setting expectations for businesses and testing the businesses, but the businesses are controlling their own risks. And those are areas that have had to be developed, staffed up, et cetera, particularly around -- really the focus here would be operational and compliance type risks. I think our credit risks, our market risk, etcetera, have been historically very strong and continue to be today. So the newer muscle that's being developed in all of the businesses are these control teams, who go process-by-process, product-by-product and transaction flow by transaction flow to as Allen said, try and ensure excellence in what we do so that we're not generating unexpected operational risk or compliance failures. John Pancari : Thanks, John. And then how does that 11,000 headcount level compare to before the sales practices that you surfaced? John Shrewsberry : Yes, it's another apples and oranges because people weren't all in the same place, but it's at least doubled over that time frame, if you\u2019d put it on the apples-to-apples basis. John Pancari : Okay, thanks. And if I could ask just one more, just want to see if you have anything -- any kind of color, you can provide on the status of where you stand with the DOJ, the DOL, and sec investigations? Thanks. Allen Parker : At this point, there are really no developments to report our discussions with them have been ongoing, but at this point, there are no developments that we can really disclose. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thanks, Allen. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. John Shrewsberry : Hey, Betsey. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Question, a candidate have asked the question on the expenses from a different angle. I'm interested in understanding how much of the investment spend that\u2019s going on here is or the incremental investments that\u2019s going on in supporting revenue growth, not just the risk management side of the business. John Shrewsberry : Yes, it's tough to draw a line. I would say that on the investment spend front, if you're thinking about like enabling technologies or new capabilities, et cetera. It's a minority of the investment spend. The majority of it is really more on the things that we're talking about in terms of compliance and risk management. But having said that, the downside of not being excellent in those areas was produced it's more than its share of cost over the last few years. So from economic perspective, it's probably we got as high an NPV as anything else that we're doing. But specific as it probably be as less than half and more than half. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then on branch rationalization, I noticed that, your branch rationalization numbers have been increasing. Do you feel like you're at pace there? Or is there a room for that to accelerate? I'm just wondering, how much of branch rationalization is in your run rate today? John Shrewsberry : It's a great question. So there is two kinds of branch rationalization, there's the consolidation of branches where we take two branches that are close by that are -- and we study the patterns of their customers and realize that if we close one, we're going to -- we\u2019ll capture and retain virtually all of the customers using the remaining open branches in the market. And we've done a lot of that and we've had very good success at retaining virtually all of the deposits associated with that. So that will run its course, because we will take out all of the consolidatable branches based on geography over some period of time. But Mary has been working, and her team are working really hard on that. The other kind, which is either selling or closing branches has been something that we've done a little bit of, we sold the package of 50 odd branches to Flagstar in the middle of or toward the end of last year. And these are discrete market areas where it's slightly outside of our supply lines or outside of our core market and it's a better set of assets to be owned by somebody else. So we've got other packages of those that we've considered, but as deposits have gotten a little bit more expensive and as premiums have been a little bit less reliable, the economics of that move around from time to time. So we've been thinking -- we've been looking at those packages and opportunities and thinking about the competitive dynamics in the markets. And so we haven't really pushed any since we sold that first package, although there are others that probably make sense. And then there are some branches that may just be worth closing because there wouldn't be a natural buyer. And we don't have any branches for which the costs exceeded the revenue. So it's not really an urgent matter. But there are some that are more or less efficient than others, some that are very low growth, some that are harder to service, et cetera. And all that is in the calculus.  So I think we had -- Mary had said a couple years ago that she thought we're vectoring it on 5,000 branches down from 6,300 at the outset of the program, I think we're probably in the 5,400 range right now. And I think she has got line of sight down to about 5,100. And then the question is how hard do we want to push and what's the deposit value calculus for those -- for the last remaining ones. Betsy Graseck : Okay. John Shrewsberry : All against this backdrop of the secular decline in the kind of routine branch visits that you see in our numbers as people do more and more of the routine stuff digitally. Betsy Graseck : Now does the branch strategy have any impact on the loan growth? I'm just wondering, if as you are coming to the end of the branch rationalization process does there have an impact on loan growth in the various categories? John Shrewsberry : It could have an impact on -- it will have an impact on loan growth, it will have an impact on deposit growth and it will have an -- including new customer growth, and it'll have an impact on referred asset growth on the -- to the advisory side, because people do those things in branches. So those are all -- those we've experienced it, we witnessed it, and we try and calculate what we think that's worth and that's part of the calculus that Mary's team runs as they refer loans to mortgage or refer student loans or refer small business loans or refer assets to the -- to WIM, et cetera. Those are all healthy byproducts of the branch system and the things that you lose when you close a branch. Betsy Graseck : Yes, I mean, do you feel like any numbers around what loan growth pressures are in your run rate and when you are done with the branch rationalization, do you feel like there could be some uplift there? John Shrewsberry : Yes, I guess, there could be. I think there's a couple other things that are contributing to the same phenomena. In the wake of sales practices, it took a long time, or longer than expected time for branch personnel to really get back in the groove of making as many recommendations or referrals as they had previously. I think we've gotten better at that they've gotten better at that overtime.  So that's sort of contributing to a rebound in the number, I think we're trying to make it easier for people to do business with us digitally. And so, we wouldn't have this drop off in quite the same way, when a branch closes and that's going on at the same time. So we haven't teased out the pieces of what's not happening, as a result of those branches closing. We have picked up the primary checking customer deposit number, so you can do it apples-and-apples. But on referrals there's nothing to specifically attribute. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes in a line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, how are you. John can you share with us LIBOR obviously in this quarter fell pretty dramatically relative to Fed Funds and you guys gave us a nice break out of the NIM following to 2.82%. How much would you point to as the LIBOR drop contributing to that decline? John Shrewsberry : Actually not that much, I would say so one month LIBOR I think drop 6 basis points in the quarter if I\u2019m right about that and it didn\u2019t contribute that much to the drop in our -- I think our commercial loan yield overall dropped by a single basis point. So not that much there is other things going on, there is spread compression going on, going the other way we also had some recoveries in that line, and we had some fees that got amortized into that line as well. But LIBOR was going against us, but I wouldn\u2019t point to that and say that that was the source of a big piece of what happened in NIM, it was a piece. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then second, if I recall last year's CCAR you guys were able to repurchase a good portion of your shares in the first couple of quarters of CCAR and essentially frontloaded the buyback. Can you share with us what the outlook is for this year's CCAR in terms of the allocation of the buybacks each quarter, is it again frontloaded like last year or is it more evenly split over the four quarters? John Shrewsberry : The expectation is in the first two quarters we will do about two thirds of it and then the second two quarters the remaining third. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Couple of questions, one simple one, how much is the expansion revenue impact of the business sold to principal, which close on July 1, and how much would come from Eastdil? John Shrewsberry : Yes, so there is nothing in the second quarter, as we said. We will disclose all of the bits and pieces of principal in our 10-Q in a couple of weeks. So we haven't really announced that yet but you will see it. Importantly, we will be operating under a transition services agreement with principal for a period of time. So on the expense and even FTE side you'll see those numbers in our run rate for a period of time. We will call them out. So it's easy to adjust for it, but they don't all disappear on the closing date. And then Eastdil, we'll talk about that when it closes at some point in the fourth quarter and you guys very specific guidance as a way to think about how to calibrate what the impact it has on Q4 and then the impact it will have on 2020. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And the expense guidance you just give for 2020, John, does that factor in the sale of Eastdil, I recognize from your comments that principal obviously won't have much of an impact at least for the near-term? John Shrewsberry : It does not yet account for the impact of the sale Eastdil, so their numbers are in our run rate until it actually happens. And then, again, we will adjust -- we will allow people to make adjustments and we will too for what comes out. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Second one for you, John, trading revenues could you break those out that your total trading revenues between FIC [ph] and equities and give us this quarter as well as something comparable for last quarter and a year ago? John Shrewsberry : I don't have all that in front of me. I don't know that we -- I don\u2019t think as a matter of course we break it out that way, which didn\u2019t say that we couldn't or shouldn't or we won't but we don\u2019t currently do that. As you would expect, I would say disproportionately on the trading revenue side the bid offer in fixed income products represents a much bigger piece than $0.10 per share on the equity side. And then in the total related revenue, the contribution, which is more of a derivative mark to market or carry from equity derivatives probably makes a bigger impact it looks more like a fixed income business, frankly. So, we will some consideration as to whether that is going to be helpful as specific disclosure going forward, but I don\u2019t have it all sitting in front of me. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Steven. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. John Shrewsberry : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So wanted to start off with a question on capital targets. Just given your strong CCAR results, and your pretty steady and consistent track record there some encouraging commentary we just got from the Fed on managing to maybe a smoother planned transition from CECL inclusions in CCAR. I'm just wondering whether your thinking has evolved at all around the 10.25% to 10.5% target. That you guys had said it previously, whether there's any potential for you to manage to a lower target, if you continue to demonstrate strong results within CCAR? John Shrewsberry : That's a great question. And as soon as we see the NPR on the stress capital buffer, and have a real sense for how CECL will get implemented in stress than we\u2019ll know and we will update. We've -- I think we've been a little conservative suggesting that the combination of both of those things has suggested to-date that there'd be more volatility in capital requirements, which probably means that most GSIPs, that the margin would need to carry a little bit more so that they didn't end up having a shortfall on a particular CCAR date. Again, because stress capital buffer works as a point estimate and is -- and can create that kind of volatility, if whether it's by multi-year averaging, or in some other way, they reduce the risk of a hard transition like that then we may very well consider operating with capital target that we have today. We just we don't quite know enough. I'm hoping that in the next couple of quarters we\u2019ll really know and then we'll just -- we'll pick a number and defend it.  But that's what's caused us to imagine 10.25% to 10.5% and until -- and now of course, we're expecting this NPR that should really help us understand what our target could be or should be. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just one follow up for me, just a question on the securities book, the blended yield right now is still pretty elevated above 3% today. I know continued yield pressure is contemplated as part of the 2019 guide for NII. But as we look out to 2020, I was hoping you could speak to philosophically what type of securities you might be reinvest in, as the book matures, and maybe what your blended reinvestment rate sits at today given the current shape of the curve? John Shrewsberry : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So the investable universe for our investment portfolio has shrunk over the course of the last several years because of capital -- a finer point on capital allocation and for liquidity purposes and other reasons. So the big buckets or the biggest bucket for us is agency mortgage securities, but the big buckets are RMBS, a handful of different high grade corporate securities. We've got a reasonably large muni book, and then we've been a big CLO investor for some period of time. And I mentioned earlier that some of that or more of that actually is getting done in loan form starting in the first quarter and continuing into the second quarter. So given market depth, market size, what's available, et cetera, I think we're going to end up continuing to do more in agency mortgage securities. The CLO universe is only so big, the muni universe is only so big and high grade corporates are, as this is the wrong point in the cycle to be incrementally leaning much harder on that.  And so as we do our various trade-offs, thinking about shape of curve, cost of funds, OCI risk, spread risk, the range of things and of course, available sources of liquidity, it pushes us more towards agency mortgage securities. And in terms of yield targets or what's rolling on, rolling off. So we sort of make determinations, alco-by-alco [ph] and implement them throughout the course of any quarter. But suffice to say that we sort of -- with few exceptions, we continue to try and stay invested rather than then look for particular target and pile in. We sort of scale up when the opportunity is a little bit bigger, and we scale down when the opportunity is a little bit worse. But because of the nature of prepayments and amortization and other cash flow coming off of that portfolio, this need to sort of continue to go back and make those determinations is constant. But it's going to reflect the market that we're in as we reinvest. Steven Chubak : Helpful color. I'm going to sneak one more in if I may, just on fee income. Some of the key trends, including card income, deposit service charges, it was encouraging to see them being quite positively this quarter. I know there's some seasonality in these line items, but just curious what your outlook is for some of the biggest fee buckets in the second half. And are the -- I\u2019m also wondering if the impacts of customer friendly actions are now fully baked into the run rate today? John Shrewsberry : So, yes, on that last question. So in trust and investment fees, if the S&P remains above 3000, then you should feel pretty good about the second half, because it was a pretty direct correlation between how that line item performs, plus inflows minus outflows, but the big piece of it is being multiplied times the S&P times of fee rate. So that feels pretty good, this is a good time for mortgage, the capacity constraints in the business are leading to expanding margins into the third quarter, this is the busy season. So my sense is that that's going to feel pretty good in the second half of the year. On deposit service charges, so, yes, we're comping over the customer friendly actions, we did have a disproportionate level of fee waivers in the first quarter, which makes the first quarter to the second quarter probably look like a little bit of steeper jump than I would trend from this point forward. Because we're always doing business with more customers and we've had increases in treasury management as well and wholesale, which flows into that line. So that's good. On card fees, that will be more seasonal as you expect. Fourth quarter is a big quarter, first quarter is a low quarter, so second quarter is recovering from the first quarter based on consumer spending patterns. And so I wouldn't expect two to three to look like one to two in terms of the shape of that curve. Hopefully, that's helpful. Steven Chubak : Very helpful. And thanks for taking my questions. John Shrewsberry : Yeah, you bet. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Eric Compton with Morningstar. John Shrewsberry : Hello, Eric Compton. Eric Compton : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple questions. I'm going to go back to expenses. And my first question is just, do you have any sense of, I guess, what percentage of the investments have ramped up in 2019 and it sounds like they're going to be ramping up even more in 2020? What percentage are permanent versus what you might be able to roll off, once the build-up is done? John Shrewsberry : Yes, it\u2019s a good question, there will definitely be role off as processes mature, as business process is simplified, as we do things in fewer ways and supporting technology. Similarly, compresses and simplifies, it's hard to put a number on that the -- but there's the expectation and the understanding among everybody here who is building enhanced capability is that once built, it needs to be on a path to continuous improvement. Because we are getting simpler, we are getting more automated, our customers are getting more self-serve, we're reducing the number of products et cetera, and more and more controls are moving to an automated state.  So, whenever a bundle of process goes through that, peak to maturity timeframe, the expectation is just to pick a number that you can have a line of sight into call it down 20%, down 30% for those activities. That's certainly how we thought about it when we rolled up our staff groups into mature portions of them. But we'll be giving more color on that as we come closer and as we get through the peak build in some of these areas of capability. Eric Compton : Got you, that's helpful. And to wrap it up, so I just want to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. So it sounds like the kind of the amount of investment in 2020 should be assuming underlying cost saves were kind of the run the business type stuff in the background, kind of the incremental investment and the compliance risk management stuff that\u2019s ramping up even more in 2020, I guess this is the first part of my question. And then two is, is that related at all or is there a connection between that and feedback from and or progress with the regulators? John Shrewsberry : So what you'll see in 2020 is the full year effect on the add side of things that are being added throughout the course of 2019, at a minimum. There may also be areas where net new capability, staff, supporting technology, et cetera is like it has been in 2018 and 2019 is added in 2020. But at a minimum, you'll see a full year effect of what's been added during 2019. Just like on the cost save side, we'll get the full year benefit of costs that have been taken out in 2019, in 2020.  And on the second part of your question without a doubt, with every new leader that joins us with a particular area of expertise, there's -- that creates feedback for us to execute against and with every bit of everybody feedback from many of our stakeholders including regulators, there's -- there are -- it creates a clearer vision of what good looks like and people build in that direction. So that feedback has been helpful. Eric Compton : Great. Appreciate you taking my questions. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. Operator : I\u2019ll now turn the conference back over to management for any further remarks. Allen Parker : Well, thank you very much. Let me close by thanking all of you for joining the second quarter conference call. As always we like to thank all of our team members for their hard work, dedication and enthusiasm and their perseverance and resilience. We look forward to speaking with all of you next quarter. Thanks again to all of you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our Interim CEO and President, Allen Parker; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our Web site at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site. I will now turn the call over to Allen Parker. Allen Parker : Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for today's discussion of our third quarter results. Our earnings included a number of significant items that John Shrewsberry will discuss, but I'll note at the outset that our underlying business fundamentals were strong. That strength was demonstrated by, among other things, increases in loan and deposit balances both from the second quarter and from a year ago, our highest branch customer experience scores in over three years, and continued growth in primary consumer checking customers. As you all know, Charlie Scharf will join Wells Fargo next week as our new CEO and President. I've had the opportunity to spend a great deal of time with Charlie, and I'm convinced that he has the right combination of experience, business savvy, and leadership ability to position Wells Fargo for an even more successful future. I look forward to working with Charlie on a seamless transition as he assumes his responsibilities as CEO, and I return to my role as the company's General Counsel. It's been an honor for me to serve as our Interim CEO and President over the last six months. I am proud that during my time in this role, the company continued to move forward, and we made progress on our top priorities, which include focusing on our customers and team members, meeting the expectations of our regulators, and continuing our company's important transformation. Let me provide just a few examples of our most recent progress. In the area of leadership, we made important hires during the third quarter in Technology, Merchant Services, and Wealth Management. In addition, within Consumer Banking, we named leaders to new roles that will help us better serve our customers. David Kowach, who was most recently the head of Wells Fargo Advisors, assumed a new role as the Head of Community Banking, reporting to Mary Mack. We created this role because we believe that having a single dedicated leader supporting our team members and customers in our branches will significantly further our ongoing transformation. We also formed within Consumer Banking, a new Enterprise Customer Excellence Group that will, over time bring together functions from across the company and give us broader insight into the customer experience. This new group is under the leadership of Andy Rowe, who led Consumer Segments and Consumer Strategy for the last two years. And in the area of innovation and technology, we made several important announcements during the third quarter. Wells Fargo's ongoing commitment to exploring and investing in emerging technologies through the Wells Fargo Startup Accelerator program was demonstrated by our adding two new companies, one focused on augmented reality and the other focused on climate change risk. The total number of companies in that portfolio is now 25. We also announced plans to pilot, next year, Wells Fargo Digital Cash, which is designed to enable us to complete internal booked transfers of cross-border payments running on our first distributed ledger technology platform. This new technology should drive operational efficiencies by providing longer operating windows and real-time processing. Finally, we announced a data exchange agreement with Plaid, a leading data platform. With this agreement, our customers will have greater control over the bank account information they share with Plaid-supported apps, including the ability to turn on or off data sharing through Wells Fargo's Control Tower. I want to conclude my comments this morning by thanking the members of our operating committee, our other senior leaders, and all our team members for their efforts, dedication, and perseverance during the last six months. In particular, I want to thank Doug Edwards for his strong and thoughtful leadership as our Interim General Counsel during this period of transition. We continue to have a lot of work ahead of us, but the unwavering focus of our team members on serving our customers are also working tirelessly to transform Wells Fargo has enabled us to make substantial progress toward our goals over the last six months. Looking forward, I am confident that the extraordinary strings of the Wells Fargo franchise, when combined with our new leadership and our collective commitment to work hard to achieve further improvements will result in a company that is well-positioned to benefit our shareholders and all our other stakeholders. John will now discuss our financial results in more detail. John Shrewsberry : Thank you, Allen, and good morning everyone. We had a number of significant items in the third quarter that impacted our results, which we highlight in slide two. We had $1.9 billion of operating losses, predominantly reflecting litigation accruals for a variety of matters, including a $1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual for previously disclosed retail sales practices matters that was not tax deductible and reduced EPS by $0.35 per share. We had a $1.1 billion gain from the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, which contributed $0.20 per share to EPS. We had gains of $302 million from the sales of $510 million of Pick-a-Pay PCI, and other PCI residential mortgage loans. We had $244 million in mortgage servicing rights valuation adjustments driven predominantly by higher prepayment rate estimates on our MSRs. These valuation adjustments resulted in our mortgage banking revenue declining from the second quarter despite an increase in mortgage originations and higher production margins. We had a $105 million impairment of capitalized software reflecting reevaluation of software under development. We also had a modest $50 million reserve build compared with the $150 million reserve release last quarter. Finally, we partially redeemed our Series K Preferred Stock, which reduced diluted EPS by $0.05 per share as a result of elimination of purchase accounting discount recorded on these shares at the time of the Wachovia acquisition. This partial redemption will reduce the amount of our quarterly preferred stock dividends by approximately $23 million, starting in the fourth quarter. While our financial results in the third quarter were impacted by these items, as Allen summarized and we highlight on slide three, we continue to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity. We\u2019ve reviewed some of our year-over-year results on page four. Compared with the third quarter of 2018, revenue was stable with an increase of $1 billion in non-interest income driven by the sale of our Institutional Retirement and Trust business, largely offset by a $947 million decline in net interest income. Our expenses increased $1.4 billion from a year ago, driven by $1.3 billion of higher operating losses reflecting higher litigation accruals. Our net charge-off rate remains near historic lows at 27 basis points. We had a $50 million reserve build in the third quarter compared with the $100 million reserve release a year ago. We maintained strong capital levels even as we reduced common shares outstanding by 9% and increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 19% from a year ago. I will be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on page five throughout the call, so we will turn to page six. Our effective income tax rate increased to 22.1% in the third quarter, reflecting a net discrete income tax expense of $443 million, predominantly related to the non-tax-deductible treatment of the $1.6 billion discrete litigation accrual. We currently expect the effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 17.5%, excluding the impact of any unanticipated discrete items. Turning to page seven, average loans were up $10.3 billion from a year ago and increased $2.3 billion from the second quarter. This was the first time we had both year-over-year and linked quarter growth in average loans in nearly three years. Period-end loans increased $12.6 billion from a year ago with growth in C&I, first mortgage, credit card, and auto loans partially offset by declines in commercial real estate, junior lien mortgage, and other revolving credit and installment loans. We grew loans even as we sold or moved to held-for-sale a total $7.4 billion of consumer loans over the past year. I will highlight the drivers of the linked quarter growth in loans starting on page nine. Commercial loans were stable linked quarter as growth in C&I loans and leased financing was largely offset by declines in commercial real estate loans. C&I loans were up $2 billion with broad based growth in corporate and investment banking and the purchases of CLOs in loan form in the credit investment portfolio. These increases were partially offset by declines in commercial banking and lower government and institutional banking and middle market lending and in commercial capital driven by seasonally lower commercial distribution finance dealer floor plan loans. Commercial real estate loans declined $2.2 billion from the second quarter with declines in both commercial real estate mortgage and commercial real estate construction loans reflecting increased market liquidity, higher refinancing activity, and continued credit discipline. Leased financing increased $276 million from the second quarter, driven by growth in large ticket direct finance leases in equipment finance. As we show on page 10, consumer loans increased $5 billion from the second quarter. The first mortgage loan portfolio increased $4.2 billion from the prior quarter driven by $19.3 billion of originations held for investment and the purchase of $1 billion of loans as a result of our exercising service cleanup calls to terminate over 20 pre-2008 securitizations. This growth was partially offset by pay downs as well as sales of $510 million of PCI mortgage loans. Junior lien mortgage loans were down $1.2 billion from the second quarter as pay downs continue outpaces new originations. Credit card loans increased $809 million primarily due to seasonality. Our auto portfolio continued to grow with balances up $1.1 billion from the second quarter. Originations increased 9% to $6.9 billion. We have been successfully regaining market share while maintaining our credit discipline. Our market share growth reflects the benefit of the transformational changes we have made in the business including process improvements that have resulted in faster credit decision response times. Turning to deposits on page 11, average deposits increased 2% from both a year ago and the second quarter. Average deposits increased $22.4 billion from the second quarter with growth in wholesale banking as well as retail banking deposits which continue to benefit from promotional rates and offers. Our average deposit cost of 71 basis points increased 1 basis point from the second quarter, the lowest linked quarter increase since the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase from the second quarter was driven by continued retail deposit campaign pricing for new deposits so that we begun lower promotional rates in terms in response to market conditions. The increase was also impacted by unfavorable deposit mix shifts. On page 12, we provide details on period-end deposits which grew 3% from a year ago and 2% from the second quarter. Wholesale banking deposits were up $6.6 billion from the second quarter driven by seasonal growth in middle market and business banking as well as growth in our commercial real estate business. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $11.9 billion from the second quarter driven by higher retail banking deposits including growth in high yield savings and CDs. Wealth and investment management deposits grew as clients reallocation of cash in the higher yielding liquid alternatives slowed during the quarter. Mortgage escrow deposits grew $4.1 billion from the second quarter reflecting higher mortgage payoffs. These increases were partially offset by a $2.5 billion reduction in corporate Treasury deposits, the second consecutive quarter of declines. Net interest income declined $470 million from the second quarter primarily due to balance sheet re-pricing driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment as well as $133 million of higher MBS premium amortization costs due to higher pre-payments. We currently expect MBS premium amortization to continue to increase in the fourth quarter but at a slower pace. We also had lower variable income and smaller positive impact from hedge ineffectiveness accounting results. These declines in net interest income were partially offset by favorable balance sheet growth and mix and the benefit of one additional day of the quarter. As you can see on the chart on this page, rates have been volatile and the yield curve has flattened significantly over the past year. Net interest income was down 8% in the third quarter and down 4% in the first nine months of 2019, compared with the same periods a year ago. As we stated last month, we currently expect net interest income to decline approximately 6% for the full-year compared with 2018. As always, net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors including loan growth, pricing spreads, the level of rates and the slope of the yield curve. Turning to page 14, non-interest income increased $896 million for the second quarter driven by the gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business. Let me highlight a few of the other linked quarter trends. Trust and investment fees were down $9 million, growth and retail brokerage advisory fees, asset base fees in our asset management business and investment banking fees was offset by the decline in trust and investment fees as a result of the sale of our IRT business. While we no longer recognize trust and investment fees from this business, we will continue to administer client assets for up to 24 months, and the buyer will pay us a fee for certain costs we incurred during this transition period. This fee was $94 million in the third quarter and was recognized in other non-interest income. Mortgage banking revenue declined $292 million from the second quarter driven by a $419 million decline in servicing income primarily due to the valuation adjustments on our MSRs reflecting higher prepayment rate estimates. Partially offsetting this decline was $127 million increase in net gains on mortgage loan originations and sales activities. Mortgage originations increased $5 billion from the second quarter due to higher refi volumes from lower interest rates with refis increasing to 40% of originations in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with a $44 billion unclosed pipeline consistent with the second quarter and we currently expect fourth quarter originations to remain at a similar level to the third quarter. Residential held for sale mortgage loan originations totaled $38 billion in the third quarter and the production margin on these originations increased to 121 basis points with higher margins in both retail and correspondent channels, driven by capacity constraints. We had $956 million of net gains from equity securities in the third quarter primarily due to realized and unrealized gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships. These gains were partially offset by lower deferred comp plan investment results which are largely P&L neutral.  Turning to expenses on page 15, expenses increased from both the second quarter and a year ago, largely due to higher operating losses, primarily reflecting litigation accruals. To explain the drivers we will start on page 16. Expenses increased $1.8 billion from the second quarter driven by a $1.7 billion increase in operating losses. The increase in compensation and benefits reflected higher salaries expense primarily driven by one additional day in the quarter, a change in staffing mix and higher severance expense partially offset by lower deferred comp expense. Infrastructure expense increased due to higher equipment expense reflecting the $105 million impairment of capitalized software, predominantly in our wealth and investment management business as well as higher occupancy expense. These increases were partially offset by lower advertising and promotion, FDIC expense, as well as lower T&E expense. As we show on page 17, expenses increased $1.4 billion from a year ago, driven by $1.3 billion of higher operating losses. As we've previously discussed, investments and risk management including regulatory compliance and operational risk as well as data and technology have exceeded expectations and have offset the expense efficiency we've achieved in other areas. We currently expect our 2019 expenses to be approximately $53 billion, which is at the top end of our $52 to $53 billion target range. This excludes annual operating losses in excess of $600 million and also excludes deferred comp expense, which is largely P&L neutral and total $476 million through the first nine months of the year. Turning to our Business segments starting on page 19, community banking earnings declined $2.1 billion from the second quarter, primarily driven by higher operating losses reflecting higher litigation accruals. On page 20, we provide our community banking metrics. We have 30.2 million digital active customers in the third quarter up 4% from a year ago, including 7% growth in mobile active customers. Primary consumer checking customers grew for the eighth consecutive quarter on a year-over-year basis. Branch customer experience survey scores have increased for five consecutive quarters and reached their highest levels in more than three years in September. The continued improvement in these scores reflects the transformative change we've been making to provide a better customer experience. We've enhanced training and coaching for our team members in our branches including an increased focus on educating our customers about our industry leading digital capabilities. On slide 21, teller and ATM transactions declined 6% from a year ago reflecting continued customer migration to digital channels. We've consolidated 130 branches in the first nine months of this year, including 52 branches in the third quarter. We continue to have strong card usage with credit card purchase volume up 5% from a year ago and debit card purchase volume up 6% from a year ago. This was the eighth consecutive quarter of achieving at least 5% year-over-year growth in both debit and credit card purchase volume. Turning to page 22, wholesale banking earnings declined $145 million from the second quarter, driven by lower net interest income reflecting the impact of the lower interest rate environment. We've expanded the key metrics that we provide for this business and as you can see we grew unfunded lending commitments on both a year-over-year in linked quarter basis. We're a large processor of commercial payments as evidenced by our ACH payment and commercial card spend and we grew our year-to-date market share and investment banking driven by higher market share in loans indications. We're also a market leader in high-grade issuances. We had record volume in the third quarter commensurate with the industry with September being particularly strong and the fourth highest month on record for the industry fueled by the rally and treasuries. In general, our commercial customers continue to see moderate demand and no widespread issues related to trade uncertainty and interest rate changes. We'll continue to monitor business performance closely, but today, while our customers are cautious, the most common concern they identify their ability to hire enough qualified workers. Wealth and investment management earnings increased $678 million from the second quarter, driven by the gain on the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business. Turning to page 24, we continue to have strong credit results with our net charge-off rate declining to 27 basis points in the third quarter. All of our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios were in a net recovery position in the third quarter. Credit card net charge-offs have been relatively stable as we've been thoughtful in our efforts to generate new account growth, including the launch of our Propel American Express Card last year, and while auto and net charge-offs increased from the second quarter due to seasonality, they were down from a year ago even as we've grown originations by 45%. We're generating growth in originations, while maintaining our strong credit discipline with consistent loan de-value, payment to income, and FICO scores. Non-accrual loans declined $377 million from the second quarter with lower non-accruals in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Non-accrual loans were 58 basis points of total loans, their lowest level in over 10 years. We closely monitor our commercial portfolio for signs of weakness and credit quality indicators remains strong. Our internal credit grades are at their strongest levels in two years and since third quarter of 2017 our criticized loan balances have declined 20% with broad-based improvement across all commercial asset classes. We currently estimate that the impact of the adoption of CECL at the beginning of next year will be a reduction in our allowance of approximately $1.4 billion. Just over half of the reduction reflects the expected decrease for commercial loans given their short contractual maturities exceeding the expected incremental allowance for consumer loans that have longer or indeterminate maturities. As a reminder, we have a smaller credit card portfolio than our large bank peers which reduces the impact CECL adoption will have on our consumer loans. The remainder of the expected reduction in our allowance predominantly related to the increase in collateral value of residential mortgage loans, which were written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle. The ultimate affect of CECL will depend on the size and composition of our loan portfolio, the portfolio's credit quality and economic conditions at the time of adoption, as well as any refinements to our model's methodology and other key assumptions. Also, as the industry experiences credit cycles, we anticipate more volatility under a lifetime reserving approach versus the incurred loss approach. Turning to capital, on page 25, CET1 ratio, fully phased-in, decreased to 11.6% driven by returning $9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the third quarter. This was up 50% from the $6 billion we returned last quarter. As a reminder, similar to last year, our plan subject to market conditions and management discretion is to use approximately 65% of the gross repurchase capacity under our most recent capital plan in the second-half of 2019. In summary, while we had a number of significant items that impacted our third quarter financial results, we had strong underlying business fundamentals, including growth in loans and deposits, increased customer activity, strong credit performance, and higher capital returns. I'm optimistic that our continued efforts to transform Wells Fargo and the fundamental strengths of our franchise will continue to position us well for success. And Allen and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Allen Parker : Good morning. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Morning, as we think about what the forward curve is telling us, and obviously it's been quite a volatile outlook for the forward curve, and some of the momentum that you talked about on the growth side in lending. As we think about the 6% NII decline in 2019, given sort of the forward curve plus that momentum, how should we think about NII decline expectations for 2020? John Shrewsberry : Yes, well, it's complicated, because there's a lot of things going into it include where rates go versus what the market is suggesting, what happens with loan pricing, deposit pricing, and a variety of things, but if we, in the various scenarios that we run thinking about, let's say, the 9/30 implied forward curve, which suggests Fed funds in the 170 area, 12/31 of this year the 10-year just under 170, and then a year forward, Fed funds in the 120 area and Fed funds still in the 170 -- pardon me, 10-year still in the 170 area. That with a range of assumptions about loans and deposits probably gets us to down low-to-mid single digits in net interest income. Maybe not as much of a decline from '18 to '19, but versus a number of scenarios, but it seems to be that would seem to capture it. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question, obviously you can't speak for the new CEO. The questions that we're getting from your investor base is that they're trying to gauge how much further investment there needs to be sort of going forward. And you mentioned yourself, John, that the investments in risk compliance and data had exceeded your expectations. And again, you can't speak for Charlie, but as you think about how those investments played out relative to investments in, let's say, innovation, and as you think about where you are versus peers, is there a significant catch-up gap because you've spent a lot of those dollars on risk compliance and data, how should we think about investment spend from here? Allen Parker : Yes, so I think when Charlie arrives, we'll conduct a complete strategic review of where all the businesses stand and where we -- what our opportunities are, et cetera, including a review of how we've been investing on the risk compliance side, et cetera, and then formulate a view going forward. One thing that probably doesn't get enough focus is that a lot of the money and time that we've spent on the risk and control side of things really does enable further innovation. So, the money we spend in technology and data, for example, has huge customer impact down the road. So, there's not an either or necessarily, there's a lot of mutual benefit from running a more controlled environment. But that will be work that we all do together with Charlie after he arrives and then present conclusions at the right time. Erika Najarian : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill. Scott Siefers : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Allen Parker : Hi, Scott. Scott Siefers : John, sort of a follow-up question on costs, I guess if I look at the reiterated 2019 expense guide, it implies a pretty meaningful downdraft in costs in the 4Q, maybe if you could just take a moment to go through sort of the puts and takes and how you bring costs down in the coming quarter? And then just along the lines of costs into 2020, I know you had previously suggested that costs could be flat in 2020, is that still something you're thinking or now with Charlie coming on board, do we sort of just sort of wait till he comes on and take a look at things, and then give him complete discretion on what the cost outlook looks like? John Shrewsberry : Yes, so on the second half, I think you answered that, which is we should wait and allow him to have an input onto the composition of how we're spending money in the future. For Q4 though, as you pointed out, it does imply a step down. And I think the biggest sources of that are other professional fees and some labor-related expense. But it does require that, that\u2019s how the math works, and that's how we're forecasted right now. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect, thank you. And then just separately on mortgage, I think you had said that the originations should stay around this quarter's level into the fourth quarter. Hopefully, I heard that correctly. Maybe if you could just sort of comment on where you see gain on sale margins trending with a nice uptick this quarter? And overall, given the moving parts that you see, should we expect mortgage revenues to be at or above what we saw this quarter, particularly if we don't get the same sort of MSR noise? Allen Parker : Yes, so on the origination side, it's hard to say what the full quarter gain on sale is, but we do think it'll be in the neighborhood of where it's been recently, it was just, call it, 120 basis points, which was a big tick up and welcome. On the servicing side, well I wouldn't expect there to be any revaluation in the fourth quarter. We think we\u2019ve got that in the third quarter. We -- recall that we are in a flatter curve environment, and so the carry for holding treasuries is a hedge to the MSR. Sometimes, it works for us in a steeper curve environment, and sometimes it's either neutral or works against us when the curve gets flatter. So we shouldn't earn as much on the hedge but we probably wouldn't have the type of valuation items we saw in Q3. Scott Siefers : Okay, all right, terrific. Thank you very much for the color. Allen Parker : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Allen Parker : Hi, John. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Hey, John, wanted to ask about deposits -- deposit pricing. With the deposit cost increases slowing, might we have seen kind of the end of the deposit cost rise for you guys this quarter assuming rates stay flat to down from here, kind of just trying to think if this could be the max paying quarter for NIM where you had the deposit costs up and loan yields down, and maybe some just puts and takes for the fourth quarter on NIM versus this quarter? John Shrewsberry : Yes, so my expectation is that deposit costs will be cheaper in the fourth quarter reflecting what you described in terms of kind of the burning out of the higher cost deposits that got layered in before the Fed began to ease. Having said that, that is still -- there was less room to go down on the deposit side, and so if rates continue to move down on the asset side it still works against us even if deposit costs aren't rising. So we have to be as vigilant as we can to keep deposits costs as low as it makes sense for the businesses and customers that we serve. But even if they're not rising there's still leverage working against us in a declining rate environment. John McDonald : And in terms of good guys, bad guys, and fourth quarter versus third, what's worse and what's maybe better than what you experienced this quarter on just a NIM percentage? John Shrewsberry : Well, I think we're imagining having a little bit higher level of MBS premium amortization. So, that will be working for us in the fourth quarter. It depends, I'd say in terms of wholesale pricing, wholesale banking, deposit pricing. Working with the higher beta customers to make sure that we reduce those as quickly as possible, there is probably more room to run on that with a little bit of divestiture time that could be a benefit. The burnout of more promotional activity on the consumer side is probably a net benefit, and those are some of the bigger items. John McDonald : Okay, and guys, one more follow-up on the expenses. John Shrewsberry : Sure. John McDonald : Is it accurate for us to think that there are some elements of your inflation and expenses that are temporary, and helping you get to the best-in-class and satisfy your regulators, and then other parts that are permanent, like helping you stay best-in-class and keep satisfying regulators and some of them what you're building might get more efficient over time, and obviously a lot of it will stay? John Shrewsberry : Yes, I think it's a good point, there's a real opportunity for, for taking best-in-class and then making it much more efficient. I think we should -- maybe it was last quarter, one of the things that we mentioned is that we're building a control environment for the company as it exists today, and there is just through process consolidation and process reengineering, there's an opportunity for the company to be a whole lot more simplified as we roll forward, and both the cost of delivery and the cost of overseeing that from a risk and control perspective would be expected to be more efficient. Some of that is converting multiple manual processes to just a fewer processes, and some of it is from converting manual process to automated process, but all of that is upside from where we -- from the day that we determine that we think we've achieved the best-in-class requirement from an operational risk and compliance perspective. John McDonald : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Hey, John, one follow-up on the NII side, so you keeping their minus 6 NII I got for the year kind of gets you 11 fours for the year, and down even five next year kind of holds you at that 11 four-ish, and so I know there're so many potential permutations of what happens with the rate environment, but maybe you can just help us talk through how much you expect the balance sheet to grow then, or how -- versus how close you're starting to get towards the asset cap, and what constraints if anything, might you have as this gets further out? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : I mean within the relevant range of expectations of loan and deposit growth, I wouldn't think of the asset cap as being as really coming into play in our forecast horizon, in part, because there are plenty of levers that we can pull that don't have real customer impact in terms of consumers and our business customers, and we've talked about some of those before in terms of some of the institutional deposits that we take or other wholesale funding that we use, and then, there are some assets that don't work that hard for us from a balance sheet perspective. So, I guess the low single-digit growth rates for loans and deposits is probably a reasonable proxy for a reasonable placeholder for thinking about how 2020 unfolds, could be a range of different outcomes, but that would be consistent with what I mentioned earlier in terms of how you might forecast the different rate paths and getting to a low to mid single-digits down percentage in net interest income for 2020 versus 2019. Ken Usdin : Understood, thanks, and a follow-up on the fee side, we got the IRT coming out, did you spoke about it, was in the deck, and then you've got Estill [ph], can you just help us understand how you are thinking about how that just nets out as we get past this year as well in terms of revenue and expense trajectory? Thanks, John. John Shrewsberry : Yes, well, so with IRT, I think we actually have a -- this page in the back of the supplement that shows you exactly what to expect there, and not to oversimplify it, but it's on the order of $100 million a quarter I think from both revenue and expense, at least as we process it. Estill coming out starting in the fourth quarter, it was probably a little bit bigger in terms of dollars of revenue per quarter, and you'll see it mostly in the commercial mortgage brokerage line item in the P&L, it shows up in a couple of others areas too and have investment banking fees, but similarly the expenses approximate the revenue in our own experience. So when we finished Q4 and we talked about our 2019 expenses, and we will provide a reconciliation for people to be able to show where we ended up and we'll be sure that to call out both of those things. Actually, it won't really impact -- IRT won't impact it because the expenses are still in our run rate, and we're recovering them, Estill will be a minor adjustment, because there won't be expenses for Q4. Ken Usdin : Understood, thank you, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Allen Parker : Hi, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Staying on the loan growth topic, you saw some pretty good declines in the commercial real estate portfolios this quarter again and just want to get your updated thoughts there, that's the one area that you're expect to see some runoff still or another words lack of growth, I guess? Thanks. Allen Parker : So we had a couple quarters with small growth and then we shrunk again a little bit this quarter. As I understand it, I think our commitments for construction financing are actually up in the third quarter, which will come through as funded loans. That really is one market where there's late cycle behavior. There's lots of non-bank competitors, there are more non-bank competitors than bank competitors. And so we really have to pick our spots in order to maintain our risk reward, credit and pricing and loan terms quality, and it's also one of those areas where, frankly, your weakest loans end up getting refinanced away from you, which is also late cycle behavior by the way, so we're still very comfortable with what we have on the books, but I wouldn't look for it to grow meaningfully until the cycle turns and until our best customers have really interesting opportunities to put their own capital to work and we help them do it. So I could be wrong, but it feels to me like it's going to be treading water while our best customers either refinance deals that were already in or prudently take advantage of what the market offers them. But I don't see it as an area for outsized growth. John Pancari : Okay, that's helpful. And then separately on the fee side, the equity investment gains saw a pretty good jump in the quarter, if you could just give us a little bit of color on what drove that and if you can give us a little thoughts in your outlook there? Thanks. Allen Parker : Sure. There's a couple things that drive that, one is it's a great time to be realizing from both private equity and venture portfolios. And so, our teams have been selling into that and that's where we've been at the high point in the cycle for a while now. So with respect to the second part of your question, I expect that to reflect what kind of private market we're in and if it still is a strong and financing is accommodating it as it is today then I expect that that they'll continue to harvest and things will be good. It's a little bit harder of an environment for them to be putting capital to work because asset prices are so high. The other thing that contributes to is we had a change in accounting a year or so ago which is causing us to recognize unrealized gains where they said there's a subsequent capital raise in a private deal that causes us to have to mark up our position, and it's always been true if one of those companies goes public, but our affiliate still ends up owning shares for a period of time that we write up, we recognize the gain even though we haven't liquidated our position. So that's contributing, that will contribute to some more volatility here because that can only be one way even though it's been a benefit for the last year. John Pancari : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Allen Parker : Hi Matt. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. So it seems like the NIM percent could bottom somewhere in the 250s, and I'm just trying to get a sense of is that like a reasonable NIM when I think about your mix, right, everyone's trying to compare you to both your bigger peers and your smaller and you don't have as much credit card as some, does that hurts you, also not as much trading book as some that should help you. And then, you know, just to throw a couple of things like there's still some assets where it seems like you're over earning, like in the securities book, but there's also some deposits that you're overpaying. So what are your thoughts around, kind of, again based on some of the things that you set for 2020 in NII and thinking about just keeping rates for the four curve is like that NIM in the 250s like is that a normal NIM for you in this backdrop, or there's still some? John Shrewsberry : So we're not currently forecasting over our horizon to quite hit that level. I mean it's not that far off either of where we are today or what's likely to unfold. I agree that but while we do have some special things on the asset or the liability side. The sale of Pick-a-Pay loans they were contributing to interest income and to them is probably something that isn't going to be replicated. So I think once that fully runs through the comparison periods, I mean it's affecting them already. That's out, and I don't think there is that much more on the loan side. It's high yielding that's rolling off. On the liability side, we did mention that there are some promotional deposits and other things that are burning down because they were in place as we were on the way up in rates, and so that will be a benefit, but I don't think we get quite to 250 in our forecast horizon. A lot of things go into that, of course, and we don't manage to them. We're much more thinking about dollars of net interest income, but if that's helpful. Matt O'Connor: Okay, and I was kind of thinking 250 is broadly speaking, but that is helpful. And then just specifically like as we think about, you know, exiting fourth quarter at net interest income, you're obviously going to be caring or absorbing higher than normal bond premium amortization. So we don't want to run right all that. What is the level of the bond premium amortizationthis quarter? You said they increased at 131, but what's the run rate? John Shrewsberry : Yes, for MBS it's just under $400 million for the quarter and it was just under $250 million for the second quarter, and we think it'll be up a little bit in the fourth quarter. So it's been about $775 million year-to-date through the third quarter. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just last question all this, as we think about exiting this year, just assuming rates stay where they are now, does that go to zero or there's still going to be just some ongoing amount in the fourth quarter? John Shrewsberry : I assume there'll still be some ongoing amount, if we stay in this context for 10 year and mortgage rates with the velocity of prepayments. You heard me mentioned that we're at about 40% refis right now in our own production, and our pipeline is this big coming out of the third quarter as it was going in. And so, that may take months or even quarters for the -- in the moneyness of the outstanding stock of mortgages, you know, agency mortgages to work their way through the system, but there is a whole lot more people who are in the money for refi today than a few quarters ago. So I don't think that's going to abate quickly. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And I could just be greedy here and squeeze in one other thing. You've talked about the increased spending in regulation compliance controls related areas versus two or three years ago. Is there a dollar amount that you can provide on that increase or I think at one point you did talk about the headcount increase, maybe you could update that and we can make some estimates if you can't give us a dollar amount? Thank you. John Shrewsberry : Yes, I don't have a crisp answer for you only because it appears everywhere. It appears in the front line and appears in the second line, it appears in technology, it appears in a variety of areas. I think we'll try and put a comparison together for folks to get a picture of not only what we think about it, how we think about it historically, but how we think about it going forward back to John McDonald's question of what do we look like at the high watermark versus what efficient looks like over time. I think matching detail that people should be able to understand as that story unfolds, and I think as we finish this work that we do with Charlie and we talk about what the next steps are expense-wise, that's a reasonable expectation from our team. Matt O'Connor: Okay, thank you. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. Allen Parker : Hi, David. John Shrewsberry : Hi, David. David Long : Good morning, everyone. Looking at your securities portfolio, what type of yield do you have rolling off the securities book this quarter, and then what are you looking at for reinvestment yield? Allen Parker : Yes, I think in general we're reinvesting about 25 basis points down from what has been rolling off, and of course it depends on whether it's agency MBS, which is the bulk of our purchases. We also have some treasuries and agency debentures, and we have some structured products and other things, but on average, I think our purchases in Q3 were just North of a 3% yield and what's been rolling off from a coupon perspective has been high threes from a yield perspective has been not terribly different than 3%. So, in agency MBS in particular, I want to say that we're probably down, gosh, 25 to 25 plus basis points on a reinvestment rate basis. David Long : Okay, got it. And then the second question I have relates to the potential future litigation losses and I know in the -- in your Q, you give the number and it seems to be rising in most course. Do you have that number? What the number may be here in the as of September 30? Allen Parker : No, it'll keep -- the number will keep being refined until we file the Q, which will happen in a couple of weeks. So be on the lookout for that for the latest, which will include everything we know up until that day. David Long : Got it. Thank you for taking my questions. Allen Parker : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Hi, John. I thought let me just start with a question that either if you could respond to. So there was an issue that came up in the middle of the third quarter that the New York Times reported about accounts close that we were being charged fees after they were closed, can you give some color on this issue when it was discovered, a number of customers, what's involved? Were you on the timeline of all of this, and actually overarching why this even is coming up now? Allen Parker : Vivek, thank you for the question, I guess what I would say is that at this point, there's really not any further information that we can give you with regard to that situation. We have obviously in response to the article that appeared gone back and looked at all our account closure information and we've been working very hard. closely with our regulatory agencies ever since then, we're at the point now where we're coming to some conclusions about what happened, but it would frankly be premature at this point for me to really give you any information in that regard, and we're taking a look at what happened. We're trying to determine the veracity of what was said in the New York Times. And perhaps most important, we're trying to determine whether we ought to make any changes at all with regard to the way that we've been conducting ourselves in that arena. I wish I could be more forthcoming in terms of information, but it's still in progress, and it's been an effort in which we've been engaged very closely with our regulators. Vivek Juneja : You mean when you say conducting yourselves as in just the whole process of how it works, account closures et cetera or something else? Allen Parker : Yes, the whole process of account closures is complicated in any financial institution because there are situations where people close their accounts voluntarily, whether they call a call center or they walk into a branch, and there are also situations where accounts have to be closed for legal or regulatory reasons, and there are a variety of considerations that go into how that's done, and we're going through very carefully and looking at all those considerations and coming to the conclusion as to the changes, if any, that we ought to make with respect to the way that we've handled ourselves in the past. Vivek Juneja : Completely separate question for John. John, you mentioned about the promotional retail deposits. Are you completely stopping it? Are you just reducing the rates that you're offering by the amount of rate cuts that you've seen which is what several other players have done with their higher yield offerings? John Shrewsberry : So there always be some level of promotional activities should reflect the market conditions that we're competing in both in terms of rates and terms. I think like a lot of people and with the expectation of lower rates shortening up initial terms, so that we are not overpaying for a longer period of time, they might have previously felt like it was necessary in a rising rate environment. So we've -- there's some of it in the third quarter, we've eased off on pricing, we've eased off on terms, but just like your firm, there will always be some amount of it to make sure that we're competitive market-by-market and to test and learn. Vivek Juneja : All right. One last, if I may. You in the past have given us loans to non-depository financials outstanding. Could you give the number what that is this quarter? John Shrewsberry : Let's see. I'm looking at the papers around me here. I don't think it's changed much during the course of the quarter. Yes, I don't know. We'll follow-up with you on that. There wasn't a meaningful move in that category during the course of the quarter, but I'm not having handy. Vivek Juneja : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Compton with Morningstar. Allen Parker : Hi, Eric. Eric Compton : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So my first question is you made the comment that one of the areas of expenses that you expect to be helping you meet your full-year guidance is from that other professional fees line item, and I was just curious if you have any more color around why that might be dropping? What might be causing that, if that's related to perhaps progress on some of the risk and compliance spending and maybe taking some more or higher percentage of those activities in-house? Any more color on what's driving that? John Shrewsberry : Yes, that's a good question. So some of it is definitely having taken some of it in-house. The amount by which we're talking about it changing frankly isn't indicative of a giant pivot one way or the other; it's still a category that's too high. It represents both consulting type firms where we've been getting expertise as well as labor augmentation or staff augmentation, particularly in technology labor where we've been, we've been hiring people as contractors, where we haven't been able to hire as quickly as necessary. I think like all firms, there's a portion of our workforce in that area that is on contract. So with the shift in the fourth quarter is the current forecast just based on what's rolled on and what's rolled off and the current body of work, but there's still a lot of it going on. It's still a level that's too high, and as we roll forward and think about what efficient looks like, there's no doubt that that category coming down, substantially will be high on the list of sources in a more efficient state to be operating in. Eric Compton : Okay, that's helpful, and then one last question. I appreciate it, if you don't want to comment on this too much, but just going back to the legal reserve estimate, understanding the official number will come out in the Q, but we had that $800 million jump and now we're getting that $1.6 billion charge or the jump in the high-end of the legal reserve estimate, and now the charge in the current quarter and just the operating losses, and just curious if there's any color on, do you get a sense we're starting to get more towards the light at the end of the tunnel when it comes to this? Should we start see this, the legal reserve estimates start to trend down? Is that your sense? Just any more color around, I guess, behind the scenes, what's going on there? John Shrewsberry : As you preface to your question with we really can't provide anything in the way of color on this. As you know, we don't provide information as to the portion of our reserves that's applicable to any particular litigation or other items and with regard to the DOJ and SEC investigations that began in 2006, we really don't have any update beyond what we said in our prepared remarks and what we previously disclosed in our last quarter 10-Q, our discussions with the DOJ and SEC are ongoing and when we have more information to disclose, we'll of course do so. Eric Compton : Absolutely, you said 2006 you meant 16? John Shrewsberry : Yes, I'm sorry. There is nothing from 2006. Allen Parker : Nothing from 2006, thankfully. Eric Compton : Okay. And I appreciate it. Thanks for taking the questions. Allen Parker : Sure. And while the next one is coming back, the number is $104 billion as of September 30 for the exposure, total exposure to non-bank financials. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. So I feel like hate to beat a dead horse with the NII, but I feel like either I'm taking the guidance to literally or missing something, but the outlook is still for NII to decline 6% on the reported basis and I guess $1.8 billion decline versus the first-half, it seems to suggest that the fourth quarter NII is roughly about $11 billion and even if you do a little bit better than that, it still implies in a pretty substantial declines in NII in NIM degradation, the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and everything a lot of what you said John, in terms of less incremental headwind from premium, deposit costs maybe starting to peak out and even reduce a little bit or fall a little bit next quarter. The piece to headwind from the purchase credit impaired PCI should start to moderate just because you're selling less of it at least on a sequential basis. It seems like that the balance sheet mix and re-pricing element is pretty pronounced to get there. So I guess what am I missing and is it really just that the impact of the rate cuts, the lower long end, is that pronounced in terms of the impact on asset yield? John Shrewsberry : Well, I think at the asset side that's sort of fully reflecting re-pricing down. We talked about the deposit costs not being higher, probably being a little bit lower, and it gets you to the types of numbers that you described. Saul Martinez : Okay. John Shrewsberry : Very close. Saul Martinez : Okay, but the math is right, I guess the math is right that 6% would be in the 11 billion or so range for the fourth quarter on a reported basis? John Shrewsberry : That's right. Saul Martinez : Okay, all right. I just wanted to be clear. So wanted to just maybe ask about a different topic and I apologize I was on a little bit late at Allen if you addressed it, but any update on where you stand on the consent order and remediating the operational risks and controls, and it seems like there's a lot of blocking and tackling there in terms of all of the processes that you're looking at identifying risk and controls and were appropriate remediating those. Can you just give us a sensing on, you know, regardless of what the Fed does and when they lift it, where you feel like you are in that process and do you feel like you need to get past that before you can really attack the cost structure in a meaningful way? Allen Parker : Yes. Thanks. Let me start on that and I'll turn it out to John, I mean our conversation with our regulators are of course confidential supervisory information, but I can say that our engagement with the regulators has been very constructive and we're in constant dialogue with them on a number of fronts. As everybody recalls, several of the regulators made public statements earlier in the year in which they express their disappointment with the progress we've made up until that time. In response to that criticism, which of course we accepted over the last six months, we re-coupled our efforts with regard to trying to satisfy their expectations, and I made clear, I know Charlie will as well that the entire Wells Fargo team must continue to act assertively and decisively to meet the regulators expectations going forward. With regard to the issues raised in the Fed consent order, the feedback that we are getting from the Fed on a constant basis is enabling us to continue to make progress in terms of responding to their expectations. We're a good ways down the road, but I think it's fair to say that we have a substantial amount of additional work to do and of course at the same time we've designed and implemented and we're constantly working -- doing enhance our new risk management framework, and that's fundamentally transforming how we manage risk every day throughout the organization in a way that I would describe as much more comprehensive integrated and consistent, and at the same time, we're enhancing frontline risk, independent risk management and the audit function. So that we can ensure multiple layers of review and better visibility into issues as they emerge, and obviously the goal of all this is to prevent the occurrence of the kinds of issues that we had in the past. And as John alluded to before, we're also emphasizing operational excellence throughout the company. Our biggest focus there is on business process management in an effort to try to deliver greater consistency. So I guess what I will say, and I'll turn it over to John to talk about some of the financial impacts. There is a great deal of work to do to meet the expectations of our regulators. They're appropriately high, but we're committed to completing that work. We're working very hard and we're confident that we'll be able to complete the work in a manner that's timely and just as important up to the highest standards of professionalism and durability going forward. John Shrewsberry : Yes. And so, to the second part of your question, so we've had these efficiency programs in place for the last few years, which began before this biggest push in response to the Fed consent order and some other regulatory feedback, but through that process, we've got hundreds of programs that have gone activity-by-activity and said about taking unnecessary costs out, and then at the same time we've embarked on this getting it right from an operational risk, compliance, governance perspective, including all of the enabling technology, which is where all this money is being reinvested. So, as I mentioned earlier on this call, the big opportunity once Wells Fargo both internally and from a regulatory perspective has chin the bar for being excellent at operational risk, compliance, and governance overall like that we believe that we are in credit risk and some other areas, is a massive simplification because as we go down this business process management path, we inventory and uncover the fact that we do just about everything we do in many different ways, and there is a huge opportunity to compress that to get more consistent. It improves the customer experience, the team member experience. It's easier to control. It's easier to automate, and it's much less expensive to deliver, and I think from an investor perspective, it's important to know that we are fixing our status quo Wells Fargo the way that our individual processes have currently operate and then there is the opportunity to re-engineer. Now that may look different after we have sat down and done a complete strategic review with Charlie, but it is how the team has set about doing the business or doing the remediation that's necessary to improve the company today starting with the way things are done today, but there is from my perspective an extraordinary efficiency opportunity in modernizing that. Saul Martinez : Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Two quick questions, one just on MSR revaluation, I mean I realized that there was some pre pays in the quarter, and I know that you guys are really good estimating that. So just wondering if there was something else? Or, was it just a more violent movement expected? And is it a onetime in your opinion that it's not going to pop back up I would expect, but just wanted to get your understanding on that? John Shrewsberry : Yes. Well, it was a bigger move than was expected, and I am always -- I am reluctant to say that it could never happen again, but the way we estimate the customer response to their in the moneyness for a refinance given what we know about -- what type of cohort they are following is the basis of how we estimate that, and it happens -- it's been happening at a faster pace, and so we think we have captured that in this valuation adjustment. Betsy Graseck : Okay, and then on the auto lending side, I know you highlighted that the reconfiguration, restructuring of that business is now finish, and we saw some really strong results this quarter with originations up. What was it, 9% linked quarter? Do you feel like it's the start of the rebalancing of that auto business? Is this is a run rate that you think you can keep for the - I don't know foreseeable future? I am just trying to get a sense of the sizing of the auto book that you think you can get back to post this restructuring of that business? John Shrewsberry : Yes, my sense is that if we still liked the risk reward, so if consumer credit stays about where it is and if used car value stay about where they are, that there is an opportunity for us to grow further. So as I mentioned, the growth that we have gotten so far is really by doing more in the same upper rationale on credit tiers, and we previously ran the business with -- including little bit more in the -- at least in the non-prime category, and my sense is that we will probably begin to do that too over the course of the next couple of quarters. We are easing into it, but I don't think of this uptick as aberrant, and I think that there is more to do. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Allen Parker : Let me close our call by thanking all of you for your questions and for joining our third quarter conference call. As always, I would also like to thank all our team members for their hard work, dedication, and enthusiasm. Best regards to you all. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

It's been a busy time as I have been working to get to know the company, our opportunities and challenges and I've learned a lot. But as I discuss my observations, please recognize that it is still early days. I don't have all the answers yet, but I will share more as I learn more and as the year progresses. John is going to cover the quarter in detail in a few minutes and we'll answer your questions. You can see that a series of legacy issues meaningfully impacted our results in the quarter. Even excluding these significant items, our results are not as strong as we aspire to. But the strength of the franchise is still evident. There are certainly some areas of success but the opportunity to improve our results is significant and attainable. Let me first share some of my observations and thoughts before turning it over to John. First, I was honored to be chosen to lead Wells Fargo because I believe this is an extraordinary company that plays an important role in this country. We came out of the financial crisis as the most valuable and most respected bank in the U.S. But as you know, we made some terrible mistakes and have not effectively addressed our shortcomings. These circumstances have led to financial underperformance, but we have one of the most enviable financial services franchises in the world and employees that want to do what's necessary to again be one of the most respected and successful banks in the U.S. To fully capture this opportunity, we must have a strong foundation and move with an extreme sense of urgency to remediate our historical issues. We still have much more work to do to put these issues behind us, and our future depends on us doing this successfully so we can regain trust with all stakeholders, including our clients, regulators, lawmakers, as well as the broader American population. Ultimately, our actions will dictate when that trust is completely regained, not our words. Given the importance of these issues, I want to say a few more words about our situation, particularly about the challenges that stand in the way of our success and importantly, the different approach we're taking to address these issues. Providing an honest assessment and clear priorities is critical. And I've given a clear message inside the company that we have not yet met our own expectations or the expectations of others. We must do what's necessary to put these issues behind us. Our ability to maximize the value of this great franchise is dependent on us running the company with the highest standards of operational excellence and integrity beyond what we've done to-date. We are appropriately a highly regulated institution. And while we need to fulfill regulatory expectations, we recognize that what we want and what regulators want are not different. We are responsible for our actions and they're responsible for ensuring our actions are consistent with clearly defined standards. It's our job to run the company such that we fulfill their expectations, and those of the American public and other countries where we operate. Respect was earned in the past and we will earn it again. As such, since joining I've been spending almost all of my time on these issues. I will say this several times, but you should know there's still much work to do. Many have focused on the Fed consent order but remember we have 12 public enforcement actions that require significant resource commitment. While I certainly wish more of this work was behind us, what's required of us is clear and we will get it done. It\u2019s work that other banks have done already, so there's a clear roadmap for what we need to achieve. We're making significant changes to our management structure and processes to accomplish our work, changes that will make us more effective. Like any other problems, recognition of the importance and severity is necessary first step, but this by itself is inadequate. We will take whatever actions are necessary. Our future success depends on resolving these issues. So we will act accordingly. The management team will be judged and held accountable for resolving these issues. To set us up for success, we will ensure we have the right people in place to both resolve these issues and be the stewards of this great company. Importantly, I want to acknowledge that we have so many wonderful people at Wells Fargo that have done an amazing job serving our clients and customers in the face of the diversity for several years now. They've been through so much and have helped us sustain such a great franchise. So I do want to say thank you to them for all they've done. The warmth and support I've been greeted with, as I've discussed our shortcomings and work in front of us, tells a great deal about the character of many at the company. They understand our lack of progress makes their jobs far more difficult, and they're looking to management to do more to move the company forward. To get the work done we must ensure that we have the right team. To that end, we've made some important changes to the senior team to complement the talent that's here at Wells. Scott Powell joined us as Chief Operating Officer. When I arrived at the company, many on the senior management team made clear to me that they believed we needed stronger execution skills. After just several weeks at the company, I came to quickly agree. Scott will lead a transformation across the company where high quality execution, clear accountability and operational excellence, becomes part of our culture. Bill Daley joined as Head of Public Affairs. He is a strong and experienced voice and brings perspectives from the public sector that we in business do not generally have but are critical for us as we make decisions. Allen Parker, who served both as General Counsel and Interim CEO, announced he will be leaving Wells in March. We are well into a search for the new General Counsel and excited about the quality of the candidates we've met. Avid Modjtabai has announced that she will be retiring after 26 years at Wells Fargo in March. We will be announcing a new organizational structure for these activities shortly. Ray Fisher has also joined us to run our Card and Merchant Services Business. Our card business is important to our franchise and we have an opportunity to make it even more significant. Ray is an experienced card and Merchant Services executive who brings deep knowledge and a fresh perspective to our business. These changes are in addition to many other senior people who have joined the company over the past few years in important roles, such as Heads of Risk, HR, internal audits, and technology. These new additions complement the strong talent at the company. And I will continue to look at the structure and roles to ensure we are best positioned for success. We need and will have the best talent and strong leadership at the company. We're also introducing a new set of disciplines in how we run the company which I'm confident will improve our performance. These changes are not only structural and procedural but also cultural. To that point, parts of our culture are wonderful and it would take decades to recreate. People who work here love it. It really is like a second family. We focus on teamwork not on the individual. People want to be successful and do what's right though we recognized we've fallen short of this goal. But our lack of progress and underperformance point to shortcomings. Going forward, we will operate as one company, not a series of decentralized businesses. We will continue to foster a culture of partnership but we will move past the need for consensus and have open and direct fact-based discussions where we emerge with decisions. We will have a different level of management discipline than we've had in the past and we'll value and expect high quality execution. There will be clear responsibility and accountability. We will judge ourselves based upon our outcomes not our words. And we will ultimately judge ourselves versus the best as we believe that we should be the best. As we begun to implement this new culture, the response has been overwhelmingly supportive. But I understand it's different and is a significant change for many. We will be respectful of our past and of those who have built this great franchise, which includes so many still with the company today, but we must move forward. I'm confident these changes will be highly impactful. And though I understand you would like time frames around resolution, I cannot provide that today. Our job is to do the work that's necessary. Regulators and other stakeholders will determine when it's done to their satisfaction. My experience is that our regulators are clear, direct, tough, but fair. The work is on us at this point. Let me now turn to our medium and longer term opportunities. Our franchises are world class and are in the sweet spot of providing necessary financial services for consumers, small businesses and middle market and large corporate companies. And importantly, we play an important role in helping our customers and clients prosper, as well as being an important enabler for U.S. economic growth. While I've spoken at length of our mistakes and our commitments to fix them, the underlying franchise itself is as valuable as ever and our opportunities are greater than ever. The success of our business model is proven assuming we run the company with the appropriate controls and work as one company with the goal of delivering for all stakeholders. All of our business segments, Community Banking, Wealth Investment Management and Wholesale, have the breadth and scale that gives us significant competitive advantage and allow us to deliver truly differentiated products and experiences for our customers and clients. Our opportunity to use technology to drive both automation and new solutions will only grow in importance. Our franchises, both individually and collectively, are the envy of many. So while our resources and attention today are appropriately preoccupied with historical issues, as we move forward, we will be in a position to leverage our unique franchise and generate stronger financial results. And just to be clear, we are well aware that our expense levels are significantly too high. Part of this is driven by significant project expense related historical issues, part is due to the necessary investments in technology, part is due to significant inefficiencies that exist across the organization. But there is no reason why we shouldn't have best in class efficiency with these businesses at this scale and that ultimately will be our goal. And know we've had pockets of strong performance, we're also well aware that our rate of customer and revenue growth is too low. Given what we've been through, this isn't surprising. There's certainly an opportunity cost due to the asset gap. Management time and resources have not been as focused on growth as they otherwise would have been. And we have an opportunity to think differently with different level of rigor about how to grow the franchise. All of this points to great opportunity. So again, I know you will want to know timeframes and targets, but please understand that it's too early after less than three months at the company. That said, we have just begun the process to rethink our plans for 2020 and beyond in a different level of detail. While the opportunities for improvement are clear at the macro level, we need business-by-business plans. Accordingly, we have just begun conducting what are really both budget and broader business reviews where we look in detail at our plans. We will be reviewing over 10 businesses in detail, as well as all of our enterprise functions. As you can imagine, technology is important theme. This isn't merely a review of the numbers, but one where we use the facts to form a basis to discuss strategy and potential actions. We are asking each business leader to show us what best-in-class efficiency looks like and what our path to achieve it is. We're reviewing revenue and return performance as well and what a path to best class looks like here as well. We're discussing our competitors large and small and we're thinking through our unique options given our special franchise. These are analytical and strategic discussions that I don't think have occurred consistently across the company in some time given what's occurred. The output of this work will provide us roadmaps to not only improve our performance within each business, but also position us to understand our opportunities across the company and prioritize accordingly. First and foremost, this includes clarity around ensuring we're spending appropriately on historical issues. It's still very early in our process but I will say that every session thus far has reinforced that our opportunities are meaningful. We intend to be detailed, thoughtful and complete to do this properly and given our priorities, it will take time much of this year, to complete our work. But in the interim, we will devote all necessary resources to risk, control and spend what's necessary. We will be as diligent as ever to drive efficiencies and control expenses, and we will begin to work through the business opportunities we have in front of us. I'm confident in our ability to realize our potential, one that again puts us at the top of the respective financials intuition list with a far more efficient organization and higher revenue growth than you see today. While there is much to do and I know the path to success will be bumpy, I'm optimistic about our future and excited to be at a place with so many great people and such strong franchises doing incredibly important work. John, over to you. John Shrewsberry : Thanks Charlie. Good morning, everyone. We had a number of significant items in the fourth quarter that impacted our results, which we highlight on Page 2 of our supplement. We had $1.9 billion of operating losses, including $1.5 billion of litigation accruals for a variety of matters including previously disclosed retail sales practice matters. The litigation accruals reduced EPS by $0.33 per share and a majority of them were not tax deductible. We had a $362 million gain from the sale of our commercial real estate brokerage business, Eastdil Secured. We had $166 million of expenses related to the strategic reassessment of technology projects in Wealth and Investment Management. We had a $153 million linked-quarter decrease in low income housing tax credit investment income, reflecting a timing change of expected tax benefit recognition. We had a $134 million gain on loan sales, predominantly Junior Lien mortgages. And we had a $125 million loan loss reserve release. While our financial results in the fourth quarter were impacted by these items, as we show on Page 3, we continue to have positive business momentum with strong customer activity, which I'll highlight throughout the call. On Page 4, we summarize the full year results. Compared with 2018, revenue declined as 4% growth in non-interest income was more than offset by a 6% decline in net interest income, driven by lower interest rates. Our expenses remained too high and increased 4% from a year ago, driven by higher personnel expense, which included $981 million of higher deferred comp expense, which is P&L neutral and higher operating losses. Loans grew 1% and deposits increased 3% from a year ago. Our net charge-off rate remained near historic lows. And we returned a total of $30 billion to shareholders in 2019 through common stock dividends and net share repurchases, reducing common shares outstanding by 10%. I'll be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on Page 5 throughout the call. But I will note here that we were $20 billion below the asset cap at the end of the fourth quarter. Turning to Page 6. I will be covering the income statement drivers throughout the call. But I want to highlight that our effective income tax rate was 19.1% in the fourth quarter, which included a net discrete income tax expense of $303 million, predominantly related to the non-tax-deductible treatment of certain litigation accruals. Turning to Page 7. Average loans increased linked-quarter and year-over-year with growth in both consumer and commercial loans. Period end loans increased $9.2 billion from a year ago, even as we sold or moved to held for sale a total of $5.8 billion of consumer loans over the past year. I'll highlight the drivers of the linked-quarter growth in loans starting on Page 9. Commercial loans increased $3.4 billion from the third quarter, driven by broad-based C&I growth in corporate and investment banking. As we show on Page 10, Consumer Loans grew $4 billion from the third quarter. The first mortgage loan portfolio increased $3.2 billion from the prior quarter, driven by $17.8 billion of held for investment mortgage loan originations and the purchase of $2.3 billion of loans as a result of exercising service or cleanup calls. We're now substantially done with our cleanup call program for pre-2008 securitizations. Junior Lien mortgage loans were down $1.3 billion from the third quarter as pay downs continue to outpace new originations. Credit card loans increased $1.4 billion, primarily due to seasonality. Our auto portfolio continued to grow with balances up $1.1 billion from the third quarter. Originations were down 1% linked quarter on seasonality but increased 45% from a year ago, reflecting a renewed emphasis on growing auto loans following the restructuring of the business. Turning to deposits on Page 11. Average deposit cost increased 2% from the third quarter and 4% from a year ago. Our average deposit cost of 62 basis points increase 7 basis points from year ago, reflecting promotional pricing in retail banking for new deposits earlier in the year and the mix shift to higher costs deposit -- higher cost products across our consumer and commercial businesses. Our average deposit cost declined 9 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting lower rates in wholesale banking and WIM. We did not run any broad based retail banking marketing promotions for deposits during the fourth quarter. However, retail banking deposits increased 2 basis points due to the continued impact from previous promotional campaigns and deposit gathering strategies over the past year when interest rates were higher. While we continue to offer our customers competitive promotional savings and CD rates within our branches, retail Banking deposit costs are expected to start to decline in the first quarter as higher promotional rates expire. On Page 12, we provide details on period end deposits, which grew 3% from a year ago and 1% from the third quarter. Wholesale banking deposits were up $15.9 billion from the third quarter, driven by seasonality and growth in existing and new customer balances. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $16 billion from the third quarter, driven by higher retail banking deposits, including growth and high yield savings and interest bearing checking. Wealth and investment Management deposits grew as brokerage clients' reallocation of cash into higher yielding liquid alternatives moderated during the quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower corporate treasury and mortgage escrow deposits. Net income declined $425 million from the third quarter, primarily due to balance sheet re-pricing, driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment. $104 million of lower hedge and effectiveness accounting results, as well as $74 million of higher MBS premium amortization costs due to higher prepayment rates. We had $445 million of MBS premium amortization in the fourth quarter. And based on the current interest rate environment, we expect MBS premium amortization to be relatively stable in the first quarter and then start to decline. Although, we expect it to be higher in full year 2020 compared with full year 2019. As expected, net income was down 6% in 2019 compared with 2018. And we continue to expect net income to decline in the low to mid single digits in 2020. However, as always, net interest income will be influenced by a number of factors, including loan and deposit growth rates, pricing spreads, the level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve. Turning to Page 14. Non-interest income declined $1.7 billion from the third quarter, which included $1.1 billion gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business. Let me highlight a few of the other linked quarter trends. We completed the sale of Eastdil Secured on October 1st, resulting in $362 million gain that was reflected in other non-interest income. This sale reduced commercial real estate brokerage commissions by $168 million from the third quarter. We provide a breakout of the revenue and direct expense related to this business on Page 27 in the appendix. We're assessing all of our businesses as part of the reviews we're having since Charlie joined WellsFargo and there maybe additional pruning going forward as we assess our strategic priorities. Mortgage Banking revenues increased $317 million from the third quarter. Servicing income was up $165 million due to a negative MSR valuation adjustment in the third quarter, reflecting higher prepayment rates. Net gains on mortgage origination increased $152 million due to $4 billion increase in Residential Held for sale mortgage loan originations, while the production margin was flat at 121 basis points. Net gains on mortgage loan originations also increased from higher gains associated with exercising service or clean up calls in the fourth quarter. We expect mortgage originations to be lower in the first quarter due to normal seasonality. Net gains from equity securities were down $505 million from the third quarter as lower gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships were partially offset by $240 million increase in deferred comp plan investment results, which again are largely P&L neutral. Turning to expenses on Page 15. Our expenses were too high and becoming more efficient remains a top priority. I will explain the drivers of the linked quarter and year-over-year increases in more detail starting on Page 16. Expenses increased $415 million from the third quarter, driven by higher personnel and equipment expense. The $320 million increase in compensation and benefits was driven by $258 million of higher deferred comp plan expense. We also had higher salaries expenses, primarily due to changes in staffing mix, which was partially offset by lower FTE. As a reminder, we will have seasonally higher personnel expenses in the first quarter, reflecting incentive compensation and employee benefits expense. Infrastructure expense increased due to higher equipment expense, driven by the strategic reassessment of technology projects in WIM. Our operating losses remained elevated but were stable linked quarter. As we show on Page 17, expenses increased $2.3 billion from a year ago, driven by higher personnel expense and operating losses. Comp and benefits expense increased $1.1 billion, which included $691 million of higher deferred comp expense, as well as higher salaries expense, primarily due to staffing mix changes and annual salary increase. Running the business non-discretionary expense increased by $1.5 billion of higher operating losses, partially offset by lower core deposit and other intangibles amortization expense. On the earnings call last quarter, we said we expected our 2019 expenses to be approximately $53 billion, which was at the high end of our $52 billion to $53 billion target range. As we showed on Page 18, we came in above that as fourth quarter expenses were higher than expected, primarily in three areas. First, we had higher than forecasted outside professional services expense. These expenses were primarily related to legal, technology and risk management. Second, we had higher impairments and other right downs, including the strategic reassessment of technology projects in WIM that I previously mentioned, as well as impairments on rail cars. Finally, we had higher personnel related accruals, including severance. Turning to our business segment, starting on Page 19. Community Banking earnings declined $570 million from the third quarter, primarily driven by lower net interest income and lower net gains from equity securities. On Page 20, we provide our Community Banking metrics. We have 30.3 million digital active customers in the fourth quarter, up 4% from a year ago, including 7% growth in mobile active customers from a year ago. Primary consumer checking customers grew 2% from a year ago, the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Branch customer experience survey scores in December increased from a year ago, reflecting the fundamental changes we've made to improve the customer experience. The decline in branch customer experience survey scores from the third quarter was most likely due to changes in branch staffing levels. We're pleased that the progress we've been making to improve customer satisfaction was reflected in the J.D. Power in 2019 national banking satisfaction study released in December. Our customer satisfaction scores improved by 9 points from last year study, the largest increase among our large bank peers. Improving the customer experience across Wells Fargo remains a priority. And as part of this focus, we're implementing the net promoter system to allow even more dynamic customer feedback in benchmarking. As a result of this implementation, we'll no longer be reporting branch customer experience survey scores. However, we will continue to share key business drivers that reflect the progress we're making to improve the customer experience and to drive loyalty. Turning to Page 21. Teller and ATM transactions declined 6% from a year ago. As a result of our customers continuing to migrate to digital channels, we consolidated 174 branches in 2019. We had 5,352 branches at the end of 2019, down 12% over the past three years. We also continue to have strong card uses with linked quarter and year-over-year growth in both credit and debit card purchase volume. Turning to Page 22. Wholesale banking earnings declined $151 million from the third quarter, driven by lower revenue. We are an industry leader in businesses that support low income housing and renewable energy investments, which both generate income tax credits. These income tax benefits do not get included in revenue. So as you can see in the table on this page, we're reporting both our consistent wholesale efficiency ratio and we're also providing our efficiency ratio adjusted for income tax credits in order to make this ratio more reflective of how we evaluate the business. Wealth and Investment Management earnings declined $1 billion from the third quarter, which included $1.1 billion pretax gain from the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business. For the first time since the first quarter of 2017, WIM had linked quarter growth in average deposits, up 2% from the third quarter. And total client assets increased 10% from a year ago on higher market valuations, including 18% growth in retail brokerage advisory assets. Closed referred investment assets resulting from the partnership between WIM and Community Banking were up 18% in the fourth quarter compared with the year ago with December having over $1 billion in closed referrals our strongest month since June of 2017. Turning to Page 24. We continue to have strong credit results with 32 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Commercial losses were 16 basis points, up 5 basis points from the third quarter, driven by lower recoveries and higher losses in lease financing, primarily related to railcars. Overall credit quality indicators in our commercial portfolio remained strong with our fourth quarter internal credit grades at their strongest levels in two years. Consumer losses were 51 basis points, also up 5 basis points from the third quarter. Both of our consumer real estate portfolios were in a net recovery position in the fourth quarter. Our other consumer portfolios had slight increases in losses from the third quarter, primarily driven by seasonality. Both our credit card and auto portfolios had lower loss rates than a year ago. Non-accrual loans declined $199 million from the third quarter with lower non-accruals in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. Non-accrual loans were 56 basis points of total loans in the fourth quarter, their lowest level in over 10 years. We adopted CECL on January 1st of this year and expect to recognize $1.3 billion reduction in our allowance and a corresponding increase in retained earnings. This reduction predominantly reflects an expected $2.9 billion reduction in the allowance for commercial credit losses under CECL, reflecting shorter contractual maturities and the benign credit environment. While the allowance for consumer credit losses is expected to be $1.5 billion higher under CECL, reflecting longer or indeterminate maturities that have recoveries and collateral value predominantly related to residential mortgage loans, which have been written down significantly below current recovery value during the last credit cycle. As we've noted in prior quarters, we anticipate more volatility under CECL due to economically sensitive forecast and the impact of changes in the credit cycle. Turning to capital on Page 25. Our CET1 ratio decreased to 11.1%, driven by returning $9 billion to shareholders through common stock dividends and net share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Our ratio was still well above both the regulatory minimum of 9% and our current internal target of 10%. As a reminder, we used approximately 65% of the gross repurchase capacity under our most recent capital plan in the second half of 2019, so repurchases will be lower during the first two quarters of 2020. In summary, while we had a number of significant items that impacted our fourth quarter financial results and our expenses remain too high, we continue to have positive underlying business fundamentals, including growth in loans and deposits, increased customer activity and strong credit performance. We also had high capital returns. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to do the work necessary to transform Wells Fargo. And Charlie and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of John McDonnell with Autonomous Research. John McDonnell : Charlie, I wanted to ask you maybe for some high level takeaways on Wells Fargo's technology. Where do you see it being up to par and best-in-class and what areas do you see the technology is behind and needing more investment? Charlie Scharf : Thanks John. It's a great question. Again, I'm certainly not in a position to be definitive across the board, given how I have been spending my time. I will say that in the time that I spent with Saul Van Beurden, who is our Head of Technology at the company, we have a really clear list of the work that we have to do, to both improve the underlying infrastructure of the institution, which will benefit our ability to grow at some point, because it really contributes to our ability to servicing all of our clients across all of our different segments, as well as we possibly can. And so it's a robust list. There's a lot to do on it. And Saul clearly is working through with this team all the right prioritization and putting timeframes around it. At the same time, it's clear when I spent time with all of our folks that we are thinking about where we go next and how we use technology to create different experiences and we see it in terms of some of the things that we've done in the digital space on the consumer side. And so, again, I'm not in a position to be extremely specific business-by-business of exactly where we're positioned and how we think about it. Other than it's really clear that it has been a top priority inside the company. And certainly all the business leaders understand the importance that technology will play going forward. John McDonnell : And then I wanted to ask John Shrewsberry in terms of expenses, totally getting Charlie's point about being too early to talk about expense improvement, but when we think about the jumping off point as we put our models for 2020 expenses, John, should we think about this 53.7 adjusted expenses that you did for '19? Is that a good starting point to think about 2020 expenses? The last you kind of said you'd trying to be flat in 2020. Is that the right ballpark we should be thinking about for the adjusted number? John Shrewsberry : So early on here while we're still going through this planning process, I wouldn't expect that much to change other than the -- some of the adjustments that we all make for deferred comp, for excess operating losses et cetera. And then we'll, as this processes ensues, we will come back with some more details. John McDonnell : But for now we're kind of thinking flattish to that number, or that's the right ballpark to start off with? John Shrewsberry : I would just take it period-by-period, not that much is going to change between Q4 and Q1, the same because of the shortness of the time frame. And as we get more clarity as a result of our process, we'll provide more clarity. John McDonnell : And then just one as a quick follow up on that. In terms of the $600 million of operating losses that you talk about, it really hasn't been that in many years, it's really average. It seems like more like $2 billion a year and I know it's hard to predict. But to worry about, I was anchoring too low on that $600 million. Should we kind of budget something higher than that just as a go forward? John Shrewsberry : It's a good point. So that we originally talked about the $600 million, it reflected the $150 million per quarter of fraud related losses and other run rate operating losses without regard for what's been elevated over the last couple of years. I do think that the $600 million has probably grown to be something a little bit more like, could be $700 million or $800 million. We'll try and give better guidance to that. But the higher run rate or the higher realized rate that we've had over the last two years reflects more of a combination of episodic things that are anticipated to be to recur at the same level. And let me give you, just on your first question a little bit more clarity, because I'm reminded that the first quarter is the first quarter. I said this in my remarks. But there are seasonally elevated expenses in the first quarter that caused, that standout year-after-year as FICA resets, as retirement eligibility resets and a few other things that will cause that to stand out in any year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Charlie, to your points about just going after all the things to put the company on the right foot forward. How do you start to assess just if the right things are happening underneath? And coming back to the point just on related expenses, you've obviously had this build over time of compliance and risk and those functions. Are we even at the point yet where the hiring is done in that regard right where you're actually -- just you've got the people in place and it's more just about execution? How do you give us a sense of just kind of where you think you are on that story arc? Thanks. Charlie Scharf : Sure. So on the first question, I think when you're on the inside of the company and we're managing the work that has to get done the way that we are, we have clear reporting, we have clear goals, item by item by item. And so it's very, very easy for us to understand whether we're tracking to milestones and having reviewed the entire plan believe that those milestones will get us to eventual closure on issues. Quite honestly from the outside, you obviously don't have the ability to do that. That's not something that we can provide to you. So ultimately what you're going to have to look for are closure of these issues. And as time goes on that is what we hope to accomplish and that ultimately will be success as well. On your second question about where are we I guess in terms of the build of expenses necessary to accomplish the work. Again, I would say on that one, we can\u2019t sit here today and say I can't sit here today and say that the amount that we're spending and the people that we have is totally appropriate. And by the way, don't take that to mean it's too high. It's area-by-area. We've added a lot of resources. We need to understand whether we've added the right resources, whether we have people working together as well as we possibly can, understanding things that we've built manually to understand where we can go to automate those items, which will make us not only just far more efficient but far more effective. And so again, when I say it's really too early to be definitive about where we think about the level of expenses and what's appropriate, I put this into the same bucket. But again, I just want to be really clear about this. We don't sit here and believe that we have carte blanche to spend whatever we possibly want on any issue. We are going to spend what's necessary on these historical issues. And you should assume that we will be extremely vigilant about ensuring that we're not only thinking about our future but thinking about our shareholders in terms of where it all nets out ultimately. Ken Usdin : And just one follow up on your point that couple months in, you said you're going to look at like 10 business lines and just see where we should think about things from a bottom up. From what you at least see now, is the company what it needs to look like going forward, the company has been trimming out of some areas over the course of time? Do you think that all the businesses the company has today deserve to be inside the company from a go forward basis? Thanks. Charlie Scharf : I would say, as far as the big pieces of the company, absolutely. When we look at the benefits that our clients get from having the combination of consumer businesses, wealth businesses and wholesale businesses under one roof are significant today. And as we look to the future, we believe they should be even more significant. And so at that level, I would say, absolutely. As John did mentioned in his remarks we have been pruning. And as we go through these reviews and talk about some of the smaller things that we do, it is a good opportunity to ask do we need to continue to do all of these things, will they make a difference first to our clients and ultimately to us. And so I would expect to have some things come out of that. But I put them in the category of pruning at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : I wanted to follow up on the line of questioning, Ken just had Charlie. So it sounds like as we think about what you mentioned during your prepared remarks as you focus on remediation and investment, it sounds like you are also -- there is also room to focus on inefficiencies at the same time. In particular, a lot of your investors are pointing out that your headcount hasn't moved much over the past 10 years and your head count is similar to another peer that is producing about $40 billion more in revenue than you. So just want to -- I know that sounded more like a statement. But the question really is, is there room to also address some of the efficiencies as you think about remediation and investment? Charlie Scharf : I think, again, want I want to make sure that I was been clear about is that I think that we have -- we want to be able to think with this clean sheet as possible about how we should be spending our money. And so that goes to asking the question, are we spending appropriately on the historical issues and that number will be whatever we think it should be. Absolutely, we will focus on efficiency. And I want to give -- I haven't said this in my remarks, but it is important. It's not as if it's not something the company is focused on. And so when we look at all the additional resources that have been added to support these activities, it's very difficult for you all to see what we have gained in terms of efficiency, because you should just assume that our expenses would be substantially higher if we hadn't been generating efficiencies in the rest of the company over last several years. But having said that with fresh eyes, I get to show up and take a look and ask a whole series of questions as do some of the other new folks that have come in. And there are still big parts of the company where we are extraordinarily inefficient. And to be fair, it's not just my eyes and the new folks' eyes, but it's what the existing management team talks about as well. So we do believe there is significant opportunity. And while the first priority is fixing the issues of the past, we should be able to continue to work towards both. And I do want to throw on the last category which is important, which is we are thinking about the future. And while time and conscious are weighted more times the past -- are weighted towards the past, we're not ignoring the future. And so we do see there are opportunities, which are meaningful we want to have the latitude to think about how we can spend wisely on that. And so that's why were just being very, very careful about leading you to a specific number, because we're not sure where that all nets itself out and we want the time to be thoughtful about how to put it all together in a way that we certainly believe is the right long-term thing for the company. Again, very conscious of the fact that we're stewards of the company and their owners out there and other stakeholders that we have to answer to. Erika Najarian : And my second question is as you mentioned that you will be announcing a new org structure shortly. Does that include the hires that you highlighted during your prepared remarks or could we anticipate more changes to the operating committee from here? Charlie Scharf : I think what I said is what I said, which is Avid is retiring. She is responsible for a whole series of things from deposits to treasury services, to card, to innovation, digital marketing, a very, very wide range of things and we're actively working through what the right way to structure the company is with her retirement. And when we've completed that, we will certainly make sure that you all know about what it looks like. Erika Najarian : And just if I could squeeze in the third question, I hear you loud and clear that the closure of the issues is one way your investors and other stakeholders can measure progress at the company. As we think about the end of the year, what other measures of progress would you suggest your current and prospective shareholders could use to measure progress? Or is one year simply too short of the time given the transformation that you believe the company will go through? Charlie Scharf : I guess, let me say a couple of words and John could add anything that he'd like. Again, I think it's important, we have a lot going on and I have been here for a short time. And so we feel extremely optimistic about that medium and long-term, but we have a lot to figure out. And as I pointed out, some of it takes months and some of it will take a little bit longer than that. So I think answering the question of what that all looks like by the end of the year at this point is even premature. But just know that we're focus on outcomes here. John Shrewsberry : I think we will be talking about realized results and what drove them over the course of the year, including closure of issues to the extent that those are public items and then how we set ourselves up in our stakeholders up for what comes next. So as this process goes on and concludes and we have a better line of sight on what happens end of year next year, et cetera then we will begin to share that that will be progress. Charlie Scharf : And I just don't want to dwell on it, but I just want to be clear. I'm not suggesting year that any of these public issues will be closed this year. What I'm suggesting is that we are going to do all the work that's required. The timeframes will be driven by when we accomplish that work and when the regulators are satisfied by it. As I said, there is a great deal of it. Some have a certain level of complexity to them and we're focused on the work at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : So another question on the regulatory side, I think one of the things regulators always had said is they wanted to see a change in the culture at the bank as the sign that things are improving. I mean, is that still an outstanding item that needs to be addressed, or has it been addressed already? Charlie Scharf : Well, I think you know addressed some of this in my remarks that were prepared. And I think as an outsider coming in, I do have the opportunity to make some observations of some of the things that we do versus some of the things that I've seen that could help to make the company successful, going through issues that are somewhat like this. And so, I do think that these changes that I spoke about are important to helping us be more successful at closing these issues in a way that has eluded us at this point. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then second question just on the numbers themselves. I mean, if you look at, John, maybe on the commercial loans, you've seen decent growth now or I guess there's some growth year-over-year. And that portfolio looks, but pieces of that are coming from the non-U.S. also coming from this credit investment portfolio. Can you guys give us an update on the C&I lending side of it, what's this growth in the non-U.S., where is that coming from? And then how do you see these loan CLOs? Is that -- and what's the total of CLO exposure at this time? Charlie Scharf : So on the second part first, the total CLO exposure is about $38 billion, I think at this point, which hasn't changed much. This approach of investing in them in loan form is really just more accounting friendly approach it's the same risk reward otherwise. And so we've made the shift for part of our incremental investments. Still an asset class that we feel comfortable with the risk reward in, in spite of where we are in the cycle and for other reasons. The bulk of the C&I loan growth overall did come from commercial or corporate investment banking related activity. So some of it's in the asset backed finance area things like CLOs and then also with major corporate customers, but on probably not permanent funding, its things -- we'll fund at activity or strategic activity that ultimately would likely get taken out in the capital market subsequently. So it's not so much coming from the funded term loan segment of Commercial Banking, for example. And I wouldn't agree too much with the growth in non-U.S. loans that will ebb and flow a little bit, but it's not likely to be a big driver of loan growth one way or the other in the foreseeable future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : John, I want to ask you first, this $1.5 billion is a big number for this particular quarter. You've been addressing these issues. You can't talk specifically. But generally, was there some event what was the catalyst for all of sudden recognizing another significant or meaningful slug of onetime extraordinary costs? John Shrewsberry : Sure, I mean I can't talk too much about specific active litigation. But in general, these amounts get recorded when the items become both probable and estimable. So we've had elevated cost in this area for the last two quarters as a result of greater estimability of what outcomes might be. Marty Mosby : And then, Charlie, when you're coming over now and your statement that you went through initially kind of forwardly said we haven't addressed, or Wells Fargo hasn't addressed these issues at the pace or in the way that they should have in order to make the progress. How do you look at assessing where some of these things went wrong? I mean, again just generally and maybe not specifically. But you would have thought over these years there would have been a lot of attention and a lot of progress, and it just doesn't seem like that's been the case. So your assessment of it seems pretty critical. So I was just trying to figure out how to put some context around that? Charlie Scharf : I guess the way I would -- the way to think about it is that I have the opportunity to come in and look at where we are, my judgments are based upon where we actually are. I haven't -- I don't think there's a whole lot of value in terms of when I have to figure out how to spend my time in going back and figuring out if I was here what I might have done differently. I'm not sure I would have done anything necessarily differently. I wasn't in the seat. I don't know what the priorities were. I don't know what else was going on. That is a very, very difficult thing to do and generally something that's very, very unfair to do. So again, I think what's relevant is that I've been able to come in with this fresh set of eyes, believe that we have an opportunity to manage these blocks of work differently with both a different set of processes, some different people and a great deal of my time and attention, as well as the rest of the senior management team. And based upon the experience that I've had in executing operational things, as well as the other members of the team that we have in place now and understanding the work that we have to do, I do feel confident that we can get it done and that's been my focus. Marty Mosby : And I guess maybe a different way to think about it is when you've seen these things happened in the past. Would you counted as that maybe there is a new standard in which Wells Fargo is going to be held accountable to kind of develop toward in order to set the new standard for the industry? So in other words when the regulators get in on a bank, they've been really begin to kind of figure out where they want everybody else to kind of head to. So it's not like you just catching up with everybody else, maybe there's surpassing and creating a more forward kind of model that they're wanting to get to. So I didn't know is that or that part of it as well, or is this just still catching up with everybody else? Charlie Scharf : I think I've got a lot to do to speak on behalf of Wells Fargo. And so it certainly wouldn't be right of me to speak for regulators. But I do think that we have the opportunity to raise the standard by which we view the importance of the work, the manner in which we go about doing it and the way we hold each other accountable for getting it done. And so again that is my focus. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Speaking of things you need to do to get closure on some of these issues. I think in the past, you've talked about close to 10,000 processes. I think John mentioned high single digit thousands of processes where you're identifying individual risk controls and where needed remediating those risk and control functions. Can you just give us a sense of where you are in that process? What kind of progress you've made more recently? And I guess importantly, how is your relationship with your regulators evolving as you kind of go through this and work through a lot of these individual processes? Charlie Scharf : On the first part, so not all 9,000 plus processes are created equally. They're risk scored and/or importance scored for their impact. And we're ahead of where we anticipated being by the end of the year. I don't have the exact number in front of me. But of those that are most impactful, they will have been, as we've described, mapped risk ID'd, control ID'd, controls developed where controls didn't previously exist, testing over those controls put in place in the first half, by the end of the first half of this year, that's how that looks right now. And I think it's to the satisfaction of people who are watching us do it. Saul Martinez : And so it feels like you're making good progress on the major -- on the more significant processes. So just changing gears a little bit, you took I think $166 million charge for reassessing technology projects in Wealth and Investment Management. Can you just give a sense of what drove that decision and whether we should be thinking that there could be other IT projects with that you're looking at reassessing and cutting going forward? Charlie Scharf : So Jon Weiss has substantially reconstituted the leadership team in WIM. And they've set their strategic priorities and direction, and they are different than what had been under development in terms of the technology to support different parts of the business over the past few years, which is what resulted in the impairment to capitalize software development costs. I wouldn't anticipate seeing a lot more of that. And to be honest, we don't have an extraordinary amount of capitalized software development costs, so the risk isn't that great from an accounting perspective. Saul Martinez : If I could just squeeze one more quick one in, John, just on fees, the core fee lines, time deposit, trust card, mortgages. In general, it seems like the momentum has improved a bit in recent quarters. But can you just give us a sense -- and I'm not asking for specific guidance. But can you just talk directionally about whether there is any reason to think you can't grow from fourth quarter levels. Obviously, recognizing there's seasonality in a lot of these businesses. But is this -- are these like good core run rates to use and do you feel good about your ability to grow some of these line items? John Shrewsberry : The trust and investment fees should step off at a high level, because they price off of the opening deck, which for the S&P looks good for the coming quarter, that leverage it creates cyclicality that works for us and against us. Mortgage, as we said, is probably going to be a lighter quarter in the first quarter just because of seasonality. It was stronger in the fourth quarter than it would have seasonally been expect it to be. But the pipeline suggests that it will be somewhat smaller on the origination side in the first quarter. Card fees tick up because there's more consumer spending going on in the fourth quarter. So I'd expect that to be more seasonally appropriate in the first quarter. And then, it's hard to forecast trading activity, it certainly was stronger year-over-year in the fourth quarter because of the blood bath in the fourth quarter of 2018, but it was weaker third quarter to fourth quarter in 2019. And historically, the first quarter is a stronger quarter as a result of asset managers reallocating and people getting invested in the first quarter. So we'll see what happens there and that is tougher to predict, but those are the types of things that are likely to implement, things that are a little bit more ratable like deposit service charges or loan fees, etc., I don't think it would be much change from quarter-to-quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : John, can you share with us, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expected the net interest income to be down low to mid-single digits for 2020 over 2019. Can you compare for us, what's the driver of that vis-a-vis what drove the decline in 2019. Is it more having less higher yielding assets like to Pick-a-Pay loans on the books in 2020 or is it a margin compression issue, can you give us some color there? Charlie Scharf : So it's a handful of things. There was a bigger drop in 2019 because of I would say that, the original uptick in the premium amortization on the MBS portfolio that in, I'm not giving this to you in order of priority, but just in terms of inputs. The big leg down in LIBOR obviously had a big impact in 2019 that's expected to be a little flatter at this point as we're looking into 2020. We talked about retail deposits, pardon me, retail deposit pricing and how as rates were increasing we had put in place some promotions that have a little bit of a tail to them, that tail was fully in place during 2019 and will abate during 2020, all of those things. And it's -- but its rates right, they dropped in 2019, at least at the front end expect it to be relatively flattish in 2020. Just one quick, the number of variables and the range of potential outcomes around those variables that goes into giving the low to mid-single digits is a lot can move, as we've talked about. We were, I think we were quite close on our estimation for 2019, but we'll keep you updated as we roll along in 2020, what is looking like based on what changes. You mentioned Pick-a-Pay. I guess I should also point out that, that was on a full year basis, it's probably $400 million worth of interest income coming off of the sold Pick-a-Pay loans that's worthy of mentioned that we don't have this year. Gerard Cassidy : Could you also share with us, you pointed out that you grew the primary consumer checking account deposits 2% year-over-year, what are you using as the hook to get customers to come in. Is there some incentives, whether it's a higher upfront cash deposit or that you give them or is there gifts or how are you guys driving that growth? John Shrewsberry : So that metric is the number of accounts, not the deposits associated with the accounts which we've talked about separately. It's the branch network. It's the digital acquisition, the combination of those two things. I wouldn't say that it's specifically, there's nothing that's compelling people the offers that we use are more around dollars for additional -- capturing additional deposits from customers. But these account openings reflect the sort of everyday business model of Community Banking both in the branches and through digital activity. Gerard Cassidy : And then just real quickly, you mentioned lower gains in the quarter from your venture capital private equity area. What's left in unrealized gains in those two categories for you folks? John Shrewsberry : So unrealized gains are harder to come by these days, because we tend to realize them on a faster basis since the accounting change. I guess, now a year and a half ago, but it used to be the case that we'd have to actually realize something to recognize the benefit something have to be sold or go public in order for us to take a gain and these days even with private companies doing subsequent private capital raises. If I set a higher level of valuation, we recognize the gain from that as it goes along and so when the ultimate realization occurs that there is less of a pop because we've ratcheted up we've taken gains along the way. So that's led to more of a, call it, front-end loading over the last several quarters of benefit from that portfolio and it will increase the volatility if people have down capital raise rounds or things don't go as well when companies are actually sold or taken public. So it's been a great business, the returns are solid. But the accounting change has caused being revenue recognition to be a little bit more choppy. Although in the early quarters, it's actually been very strong. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : I was hoping to try to drill down into the cost side once again. I guess if you're looking at an uptick in core expenses in the first quarter, it implies a pretty substantial downdraft through the remainder of the year just to keep us in the ballpark of this year's adjusted $53.7 billion. I mean did the plan, indeed, call for such an absolute improvement in costs and what sort of the path to get there, especially at a time when there is so much discussion on investments, just curious to your thoughts there. John Shrewsberry : So we're not going to be that specific about the year as a whole. My comment earlier about the first quarter is like every first quarter, it tends to be the high tech for expenses because of the way personnel costs have first quarter uptick. And so, like any other year on an adjusted basis, you'd expect them to be higher in the first quarter and gravitate down over the course of the year, as Charlie mentioned, we're going through a second look at our planning process for the year. And so there is no fixed number at this point to. Since we are in the first quarter -- since this happens every first quarter, I'm calling out the fact that those personnel costs will be higher, there won't be much more specificity around that until we've completed this process and made some conclusions, made some choices and come back and update people later in the year. Scott Siefers : So even though I guess, the $53.7 billion is a sort of place to start -- it's not -- we shouldn't anticipate any sort of a flat trend or anything. It's basically TBD completely on what the expectations for the full year, is that correct? John Shrewsberry : I think that's appropriate, so that we don't mislead you. Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Just wanted to understand on the planning process that Charlie announced at the beginning, I know Charlie, you're not talking about time frames. But you've seen a lot of different types of institutions and a lot of different types of scenarios, and I'm wondering is this something that we should consider is, I get to best in class on a three to five-year time frame, or is this more of a one to three, just trying to understand broad strokes your thought process there? Charlie Scharf : I wish I could answer the question at this point, but for all the reasons that I've spoken about, I'm not in a position to do that. I don't want to be repetitive, so I apologize, but we've got to do the work to understand whether we're appropriately resourced against the historical activities. And then honestly, as we go through these discussions in terms of how you get to best-in-class. I'm sure business-by-business will be very, very different in terms of what the time frame is. Some of them will be structural. Some of them will require some significant technology investment. Others could be burdened by just inefficiencies that we can get to quicker. So I'm not trying to be evasive. I can see there being several different answers when we look at different parts of the Company. It's what it will actually look like when we're done with the work. Betsy Graseck : And does the work potentially have a result of exiting some of the businesses or do you think that that's really not on the table at this stage? Charlie Scharf : Well, I think I'll repeat what I said before, Betsy, I think that when you look at our big business segments, there is tremendous sense because of the benefits our customers and clients get from them being under one roof. But like any other company, we should sit and ask the question, do we need to be doing absolutely everything and we have been pruning along the way. And there's probably still some more pruning that we should probably do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So John, I was hoping to drill into some of the fee trends that you had spoken to in response to an earlier question, certainly appreciate the detail you guys gave in Slide 27, helping us isolate some of the impacts from gains and other related sale impacts. As we think about trying to evaluate the core fee income generation power just of the franchise today, after adjusting for some of these sales. If I look at that $8.7 billion you guys produced this quarter, I adjust for about $600 million that you guys cited in the slide. And then on top of that adjust for deferred comp other investment income adjustments, we get to a run rate of roughly $8 billion a quarter in core fee income generation. I know you're going to have equity market tailwinds just from what happened in the fourth quarter as we enter the year in 2020, but I'm just hoping if you could frame whether that $32 billion annualized run rate is a reasonable jumping-off point after adjusting for some of those factors or anything else that you would cite for that matter? John Shrewsberry : Well, so it's not unreasonable in the sense that it captures the seasonal volatility of some of these things that tend to ebb and flow throughout the course of the year and if we've adjusted out things that we've sold in both from a gain perspective as well as the run rate perspective and it captures that where we do have elements as you'll note that ebb and flow relatively meaningfully from not just from quarter-to-quarter but from year-to-year. And so we have had equity market tailwinds as you mentioned that we might continue to but that will come and go. I think sort of tend to look at a slightly longer time horizon on some of those line items and think about what the average has been over five quarters or so since we reported in five quarters, it's easy enough to. There's nothing unreasonable about that approach. There are some of these that we believe that even while we're doing our work we should be driving and growing and then some that will reflect the cycle of the market that we're in mortgage comes to mind in terms of where we are in the rate cycle and things like that. Steven Chubak : And just one more follow-up for me, I just wanted to clarify some of your capital guidance. So I know that the last update that I can recall and I'm sorry if this is wrong or misguided you alluded to attending 10.25% to 10.5% CET1 target that you guys were managing to that always felt quite conservative. And in the earnings release, you actually referred to an internal target of 10%. I'm just wondering as we think about future buybacks in capital return plans. Has there been any change in the firm's internal capital targets that you guys are ultimately managing to or how are you guys trying to think about that as you start to implement some of these changes that Charlie was speaking to earlier? John Shrewsberry : What we've been waiting for specifically our internal guideline is 10% and that includes the buffer on top of the 9% regulatory requirement. We've been talking about something that could be 10.25% to 10.5% waiting for what CECL looks like in stress and what the stress capital buffer guidelines actually look like once they are implemented and it's a belief certainly because we are getting more CCAR clarity over the coming weeks that will start to know whether we're going to know the hit through to that this year. And then it's likely that the combination of those two things leads us to a slightly higher level could be conservative, but we'll know for sure once we are operating in the stress capital buffer world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: I'm sure you're a little tired of all expense questions kind of near term. I do want to ask though longer term on costs. Charlie, you said about being best-in-class efficiency and I guess, just how do you define that and I think a lot of investors and analysts think of your direct peers is being like Bank of America, JPMorgan, maybe U.S. Bank as well, but are you kind of being literal like your efficiency ratio, it should be in the ballpark or better than theirs. And if it is, it's just a -- it's a bold comment given where you are coming from and obviously reflects, I assume optimism on both cost and revenue, but maybe you could just elaborate on some of those themes. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : We're going business by business and selecting the peer group that best represents either the products or the segments that had established what best-in-class looks like. So it could be the component pieces of our larger peers. It could be the component pieces of regional banks and it could be the component on what the business is. And then for the Company as a whole, the weighted average -- the mix adjusted average of what those inputs are results in the outcome. That's part of this review process that Charlie had alluded to earlier, and it's definitely aspirational as we sit here today, but that is the direction that we are setting for ourselves as Charlie mentioned for every business that we're likely to be in over the long term. We've got all of the benefits of scale working for us. It's very mature in most of them and we should -- there may be specific reasons and we will address them if we find them why we can't compete effectively with the most efficient, but that's what we're setting our sights for. Matt O'Connor: And then without putting any specific numbers around it like as you think about improving efficiency, there are comments as it could be both kind of revenue and expenses, should we think about it being somewhat balanced or the vast majority coming from expenses or too early to know right now? John Shrewsberry : Too early to know. We know there's work to do on expenses, but it's too early to start attributing percentage driver for example. Charlie Scharf : Matt, it's Charlie. Let me just add one thing because I do think it's important. This isn't something that I would say that John and I sit here in a room and believe and then we get in a room with others and they argue with us. There is a clear understanding from our business leaders that this opportunity exists. And I would say quite frankly, there is very little conversation internally about the need to use revenue to improve the efficiency rate because we do understand that there are series of things that we do that are highly inefficient. That's not to say to get the best-in-class that we won't need some revenue growth to get there, but I just find it very encouraging the way people internally are thinking about it and what they're talking about as the types of things that'll be in the line of sight. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. John Pancari : On the spread income guidance of down low to mid-single digits, I know you reiterated that, but you also indicated that you are still pruning. Does that guidance factor-in the pruning and accordingly any additional adjustments to your business base would not be all that meaningful to impact that guidance or would that guidance change if you did continue to prune? John Shrewsberry : If we continue to prune in ways that caused us to shed either loans or deposits then we would adjust the guidance. It contemplates the company as it exists today. John Pancari : And then in terms of CECL day two impact. I just want to get your thoughts on the appetite to lend in certain longer duration consumer areas. Has that been impacted at all by the implications of the new methodology? John Shrewsberry : We've done the work product-by-product to consider what the return characteristics are. And at this point, it's not likely that we change our appetite for longer duration consumer loans, it's depending on where you are in the cycle, it can cause you to think differently about what your returns are, but it hasn't closed anything to drop below a hurdle level that says to us, we need to either meaningfully reprice it or where we think whether we're there in the business. John Pancari : And then lastly, just back to the expense expectations. Again, I know it's too early to give a more accurate expense expectation, but I know you're going through your planning process, so what's the timing, when should we think we will get a more precise expectation when it comes to full year expenses, Charlie? Charlie Scharf : I guess there is nothing more that I can say that I haven't already said. I think what I've said is that we've got this process to go through. There is a lot to do and when we know something we'll tell you. I wish I could be more specific, I really do, but we have a lot to do to get to but we think the right answer should be. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Charlie Scharf : All right. Listen, thank you very much for your patience and joining us this morning. I do hope that you just walk away with just a couple of important thoughts. We have work to do. It's clear what we have to do. We're committed to getting it done, and we will get it done. The quality of the franchise is still extraordinary. We have thousands and thousands of dedicated people across the Company that can come in every day to serve their clients. They are doing an extraordinary job, and we're going to do our part to help them do their job even better as time goes on, and we think our future is very bright. And so, we appreciate, again, the patients that you have and look forward to have more conversations in the future. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Katherine. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplements are available on our Web site at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site. I will now turn the call over to Charlie Scharf. Charlie Scharf : Good morning, I'm going to open the call with comments on the current environment, the actions we're taking, our business performance and ongoing work to transform the company. Then John will provide more details on the first quarter results before we take your questions. Let me start with some remarks about the current environment. I first want to start by saying that our thoughts are with those directly impacted by COVID-19. This includes those who have contracted the virus, healthcare workers who are on the frontlines helping those directly impacted and all of those who provide essential services to ensure the country continues to function. As difficult as this is, the response by government, companies and individuals has been extraordinary. We understand that Wells Fargo plays an important role in providing stability to the financial system and the economy more broadly. And while there is still much to do, I'm incredibly proud of the efforts across the entire company, particularly those on the front lines. Let me start by discussing what Wells Fargo has done. First, I'll start with our customers. We've been aggressive in our actions to ensure we can best serve customers while also prioritizing employee and customer safety. First, on access, we've temporarily closed approximately 1,400 branches, which is about one fourth of our network nationwide, choosing locations to close based on the historical branch traffic and the physical design of each branch that would allow appropriate social distancing. Consumer and small business contact centers remain open in all other US locations to serve our customers. The wait times are higher. And we've deployed social distancing and safety measures in all sites to ensure we keep our employees safe. We've been rapidly expanding digital access and deploying new tools, including air limits for mobile deposits and wires, new digital mortgage deferment tools, and expanded e-signature support. Customers are adopting these new tools as demonstrated by a 52% increase in dollar volume of mobile deposits in March 2020 versus March 2019. We're providing significant credit to our clients. In the month of March alone, our commercial customers utilized over $80 billion of their loan commitments, and we're providing accommodations for clients in need. Through April 10, we helped more than 1.3 million consumers and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees. We deferred over 1 million payments representing almost $2.8 billion of principal and interest payments and provided over 900,000 fee waivers exceeding $30 million. We've suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions and involuntary auto repossessions. And we continue to work with HUD, the GSCs, our trade groups, others in the industry, as well as government officials and not-for-profits to identify other ways to assist customers facing financial challenges in the current environment. We've expanded our participation in the PPP program and hope to revive significant relief for our small business customers. We're quickly wrapping up our processing capacity to respond to the significant demand we've seen. Through April 10, we've received more than 370,000 indications of interest from our customers. We're working with industry groups and the US Treasury in preparation to distribute millions of economic impact payments to Americans as quickly as possible. For those that receive checks, we've implemented changes to our ATMs and mobile app to make it more convenient to use those depository options instead of going into a branch. Now turning to how we're operating the company and our employees, we have enabled approximately 180,000 employees to work remotely. For jobs that cannot be done from home, in addition to modifying branch formats, we've taken significant actions to ensure safety, including enhancing social distancing measures, staggering staff and shifts and implementing an enhanced cleaning program. We continue to pay all employees. We made a onetime cash award to approximately 165,000 employees who make less than $100,000. Additionally, as a way of recognizing the unique contributions of our employees that work on the frontline, we're making additional payments to those employees. We've made changes to our benefit plan to support those who are being tested or those who have the virus. To assist our employees who need child care, we granted eligible employees up to five paid business days off, so they can find childcare. We're also providing financial support to eligible employees for those seeking childcare through their own personal networks. And we made a $10 million grant to the WE Care Employee Relief Fund, which is available to employees affected by Coronavirus, especially those with limited resources to help them get back on their feet with basic necessities. And we're supporting our communities by directing $175 million in charitable donations from the Wells Fargo Foundation to help address food, shelter, small business and housing stability, as well as providing help to public health organizations fighting to contain the spread of COVID-19. Turning to what we've seen over the last month in the markets, as you all know, the health crisis has had a swift and severe impact on the financial markets. But the banks including Wells Fargo are financially strong and they've done a great job as many other industries have in providing continued service while many of our employees have been unable to access their offices. We also have navigated huge disruptions we saw in liquidity in most asset classes for several weeks. HQLA bid ask spreads, daily volatility and credit spreads increased 100% to 500%, versus normalized levels prior to the crisis. Activity remain reasonably order in HQLA, other loss, remote credit assets and high quality corporate primary issuance, but most other markets saw forced selling, high intraday volatility and bid asks widening meaningfully. Fed programs designed to support smooth market functioning and effective transmission of monetary policy immediately improved risk pricing, increased dealer balance sheet capacity, decreased market volatility and lower transaction costs. Large scale asset purchases in treasuries and agency MBS, improved secondary trading flows in HQLA while credit sensitive assets lagged the recovery. All of this, as well as the effect of shutdown the economy directly impacted our results. Turning to the quarter, you can see that results were materially impacted by loan loss reserves, impairment of securities and redemption of deferred securities. Our results included a reserve build of $3.1 billion for loans and debt securities, 950 million of securities impairment predominantly related to equity securities and a negative $0.06 impact related to the redemption of our Series K Preferred Stock. Within our community bank, as would be expected branch traffic significantly slowed as March progressed. We've had approximately half the teller volume at the end of March compared with the same period a year ago. ATM transactions were also down significantly, down approximately 17% in March compared to a year ago. On the lending side, we originated $48 billion of residential mortgage loans, 52% for refinancing. Auto originations declined 5% from the fourth quarter with strong originations early in the quarter more than offset by a slowdown in March. Credit Card purchase volume is down 30% from the fourth quarter and down 1% from a year ago. A strong volume early in the quarter was more than offset by declines in March. Within wealth and investment management, period and deposit balances increased 30% during the quarter driven by higher retail brokerage sweeps, reflecting higher client cash allocations. Retail broker transaction revenue increased 12% from the prior quarter. And despite market declines Wells Fargo Asset Management AUM still grew 2% during the quarter driven by strong inflows into money market funds. I'll turn to our wholesale businesses now. In trading markets businesses were up nicely year-over-year in the first two months of the quarter, but performance was mixed in March. We had strong performance in macro trading, as well as in equities due to volatility and increased flows. However, our performance in spread products suffered due to the market dislocation. Commercial loans grew $52 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter, and overall global debt capital markets activity was the strongest on record driven by high grade offerings from US issuers whose volumes were up 63% compared to a year ago. Wells Fargo's high grade debt capital markets lead table rankings improved from fourth to third with 9.2% fee based market share during the quarter. While focused on our efforts around COVID. We continue to make significant changes inside the company. We continue to add talent to the senior leadership team. Ellen Patterson joined us several weeks ago as our General Counsel and we expect several more additions to the team in the coming quarter. Even with the significant amount of time being devoted to our COVID response, we're not reducing our efforts on our regulatory commitments, and we continue to move forward on improving the processes structure and cultural change necessary to get the work done. As a reminder, during the quarter, we announced new organizational structure with five lines of business reporting directly to me. I've also spoken of our business reviews we've had put in place; those agendas have changed and are now oriented towards issues related to operating in the current stressed environment. As we settle into this environment and have some line of sight to the recovery. We will reengage with the work I discussed last quarter, and return to the asset cap now. John will provide more details on how we're managing in this environment given the constraints, but here are some highlights. We're focused on doing all we can for our clients, while satisfying the requirements and to do this, we make decisions each day on balance sheet allocation. As a reminder, the asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis and must be below $1.952 trillion at the end of the quarter. On March 31, that calculation was an estimated $1.943 trillion. In mid-March as the crisis began to evolve, we first saw slow increases in deposits and draw downs in committed lending facilities and both of those accelerated as the crisis deepens. At the end of the quarter, we had 1.981 trillion in assets. John will discuss this in more detail, but we're taking a number of actions to ensure we stay below the cap. We started the quarter with a strong capital position, including a CET1 ratio of 11.1%. With the strong growth in assets during the quarter, materially wider spreads, as well as lower earnings our CET1 ratio declined to 10.7% still above the regulatory minimum of 9% and our current internal target of 10%. As you know, we suspended our share buyback as we focused on helping our customers get through these challenging times. I'm sure you still you will want to discuss our capital plans going forward. But as you know, we submitted our 2020 capital plan earlier this month, and the results will be published by the Federal Reserve Board in June. As I think about what the future holds, here are a few thoughts. We've entered into a world we haven't seen before. Much of the economy is essentially closed. Consumer spend is down over 25% year-over-year this past week with food and drug increasing and other spend down significantly. New auto sales in the month of March were down at 32%, in February manufacturing has turned downward with ISM March reading a 49.1% as businesses cut back on orders, commodity prices are down 24%, speaking to the weakness in global demand. Unemployment is growing beyond what we've traditionally modeled. And while there is hope that this is time bound by shelter in place orders, we don't know what the timeframe is or how quickly the economy will recover when these borders are lifted. What we do know is the contraction is real, and we must do all we can to be safe, and to ensure we do our part to help recover as quickly as possible. It's equally important to note, the response is also beyond what we've historically seen. Banks have provided significant amounts of credit liquidity, banks have deferred payments on loans waived fees, made numerous other accommodations for customers in need. The response from the Federal Reserve has been fast, comprehensive in scope and significant in size. And the response of Congress has been equally impressive, and their actions are just beginning to provide the support necessary for many, but will implode quickly. The question remains what this means for our future. What's important is controlling the spread of the virus so the economy can reopen. We're hopeful that our actions, those of others and especially government support should provide needed relief and help many customers reach this difficult period. But the length of the shutdown will ultimately determine the severity. But we do notice our strong levels of capital and liquidity position enable us to support our customers and the broader US economy. We will be closely evaluating our assumptions regarding our allowance for credit losses as we move forward. And the actual level of losses we incur will be driven by how long this period lasts, and the effectiveness of the support in government and private industry. Sitting here today, there are many unknowns, and the year will look quite different than we expected the last time we spoke. But as I said, we're focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get through these unprecedented times. And we remain committed to the financial and performance improvements we've discussed as we get beyond this crisis. Thanks again to all my partners at Wells Fargo. They've been working tirelessly, and I'll pass it on to john. John Shrewsberry : Thanks, Charlie and good morning everyone. Charlie covered the information provided in the initial pages of the supplement related to the actions we're taking to support our customers, employees and communities during the pandemic. So I'm going to start on Page 6. As we highlight on this page, we had a number of significant items in the first quarter that impacted our results. We had $4 billion of provision expense for credit losses, reflecting the expected impact these unprecedented times could have on our customer's creditworthiness. We had $950 million of securities impairment, predominantly related to equity securities reflecting lower market valuations. While deferred compensation plan investment results did not meaningfully impact the bottom line, they increased net losses from equity securities by $621 million and reduced employee benefits expense by $598 million. We had $464 million of operating losses which were down $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter that included elevated litigation accruals. We had a $463 million gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans which had previously been designated as held for sale. Mortgage banking income declined $404 million from the fourth quarter driven by mark-to-market losses on loans held for sale and higher MSR asset valuation losses as a result of assumption updates primarily prepayment estimates. Finally, we redeemed our Series K Preferred Stock, which reduced EPS by $0.06 per share as a result of the elimination of the purchase accounting discount recorded on these shares at the time with the Wachovia acquisition. Even after factoring in the COVID-19 related impacts experienced during the first quarter, as we highlight on Page 7, our CET1 ratio remained 170 basis points above the regulatory minimum and our LCR ratio was 21% above the regulatory minimum. These surpluses are noteworthy given the regulatory minimums they're based upon are established to ensure financial institutions maintain sufficient resources to withstand severely adverse economic end market conditions. Turning to Page 8, I'll be covering the income statement drivers throughout the call, but I wanted to highlight that our effective income tax rate was 19.5% in the first quarter, and included net discrete income tax expense of $141 million. I'll be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on Page 9 throughout the call, but I will note here that the economic environment our customers are facing due to COVID-19 caused our balance sheet to expand as loan demand and deposit inflows increased significantly late in the first quarter. On Page 10, we highlight how we're helping our customers while managing under the asset cap that's been in place since early 2018. Driven by strong loan demand \u2013 loan growth in March, our total assets grew $53.8 billion from year end to $1.981 trillion. As Charlie highlighted even with this growth, we continue to operate in compliance with the asset cap of $1.952 trillion, as compliance is measured at each quarter end based on the two-quarter daily average. As of March 31, the two-quarter daily average for our assets was $1.943 trillion. During these challenging times, we expect load and deposit growth could continue, but cannot provide guidance on the level of growth and we're actively working to create balance sheet capacity to help our customers. It's worth noting that the high rate of growth in line utilization by our commercial clients is backed off since credit markets have reopened. We appreciate the targeted action that Federal Reserve took last week which will provide additional flexibility for us to make small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection program and the forthcoming Main Street Business Lending program. We have and will continue to take actions to manage the size of our balance sheet. For example, we've exited correspondent non-conforming mortgage originations which gives us the ability to better meet the mortgage financing needs of our existing customers. And similar to the actions we took in early 2018, we're reducing low liquidity value deposits, particularly deposits from other financial institutions. And we've also reduced our securities finance footprint. Let's look at the drivers with the balance sheet growth we had in the first quarter starting with average loans on Page 11. Average loans increased $8.5 billion from the fourth quarter driven by commercial loans. Given the significant growth that occurred late in the quarter related to a change in borrowing behavior caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm going to spend more time describing period end trends starting on Page 12. Period-end loans increased $61.6 billion or 6% from a year ago, and $47.6 billion or 5% from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans grew $52 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter as balance sheet declines earlier in the first quarter were more than offset by strong growth late in the quarter. The growth in commercial loans in the first quarter included more than $80 billion in borrower draw activity in the month of March on commercial banking and corporate investment banking loans. Revolving loan utilization and wholesale banking was 48.6% in March, up 860 basis points from December. And as I mentioned, during the first two weeks of April, we've seen these draws slow. Consumer loans were down $4.4 billion, or 1% from the fourth quarter as declines in credit card loans, consumer real estate loans and other revolving loans were partially offset by growth in auto loans. I highlight the drivers of the linked quarter trends in more detail starting on Page 13. The first mortgage loan portfolio decreased $927 million from the prior quarter as refinancing lead pay downs more than offset $14.3 billion of held for investment mortgage loan originations. Junior lien mortgage loans were down $982 million from the fourth quarter as continued pay downs more than offset new originations and $1.8 billion of draws on existing lines, which was up meaningfully late in the first quarter. Credit card loans declined $2.4 billion from the fourth quarter driven by seasonality and fewer new account openings. Our auto portfolio continued to grow, while we maintained our credit discipline with balances of $695 million from the fourth quarter. However, as Charlie highlighted, originations declined 5% from the fourth quarter with strong originations in the first quarter \u2013 early in the first quarter more than offset by a slowdown in March due to the pandemic. Turning to commercial loans on Page 14, C&I loans were up $50.9 billion from the fourth quarter with broad based growth across business lines, largely driven by draws of revolving lines of clients reacting to the economic slowdown associated with a pandemic. Commercial real estate loans were up 1.8 billion from the fourth quarter, with growth in both CRE mortgage and construction loans. Given the focus on commercial loan draws and exposure to industries that have been particularly hard hit as a result of the pandemic, we're providing more details on certain of our industry exposures starting on Page 15. We typically disclose the industry breakdown of our C&I and lease financing portfolio in our quarterly SEC filings, but are also providing the industry breakdown of our total commitments on this slide. I'd note that not all unfunded loan commitments are unilaterally exercisable by borrowers. For example, certain revolvers contain features that require the customer to post additional collateral in order to access the full amount of the commitment. While many areas of the economy are being impacted by pandemic, the next few slides provide details on the industries with escalated monitoring. Starting with oil and gas on Page 16, as far as 31, we had $14.3 billion of loans outstanding to the oil and gas industry. The size of our portfolio was down 20% from $17.8 billion in the first quarter of 2016, which was also when oil prices were low. As of the end of the first quarter, 47% of our portfolio were loans to the exploration and production sector, 41% to midstream and 12% to services. I'll provide more detail on the performance of this portfolio later on the call. We had $27.8 billion of retail loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, which included $5.8 billion to restaurants. This includes $3.9 billion to limited service restaurants commonly referred to as fast food restaurants, typically with a drive-through, which have largely remained open across the country while other restaurant formats have been more impacted with service limited to delivery or pickup. Turning to the entertainment and recreation industry on Slide 17, we had a total of $16.2 billion of loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, with less than 1% to cruise lines. We had $11.9 billion of loans outstanding to the transportation industry as of March 31, which included $2.4 billion to air transportation. We're closely monitoring our commercial real estate portfolio, which we highlight on Slide 18. At the end of the first quarter, we had $14.1 billion of loans outstanding to retail excluding shopping centers, within the commercial real estate mortgage portfolio and $10.6 billion in loans outstanding for the hotel, motel industry. Within our $20.8 billion construction portfolio, we had $7.1 billion of loans outstanding in apartments. Turning to deposits on Page 19, average deposits increased 6% from a year ago and 1% from the fourth quarter. Typically we experienced linked quarter seasonal declines in the average deposits in our wholesale banking and WIM businesses, but all of our deposit gathering businesses grew in the first quarter. This growth included the late quarter impacts of flight to quality deposits across all business lines following the emergence of COVID-19 as well as the inflow of deposits associated with corporate and commercial loan draws. Our average deposit costs declined to 10 basis points from the fourth quarter with declines across all of our lines of business. We had largely declines in wholesale banking and WIM while our retail banking deposit costs declined at a slower pace, since they were lower to begin with and continue to be impacted from promotional pricing in early 2019, most of which will expire in the second quarter. On Page 20, we provide details on period-end deposits, which better reflect the strong growth we had at the end of the first quarter, with total deposits up $53.9 billion, or 4% from year end. Also, banking deposits were up $13.5 billion from the fourth quarter driven by commercial banking and commercial real estate revolving line draws, partially offset by lower financial institutions deposits, reflecting actions taken to manage the asset cap. Consumer and small business banking deposits increased $41.1 billion, or 5% from the fourth quarter, including higher retail banking deposits largely driven by growth in high yield savings and interest bearing checking. Wealth and investment management deposit growth was driven by higher cash balances from brokerage clients. Net interest income increased $112 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting $356 million higher hedge ineffectiveness accounting results attributable to the level of market rates and differences in basis in notional and swaps hedging our long term debt. $84 million of lower MBS premium amortization resulting from lower realized prepays partially offset by balance sheet re-pricing, including the impact of lower interest rate environment as our assets re-priced down faster than our liabilities and from one fewer day of the quarter. The low rate environment could continue to put pressure on our net interest income, but we're managing our interest rate exposure to minimize the impact as much as possible. Given the current market volatility and uncertainty, we're withdrawing our prior 2020 net interest income guidance. While, we're currently not providing guidance on our expectations for net interest income for this year, we will provide more insights regarding developments throughout the year. Turning to Page 22, noninterest income declines $2.3 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by a $1.9 billion decline in net gains from equity securities, and $404 million of lower mortgage banking income. Let me explain these declines in more detail starting with mortgage banking. Lower mortgage banking income reflected unrealized losses of approximately $143 million on residential loans, and $62 million on commercial loans held for sale due to illiquid market conditions and a widening of credit spreads. This impact is recorded in net gain on mortgage loan originations and the $143 million loss reduced the production margin we report on residential held for sale originations. Absent this impact, our production margin would have increased as origination demand exceeded capacity during the first quarter. Mortgage banking results also reflected $192 million of higher losses on the valuation of our MSR asset as a result of assumption updates primarily prepayment estimates. I would note that we ended the first quarter with a $62 billion mortgage loan application pipeline which was up $29 billion or 80% from the fourth quarter. We provide details on the net losses from equity securities on Page 23. We had $1.4 billion of net losses from equity securities in the quarter, which included $621 million of largely P&L neutral comp plan investment losses. Net losses from equity securities also included $935 million of impairments, reflecting lower market valuation. The impairments on venture capital, private equity and certain wholesale businesses represented 17% of the carrying values of these businesses\u2019 portfolio investments subject to the impairment assessment. Turning to expenses on Page 24, our expenses declined $2.6 billion from fourth quarter. Operating losses declined $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter, which included elevated litigation accruals. Personnel expense, which is typically seasonally elevated in the first quarter, declined $494 million from the fourth quarter driven by lower employee benefits expense. The decline and employee benefits expense was driven by $861 million of lower deferred comp expense, which is partially offset by $544 million of seasonally higher payroll taxes and 401(k) matching expenses. We also had lower expenses in a variety of other areas including commission and incentive comp, outside professional services, technology and equipment and as you would expect, travel and entertainment. The enhanced benefits and payments we provided to employees in March, as part of our response to COVID-19 did not meaningfully impact our expenses in the first quarter. But we currently expect that they will have a greater impact beginning in the second quarter and through the remainder of this year. While these costs will add to our expense base, the actions we took were the right thing to do to support for employees. Before discussing our business segments, starting on Page 25, I want to note that as a result of the new flatter organizational structure that was announced in February, we will be updating our operating segments when we complete the transition and are managed in accordance with the new five business segment structure. Community banking earnings declined $274 million from the fourth quarter reflecting higher provision expense as well as net losses from equity securities. On Page 26, we provide our community banking metrics. I'll start by noting that as always, our digital, mobile and primary consumer checking customers are reported on a one month lag. So the numbers reported here for first quarter do not capture the change in customer behavior we experienced in March due to COVID-19. For example, our customers have shifted to depositing checks through our mobile app and the dollar volume of mobile checks deposited increased over 40% in March compared with February. Turning to Page 27, teller and ATM transactions are reported through March which is when we reduced our branch hours and temporarily closed approximately one fourth of our branches as a result of COVID-19, which resulted in approximate 50% decline in teller volume during the final weeks in the first quarter compared with a year ago. Our customers also meaningfully reading use their card spending late in the first quarter due to the impacts of the pandemic. During the first two months of the year, credit card volumes were up from a year ago while March 2020 volumes declined approximately 15% from March 2019, resulting in first quarter credit card purchase volumes being down 1% from a year ago. We also had meaningful shifts in customer spending in March with grocery and pharmacy spending increasing while all other categories were down from a year ago. Debit Card spending trends were similarly impacted, but the change in spend was less significant with year-over-year growth in January and February and a 5% decline in year-over-year volumes in March. Similar to credit card debit card spending shifted significantly to grocery in March, but the growth in this category started to slow in the last week of the month. Turning to Page 28, wholesale banking earnings declined $2.2 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting a $2.2 billion increase in provision expense. I've already highlighted the strong loan and deposit growth from our commercial customers in the first quarter. And we also raised $47 billion of debt capital for our clients. Wealth and investment management earnings increased $209 million from the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, WIM experienced strong demand from clients for liquid products. Period-end deposit balances increased 13% from the fourth quarter, reflecting higher cash allocation and brokerage client assets and assets under management and our Wells Fargo Asset Management business grew significantly driven by over $34 billion of inflows into our money market funds. Despite the market volatility closed referred investment assets into WIM from the consumer bank partnership increased on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis and flows into our retail brokerage advisory business remain positive in the first quarter. As a reminder, retail brokerage advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter. So first quarter results reflected market valuations as of January 1 and second quarter results will reflect market valuations as of April 1. Turning to Page 30, our net charge-off rate was up six basis points from the fourth quarter to 38 basis points, predominantly driven by higher C&I losses primarily related to higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio, reflecting significant declines in oil prices. We had net recoveries in all of our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios and lower losses in our auto portfolio. The increase in credit card losses from the fourth quarter included seasonality. Nonaccrual loans increased $810 million from the fourth quarter to 61 basis points of total loans, which was up five basis points from the fourth quarter and down 12 basis points from a year ago. Commercial nonaccruals increased $621 million predominantly driven by the economic impact of the pandemic. Consumer nonaccrual increased $189 million predominantly, driven by higher nonaccruals in the real estate, 1-4 family first mortgage loan portfolio as the implementation of CECL required PCI loans to be classified as non-accruing based on performance. On Page 31, we provide detail on the performance of our oil and gas portfolio. Oil and gas loans outstanding increased 5% linked quarter and 7% from a year ago, reflecting increased utilization rates, driven by the impact of COVID-19 and the decline in oil prices. Total commitments declined reflecting a weaker credit environment. A significant decline in oil prices in the first quarter resulted in early signs of credit deterioration, particularly in the E&P sector. Total oil and gas net charge offs increased $112 million in the first quarter to $186 million. Nonaccruals declined $66 million from the fourth quarter due to the higher net charge-offs as well as pay downs, partially offset by new downgrades to nonaccrual status in the first quarter. Approximately 84% of nonaccrual loans were current on payments during the quarter. Criticized loans increased 23% from the fourth quarter, predominantly reflecting increases in E&P sector. On Page 32, we highlight our adoption of CECL. At the end of the first quarter the allowance for loans and debt securities was $12.2 billion. $12 billion of this allowance was for loans and unfunded commitments and our allowance coverage ratio was 1.19% of loans. We added $3.1 billion to our allowance for credit losses since the adoption of CECL on January 1. This increase was driven by a number of factors including economic sensitivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the estimated impact to industries most adversely affected by the pandemic, our exposure to the oil and gas industry, draws on loan commitments during the quarter, which were the primary driver of commercial loan growth, and a $141 million reserve build for debt securities reflecting economic and market conditions. Turning to capital on Page 33, even after a multiyear program to return excess capital to shareholders, our CET1 ratio was 10.7% at the end of the first quarter, which continued to be above the regulatory minimum of 9% and our current internal target of 10%. Our period-end common shares outstanding were down 38 million shares from the fourth quarter. On March 15, we along with the other members of the financial services forum, suspended share repurchases through the end of the second quarter. In summary, while our results in the first quarter were impacted by the economic and market uncertainty caused by the pandemic, we maintain strong liquidity and capital. Our priority is to continue to use our financial strength to help the US economy by serving our customers, supporting our employees and donating to our communities. And Charlie and I will now take your questions. Operator, do you want to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] John Shrewsberry : Operator, are there any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Charlie Scharf : The queue is filling I understand. John Shrewsberry : Yeah. Charlie Scharf : Operator, how are we doing? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Charlie Scharf : Hi, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for the color in the deck today. Can I just ask you, John, can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of \u2013 it was good to see the Fed giving you some flexibility to participate in the programs on lending, but can you elaborate a little bit more on \u2013 are you truly able to provide all the help that your customers are asking for? And how are you balancing that demand function on behalf of clients with the magnitude that you have to dial back and the effects that that might have on the company from an income statement perspective? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Sure. Thank you. So on the PPP front, which was the targeted action where the Fed gave us a little extra flexibility. There, I would describe this as unconstrained and in a position to help everybody who approaches us subject to the program, of course, having sufficient funding from a legislative perspective, but no constraints at Wells Fargo. With respect to the other tradeoffs, as I mentioned, the first places that we're going to be able to create more capacity to help customers are to reduce non-operational deposits, principally in the financial institutions area, where relatively easily substitutable and it's a low value use of cap balance sheet because there's a high runoff factor on those types of deposits and there are tens of billions of dollars of those types of deposits to continue to work down. And then secondly, our securities financing footprint or I would describe that as is that plus different sources of wholesale funding. We did this in 2018 when the cap was originally put in place, but we've dialed back, some of the repo financing and other securities financing that we provide and then our own utilization of external repo as a financing source to create more room and that whether some of those activities is first and foremost gets us down below the cap on the spot basis, but then will create some amount of room for us to make choices about how to help our customers and it starts with existing customers and making sure that we can meet their needs. And that's what we're focused on right now. Charlie Scharf : Hi, Ken, this is Charlie. I just \u2013 I know you didn't mean it this way. And I just want to make sure that it's clear for everyone else is that we have no restrictions on participating in these programs. What the Fed did is they allowed us to go above the existing balance sheet cap, so that we could participate in a more holistic way without having to adjust other items, which, as you know, is difficult to do in a shorter period of time. So it provided us the flexibility to do far more than we had chosen to do ourselves based upon our capacity. Ken Usdin : Yeah, exactly, thank you, Charlie. And second question, John, understanding fully the pulling away from giving full year guidance, is there a way you can help us understand on the NII front, just how you'd expect the trajectory at least to go from first to second, given the changes and all the moving parts that were in this quarter's results? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Yeah, it's a fair question, but not quite yet. We've got the \u2013 I think we're all forecasting something like zero in the front end or with depending on where LIBOR moves over time, and then some number between call it 70 and 100 basis points at the long-end. How the \u2013 how deposit pricing reacts to that and it had \u2013 it came down in this quarter and we anticipate it coming down rapidly over the course of the remainder of the year will be a big driver. What of these recent balances that we just booked stick versus those that the dial back down I think will be a big driver, so not looking for NII growth. I'm sure it'll be down by some amount. But we're not freeing any more precise and hopefully by the time we get to either mid or at the end of the second quarter, we'll be in a position to be a little bit more declarative about that. Ken Usdin : Yeah, I appreciate that. Thanks, guys. John Shrewsberry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Charlie Scharf : Hi, Betsy Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, one, just on the outlook for CECL and CECL charges, I mean, you obviously went through in detail what you did this most recent quarter, but just trying to understand what kind of unemployment level you're assuming in that just so if we see a trajectory differently from your assumptions, we know how to think about reserve builds from here. John Shrewsberry : Yeah, so it's a combination of things including unemployment, but to what level and then for how long and then the same with GDP, obviously, other things that are going to matter are what this stimulus means at the personal level and at the business level and whether that's an effective offset to the impact on consumer credit from unemployment. So our scenarios and there's a few of them that we're relying on and we have different weights on each basically are sort of high single digits, sustained down GDP and sustained unemployment really through 2021, while I take it back where we get flat to GDP in 2021, but really not much growth, so quite elongated in terms of the U shape. Hopefully that's helpful. And we'll update as we go along, we're a little less relying on sharp spikes and sharp recoveries and thinking about this a little bit more is a long, slow burn over the next couple of years for risk management purposes. Betsy Graseck : Got it and then if I could drill down just on the oil side, I mean, obviously, we went through an oil event several years ago, was like 2016. And you had some workouts around that, brought down the oil exposure or the gas exposure since then. Maybe you can give us a sense as to how you're thinking about this go round. I mean, the price is obviously a little bit lower, but I'm thinking that your book has changed a bit, maybe if you give us some color on how you're dealing with that portfolio and what your expectations are there? John Shrewsberry : Thanks and the book does look different. So on the one hand, it's smaller, on the other hand it's a little bit \u2013 it's more senior. We had a bigger wait on lowering the capital structure activity before going into the 2015, 2016 downturn. We're imagining because of the levels of the resource price that losses given default are substantially worse this time through. In terms of the migration of performing to non-performing, I'd say in our own credit loss analysis, we're assuming basically across the board, full notch downgrade type of \u2013 in our own estimation of default probability. I think we're approaching it in a pretty sober basis. We've got a good number on it now, both specifically and through our qualitative reserve. And we'll continue I think to up our disclosure around it like we did in 2015, 2016 as we work through that. Betsy Graseck : Okay, but that's embedded within your CECL estimate today already. So if it pans out as expected we wouldn't expect to see any more reserve build on that specific asset class. John Shrewsberry : Yeah. Well, so yes and no. We always end up reserving more than we end up charging off. So when I'm thinking about the through the cycle charge-off my sense is, we have a line of sight on how we expect it to perform. But for any number of reasons we do. And CECLs different than the prior methodology, but I'm not surprised when we lean in a little hard and it turns out that cumulative losses were less than allocated number. It just seems to work out that way. Betsy Graseck : All right, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from John McDonnell with Autonomous Research. John McDonnell : Hey, John, Charlie, John was wondering if you could give any more color on the kind of base case economic scenario that you've baked into the first quarter reserve build and given that like, what kind of macro scenario would have to materialize in the second quarter for you to have a similar sized provision or to be adding more than you added in the first quarter? And then maybe Charlie could just add some thoughts on the potential paths he sees for this credit cycle relative to what you've seen in your career trolley. What are some of the similarities and differences you think about how this might play out relative to great financial crisis or stress test scenarios? Thank you. John Shrewsberry : So I'll go first. And John, it\u2019s still Autonomous Research, right? Not Anonymous Research. John McDonnell : Yeah. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : Sure. Yeah, make sure we get that right. So as I mentioned to Betsy, we're taking kind of a longer window approach rather than a quick V or even a quick view in thinking about growth through the rest of the year and into next year being mid to high single digits negative this year and flattening out but not growing really next year. And then unemployment in the long and sustained high single digit range. They may vary \u2013 there already have been perhaps spikes that go beyond that, but we're thinking about this as it plays out quarter after quarter. So it's just two dimension it compared to other scenarios thinking about both our performance in the financial crisis as well as our own CCAR severely adverse scenarios. At this point we see this as not generating that level of loss in our own CCAR severely adverse scenarios. And if we produce nine quarter credit losses of about two and three quarter percent in total, with peak quarterly loss rates expressed on an annualized basis of about 1.7%, 1.75% and an average of about 1.2%. That's got a steeper drop in GDP and a steeper climb and in unemployment and importantly, no stimulus baked into the severely adverse case, it's \u2013 it doesn't anticipate the types of interventions that we've already seen and we're waiting to see materialize. And with respect to the financial crisis as a benchmark, importantly, at least for Wells Fargo, it may be true for other banks as well. But loan portfolios were very different than the quality of loans, particularly on the single family side was worse. I think our auto portfolio was worse than too. And so there we did produce higher \u2013 somewhat higher loss rates, even higher loss rates than we do today in our own CCAR analysis because the content of the portfolio is different, but I guess I would describe what we're currently imagining now to be \u2013 I'll call it halfish of an annualized loss rate of the severely adverse version of our own stress test. And so if things play out substantially worse, then there's certainly the possibility that we end up building more or experiencing more charge-offs or both, but we feel good about the approach that we've taken in March developing our scenarios with our governance around it and coming into the quarter end. And Charlie, you may have comments on the comparability? Charlie Scharf : Yeah, listen, I think and as I said in my remarks, I think it's \u2013 we all know, we haven't seen anything like this before, there's no clear path to with a \u2013 with any narrow range of outcomes for what unemployment or GDP will be. I mean, when we think about different people's estimates, I mean, you can see GDP differences of10, 20 points across very smart people who do this for a living. Same thing with unemployment, 5, 10 points differences. And so making an analogy of what this environment is to other environments. I just have a very hard time doing. Having said that, I think we feel like the portfolios that we have are stronger than they were at other downturns as I think they certainly are in many banks out there. The real question will ultimately be how long this shutdown actually continues, which again none of us know. But in addition to that, how our actions, whether it's the forbearance plans that we have, or the fee waivers, the things that we're doing very actively to help our clients and the huge amount of government intervention, whether those things will actually be able to bridge individuals and small businesses and larger corporations to the other side of this. I personally wouldn't be surprised that as the earnings cycle continues, and as we start to see these numbers, even though people are talking about big numbers, they'll potentially continue to be surprised by the size of them. And that will create additional volatility in the environment that we live in. And it wouldn't surprise me to continue to have to add to reserves as those things impact, confidence and ultimately what economic growth looks like. But as I said, I think it's different. And again, what we know is we're strong and the industry is strong to be able to handle this. John McDonnell : Great and again as a quick follow up to that. Charlie, the idea of banks maintaining dividend payments is a big debate right now, not just for Wells Fargo, but for the industry overall. And you've cut the majority of distributions, you and the other banks, two thirds of it has been buybacks. And folks talk about the importance of dividends as a signaling. Can you talk about the pros and cons of keeping the dividends for yourself in the industry? Charlie Scharf : Yeah. Well, listen, I think certainly the dividends are certainly important for all those that own the stock and ultimately those that wind up benefiting from stock ownership or for individuals in one way or another, whether it's direct holdings, or whether it's pension plans and things like that. And so I think the income stream that people come to rely on especially at times like this is important, but there has to be an underlying ability for companies to be able to pay. And so to the extent that they have that ability to pay, I certainly think it's the right thing to do for the reasons that I just said. We have strong capital ratios. We do all the stress tests and whatnot that John referred to and determine our ability to return capital in these severely stressed environments. Also remind you that for us, we are slightly different than others because of the balance sheet cap. So our balance sheet cap does limit our ability to deploy capital internally. And so based on that \u2013 that's why we sit here and look at and say that we think the dividends, certainly that we're paying, makes sense. But as I alluded in my prior comments, we don't know what the future looks like based upon the assumptions that we've laid out in these very stressed environments. We do feel good about it, but ultimately the timing and the pace of the recovery is going to determine earnings capacity for everyone to be able to continue to support the level of dividends. John McDonnell : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Charlie Scharf : Good morning, Erica. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a clarifying question on John's question on the dividend because it is a question that investors are asking a lot about Wells Fargo specifically. So before you reported earnings consensus is at 235 for this year versus dividends of 204. And I just wanted to make sure I'm taking away the right message and that the market shouldn't really look at the payout. And instead given that the bright line on capital distributions would be breaking that 9% CET1. We would continue to monitor where your capital levels are relative to the minimum and because of the balance sheet restriction, unlike some peers, you are less able to eat through your capital through RWA growth, is that the right way to think about the dividend going forward? John Shrewsberry : I think that's right. I'd also add Charlie's view, though that as the quarters unfold, and we figure out how long we're going to be in this economic state and what the path forward looks like, and we use that to interpret and an estimate what our go forward earnings trajectory looks like that that's the context for understanding what the steady state dividend should look like. So in terms of like this year's dividend looks like versus this year's consensus or estimated earnings during a time of stress is less germane. I think than A, the fact that we start with ample capital and B, what we think are run rate more steady state earnings are on the way out of this and reflect what the dividend is in light of that. Tell if that's helpful, but yes, the point that Charlie was making about the fact that we're not really in a position to go out and generate substantial incremental RWA through outside loan origination is an important one and a distinguishing one versus others who may be doing that right now and expanding their balance sheet intentionally. Erika Najarian : Got it and my second question is on forbearance. And just a clarification question also and something that you said John, so if possible, could you give us some updates on how many of your clients \u2013 if you could give it to us like by mortgage, by auto or in the 90 day or 60 day forbearance period, how April 1, payment behavior was like? And also just clarify what you said John, you said that potentially the losses, the cumulative losses, this cycle would be 50% of the severely adverse, which I think for nine quarters was 26 billion. John Shrewsberry : What I said was that the current loss rates that are in the scenario that we're talking through are in the neighborhood of half of our current severely adverse and if you're probably looking at last year. And so I'm not making a call on the cumulative level of losses, I'm just making the point that that as a benchmark and answer in response to John's question for contextually, like what is bad really look like. In that instance, over nine quarters, we've generated a calculated two and three quarter percent aggregate credit loss. And for context, in terms of where we are now, these loss rates are lower than that by more than half, roughly half. But I'm not predicting that we're going to go through a cycle like our own severely adverse stress test cycle that lasts for nine quarters and goes that deep, et cetera, just providing a benchmark. With respect to two deferrals, I think we're \u2013 and now in deferrals, I'm including both loans on our own books as well as loans that we service for others because the customers don't distinguish when they call Wells Fargo. And I think at this point, we've had requests for deferring over a million payments, it's about $3 billion worth of P&I. I think about 20% of that relates to loans on our own books and 80% of it is loans serviced for others. It's disproportionately auto and mortgage, the dollars of course, the mortgage because the P&I is bigger there than it is on an auto loan. I don't have the specifics in front of me beyond that, but that's what it amounts to. And then it's probably just worth mentioning that at least with respect for the loans on our own books that we would be deferring interest into the future and recognizing interest revenue on an effective interest basis, which would reduce the amount of interest income in the current period by some amount. It's not \u2013 at this point doesn't seem to be a large amount. We'll give updates on that as this number flattens out at some point. And we recalculate all of the P&I and effective yield, but I don't think it's going to be a huge difference maker in terms of our interest income recognition for the year. Erika Najarian : Got it, thank you. John Shrewsberry : Thanks, Erica. Operator : Your next question comes from line as Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Good morning guys, thanks for taking the question. John, I think you mentioned at one point during the call, there has perhaps been a little bit of an abating in the pace of line of credit draws. I wonder if you can just talk to what you've been seeing since the quarter and I guess it stands a reason that with the quarter ending and your customers may be doing some window dressing there would be less need for line of credit draws, but how is that actually trending? And how would you expect those balances to behave? Is that cash actually getting used? Or are you seeing it just indeed re-deposited back into the bank, what are the phenomenon of work there? John Shrewsberry : Yeah. So those daily \u2013 monitor those daily draws just to understand what's happening by industry, by customer, by customer type, et cetera. And they really have flattened out. And they have been negligible for the last several days more than a week. And so they peaked probably at the end of the third week in April and then \u2013 pardon me in March and then came right back down. So not growing at anything like that pace. So the related question of how long do they stick is a good one. And I guess it depends on the reason for the draw to begin with whether it was window dressing, whether it was a need to access credit markets, which \u2013 some of which had been closed, and some of which are more or less open for high grade market wide open, obviously. But for people who need to go into the syndicated loan market or the high yield market, it's a little bit more by appointment, depending on their story. There were people who drew because of just a hardcore liquidity preference, and they wanted to have quick access to the cash regardless of the messaging that they were sending to their external stakeholders. And they may continue to have that preference for liquidity until people know when the economy is going to open back up. And depending on the nature of the borrower, what it means for their sales forecast. And so I don't think we've seen any meaningful pay downs yet. And as I mentioned in response to the question about NII guidance, whether or not those balances remain outstanding will have an impact on this quarter one way or the other. And currently they're sticking, but they're not, but they're not really growing. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Then if I can ask a second question, just in the \u2013 on Slide 15 where you go through the C&I loans by bucket. Can you talk a little bit about the financials except banks portfolio? I know you've discussed it in the past, but just given all the turmoil, there's been in some of the non-bank areas that maybe a little color and sort of what we should be thinking about that? John Shrewsberry : Yeah, so the buckets of activity there, there's the CLO related activity, so credit managers, there's subscription finance where we're providing leverage to alternative asset managers against the commitments of their limited partners to fund when called, there's leasing, there's auto, there's card, there's mortgage, there's commercial mortgage, et cetera. I'm sure we'll see a little bit more stress in the system. As it relates to the loan balances, they by and large tend to be the highest quality loan balances on a ratings basis or among the highest quality that we'd have because they're generally credit enhanced pools of cross collateralized receivables of one form or another. And that's a huge benefit to us compared to the average portfolio of home loans where you have the first dollar of loss if something goes bad in a loan. Having said that these types of customers will have stress often in their origination function, if they're an originator or in their ongoing capital accumulation if they're an asset manager, there can be stressed on the servicing side of this for those that are our residential mortgage oriented, their life's going to be a little bit harder, presumably as servicing, servicing advances default servicing, things like that pop up, and so we're managing them in that way. On the CLO front, which is a big distinguishing portfolio for Wells Fargo in addition, to what's here was a little bit of overlap, but also in our securities portfolio, we have 30-ish billion dollars\u2019 worth of CLO exposure disproportionately top of the capital structure, AAA, AA that can withstand an extraordinary \u2013 almost a complete level of cumulative defaults with varying levels of loss given default. And we're still very comfortable with that and 80% of that portfolio is externally rated AAA, which I think is a plus. So there haven't been meaningful signs of stress here. We will talk about it. If it becomes so we actively manage it in our allowance calculations. And these are very actively managed borrower relationships, as I mentioned. Scott Siefers : Okay, that's perfect. I appreciate all the color, so thank you for taking the question. John Shrewsberry : Yeah. You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Saul. Saul Martinez : Hey, how are you guys? Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to tackle a couple of things really quickly. First, the interplay of credit in CECL, so you trued up \u2013 you tooth up your reserves, obviously and your ACL ratio is roughly about 120 basis points. And this is probably oversimplifying it, but one way to think about that ratio under CECL is it's an estimate of what you think you're going to lose on the entirety of your log book over the life of the loan at any given point in time. And that number is lower than what it is for all \u2013 for any other large bank even as of January 1. So I kind of want to get your perspective on how much of that do you think is a reflection of just \u2013 you guys have a lower loss content loans, a better risk profile of it, as opposed to maybe some other more idiosyncratic things as I seem to recall that you've marked some loans in the past that were in recovery positions and stuff like that. So and I ask also just because I do get that question occasionally from investors asking if you're undeserved relative to your peers, which I don't think is the case, but I kind of wanted to get your perspective on this. John Shrewsberry : Yeah, I think it's a good question. I think loan mix has a lot to do with it. The question about marked loans historically would have been true, but with the adoption of CECL, most of those marks had to be reversed, which was the source of a portion of our day one adoption negative number. So we don't have that to rely on although we used to. I think the biggest difference is probably the waits that we have on jumbo mortgage versus the wait that we have on credit card in a heads up basis versus other peers. And that's true of both outstanding as well as undrawn. And the allowance if they're to serve both our credit card portfolio, which under most conditions we wish was a bigger capability for Wells Fargo in times like this is a little bit of a saving grace because we expected loss content both in what's outstanding as well as what might be expected to come through from undrawn is more manageable in the size of our balance sheet. It's still as you'd expect the higher loss content, higher loss rate exposure because it's consumer unsecured and unemployment will be a big driver of losses in this cycle or any cycle, But on the on the first lean mortgage front because that business has changed so much in between borrower capacity to repay reserves, LTVs, et cetera. Even in stress our loss estimations for that portfolio are really quite low. And so as you run down different categories of C&I or commercial real estate or the various consumer categories, credit card is the highest and first lean mortgage is lowest and there we have the biggest wait on mortgage and probably the lowest wait on card. Saul Martinez : Okay and I presume in your queue and in Y 90s, you'll be given loan loss allowance by lending category, so we can compare you to your peers by segment, right? John Shrewsberry : Yeah. Saul Martinez : And just one final one, do you have a sense or have you disclosed how much you've actually reserved? Or would you disclose or have a sense for how much you've actually reserved for oil and gas and entertainment and all that all of the higher risk sectors on Slide 28 to 30, just to get a sense of where you stand in terms of reserve level in those categories. John Shrewsberry : We haven't yet \u2013 because most of that is still \u2013 it's still a part of this qualitative top up of the reserve, which is how the big build for this quarter went down. This is all estimation and as a result, it's not specifically allocated by loan grade and buy portfolio. It will get there. Those are the industries that I mentioned or the categories that I mentioned are the ones where we've leaned in the hardest and on a qualitative basis assumed that certain levels of downgrade which lead to the higher reserve factor being attached to them, but it hasn't run through the process yet that way, because we haven't had those downgrades. So we will start to provide more information. I'm not sure if it will be in the queue, but certainly as the cycle unfolds and these things actually start to appear in the calculated, graded reserve for C&I categories in particular. Saul Martinez : Got it, thanks a lot. John Shrewsberry : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Shrewsberry : Hi, John. John Pancari : Good morning. Back to the through cycle loss number, your two and three quarter number, I know you just indicated that cards would be the highest net assumption. Do you have what those through cycle numbers are that you have by bucket for example, commercial real estate and card and C&I that make up the 2.75? John Shrewsberry : Right, so the 2.75 is the CCAR severely adverse through the cycle, cumulative loss level. So it's not through the cycle loss level. And I know \u2013 I'm not sure whether I wasn't clear I don't want anybody to walk away thinking that that's what we anticipate experiencing through the average cycle. We have not laid all of that out. We \u2013 I guess I would look to the categories of loan loss disclosure with our last \u2013 the last stress test, those come from the Fed and it'll come from if you get to Wells Fargo's, but we haven't gone category by category and laid it out. I can tell you that on the commercial side, it's about 2.5% percent and on the retail side it's about 3%. But in terms of the individual components, we haven't run through that with folks. John Pancari : Okay, got it. Got it and then regarding the loan loss reserve from here, I believe, Charlie, you indicated in one of your previous answers that you could see incremental loan loss reserve builds from here. Is that a fair assumption at this point, given the \u2013 given your expectation for the ongoing stress on borrowers et cetera, that we could have incremental builds or do you think the \u2013 we're at an adequate level given the recast of the bank's [ph] book and what you put on this current quarter in terms of where your reserve stands at this point. Charlie Scharf : Yeah, I guess. I guess \u2013 let me just \u2013 I'm not an economist. And so I don't pretend to know any more about the future than anyone else who's in my position. And I \u2013 what I said was I think it's clear that economists are having a difficult time trying to figure out what the trajectory of unemployment in GDP will be. What I was saying was it just it wouldn't surprise me that people will continue to be surprised by the downside in the numbers. We've not seen anything in our own portfolios to suggest that we will be adding in the future. But if confidence does deteriorate and the shelter in place orders stay on for longer, which is possible, then it wouldn't surprise me that loss estimates would have to go up from this point. Again, I just \u2013 it's not based on something that we've seen. We don't know the impact of all the programs that are out there, which we've never seen anything like this before. But there's probably \u2013 I think it's fair to say at least in my mind, there's more downside than there is upside at this point, just given the uncertainty of the environment today. John Pancari : Got it, that's helpful. If I can ask just one more, on the drawdown point, I know you had implied that you're seeing a little bit of stability there on the draws. Have drawdown from the commercial side, trended as you had expected? Or would you have thought that they could have exceeded the current level where they've showed some near term leveling off? John Shrewsberry : So they came out of the gate fast and furious before borrowers actually experienced meaningful stress. So I would say that was a little faster than we probably would have imagined. In terms of how things have leveled off, the prior question about whether there was window dressing going on through the quarter and where our borrowers wanted to have cash on their balance sheet, certainly possible that that was a part of it. The high grade \u2013 well, CP market being inaccessible for many users and the high grade market being expensive or closed for a little bit certainly contributed to it. Two, both of those things are functioning better now and these balances are still maintained. So it's not crystal clear whether that was a contributor to it, but it seemed a little fast. The fact that it \u2013 I think that folks are like Charlie mentioned with respect to our own results are trying to understand how long they're to the \u2013 if they're meaningfully affected from a sales perspective. How long shelter in place is going to change the nature of their business, and they're going to make their liquidity determinations along the way. It feels like many people, many business leaders made that determination relatively quickly in the early drives, but it's, as I said, it's flattened out. Charlie Scharf : Building at it is the time. This is not as we say over and over again this isn't something that we've seen before. And so did \u2013 would we have thought that the number of industries and businesses would be shut down as quickly at the same time? No. Does that increase draw levels and the speed at which they draw? Absolutely. So but the fact that we're seeing some stability in those numbers and reductions in terms of where they are says an awful lot about the actions, certainly that the Fed has taken to stabilize the markets and give people the confidence that the markets will function well when they need to access them. John Pancari : Got it. Alright, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. It seems like expenses in the first quarter came in a bit lower than expected even if we adjust for the deferred comp noise, any outlook that you could provide on cost for the year? John Shrewsberry : Not meaningful, we instituted a few programs for our employees in the first quarter that didn't cost much in the first quarter that will probably contribute a little extra throughout the course of the year. On the other hand, there's a range of revenue related costs that will probably be lower with commissions, incentive comp types of things if the \u2013 depending on business conditions of course and our ongoing level of performance. T&E is pretty much down to zero because people are not travelling or sheltering in place. We will have different technology costs that probably get a little bit more expensive as we've enabled 180,000 people to work from home, that all has to get factored in. And then of course, we've got certain types of expense that are levered to where the stock price is et cetera. And that in this environment will probably be cheaper than it was a year ago, but not anything targeted or meaningful in this moment during the public health crisis beyond that. Charlie Scharf : And the only thing that I would add is as we think about what the future is we were very clear on the last call about our views on our efficiency and the work we had to do. And given the environment that we're in this is not the kind of environment where we're able to realize any meaningful savings. So we need to see line of sight past this crisis in order to continue to get back to the work that we have to do to drive that number down which we still completely believe is there, doable and the right thing. It's just going to take a little more time at this point. Matt O'Connor: Okay, understood. And then you've made some comments in terms of the regulatory issues and obviously, the flexibility to help small business customers, but any just kind of broader update on addressing regulatory issues? And there were some headlines that you are missing some deadlines in the media, which doesn't seem surprising, since a lot of things are shut down. But is there anything you want to add from kind of a regulatory perspective that you are able to comment on? Charlie Scharf : I'm not going to talk about anything specific. It's not the right thing to do. I'll just reiterate. We have a lot of work to do. I've been saying that very, very consistently. Our ability to get beyond some of these regulatory actions is based upon our doing the work properly. There is a bunch of it. We're continuing to devote all the necessary resources towards it, even during this crisis. And that's really what I could say at this point. Matt O'Connor: Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So John just wanted to ask a question about how you're managing the securities book. I recognize you guys pulled again NII dive ins, but I'm just trying to understand given this significant decline that the long end of the curve, I was hoping you could help us frame where you're reinvesting today versus to roughly 2.8% yield on the securities book, and maybe just bigger picture what's your appetite to reinvest in other asset classes, outside of agency MBS and treasuries to maybe mitigate some of those reinvestment pressures? John Shrewsberry : Yeah, it's a good question. So where we're investing today and I think we're \u2013 we've got $6 billion to $9 billion a month of expected prepayment and maturity that needs to get redeployed. We have been and will likely continue to redeploy it into HQ LA. There are certainly interesting opportunities in credit sensitive securities, et cetera. They were really interesting in March, but they're still interesting today. But for low liquidity value, more risk weighted types of investment we're more likely to use our dry powder for our customers. So for loan growth, rather than on the securities front, even though historically we would have done both. And a portion of that is related to the existence of the asset cap. So it's still likely to be treasuries, G&A's and agency mortgages as we redeploy that$6 billion to $9 billion per month for the rest of the year. Steven Chubak : And just for my follow up, I just wanted to try and gauge the near term outlook for fee income. I know there's a lot of moving pieces this quarter, it looked like if we adjust for all the specials, it was about a $1.3 billion drag suggesting maybe a core fee run rate somewhere around 7.7 billion. I'm just wondering as we look ahead, just given some of the pressures you cited on service charges, spend volume contracting, lower fees in wealth given the lag quarter pricing, I guess you'll have an offset from mortgage. I just wanted to try and frame how we should be thinking about the right jumping off point for core key income in 2Q and maybe just speak to your outlook for the remainder of the year. John Shrewsberry : So that's complicated for all the reasons we've been describing. I would say that that you're right about the stepping off point for wealth and investment managements. That will be lower. I expect mortgage to be stronger. We have a $60 billion pipeline and a stronger gain on sale on a per pound basis. So the second quarter should be good in that respect. The markets businesses are actually doing really well right now, although investment banking is quieter, high grade is open, but there isn't quite as much going on in non-investment grade or equity issuance. Card fees should be lower because transactional volumes are lower. Deposit service charges in my sense will be lower because of actions that we're taking on a targeted basis to reverse fees where it's appropriate. And it never works to add it all up and give a starting \u2013give a core number, but those are probably the bigger influences on fee income going into Q2. Steven Chubak : That's great, very helpful color and thanks for taking my questions. John Shrewsberry : Yeah. You're welcome. Thank you Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales. John Shrewsberry : Hello, Charles, Charles Peabody : Hi. It's my guess that tail risk events are not over for this economic cycle. So I was wondering if you could address two different tail risks as they relate to managing your interest rate sensitivity and the impact on your P&L. The first is if we go into a multi-quarter period of negative rates, what are the actions you can take to manage that? And how do you see that impacting your P&L? And then the second is if bond vigilantes ever do come back, and we got a steepening of the yield curve, 125 basis points spread between twos and 10s. What impact does that have on your P&L as it relates to NII, mortgage banking and equity securities or debt securities? John Shrewsberry : Sure, I'd like the second one better than the first one. Charles Peabody : Yeah, I know you would, but also did you take any material actions in the month of March to hedge your interest rate risk going into second quarter? So those are the three separate questions. Sorry. John Shrewsberry : Yeah, so we'll go in reverse order. In the month of March I would say getting longer duration and not much longer, but continuing to replace and add to duration in this investment portfolio is the most visible activity to defend against going lower in rates in any size. On the second question about what happens if we get to steepen, obviously, there's a hit to capital from OCI when that happens because our bond portfolio loses value, but with the amount that we have regularly to reinvest with deposits at levels that they are et cetera. We are sensitive to the, call it that seven to 10 year point and without putting a specific number on it, it's probably the \u2013 it's among the biggest drivers in terms of the way we're positioned for increasing net interest income and the reverse is true as well. And then with respect to negative rates there's a handful of things. I mean, it's obviously, looking at looking at Europe or looking at Japan, there's plenty of examples of why that's not a terrific environment to be in for banking. But on the LIBOR based lending side, I'd make the point that I think substantially all of our C&I loans that are LIBOR based have floors in them. So that we're not worried about eating through margin, still an attractive place to be, but we've protected ourselves in that way. I think there are a range of deposit related activities that we have where we would begin to institute charging for holding cash. Given our \u2013 the existence of the asset cap, we can't overpay for deposits, because we were in the business of sending low liquidity value deposits back to bank customers and alike, so we would probably be pretty quick to be managing what we pay for deposits to \u2013 so that we didn't have an incremental influx that we that we didn't have an appetite for. And then as I mentioned, adding or maintaining a fixed rate posture duration \u2013 the long duration posture on the investment portfolio is a way to abate earning a negative rate as rates go below zero. I don't think you're suggesting there's a higher probability of that. I think Fed's been pretty clear, and have been some instances where bills went negative just because of technical factors, but I don't think it's at least currently part of the playbook for the Fed and then the other jurisdictions around the world where it has occurred out the curve, it started with a policy decision to do it at the front end. So I like the steeper curve better than the negative rates among your questions. Charles Peabody : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hey, good morning. Just a quick question first maybe the mortgage banking and can you kind of walked through the decision to exit on the non-conforming correspondent. I mean, I heard that expecting loss rates below residential mortgage. So the issue with the asset cap or just credit risk more broadly. John Shrewsberry : It's really shelf space and putting our own retail customers at the front line as one of the levers that we're using to manage living under the asset cap, not Fed risk in particular. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then a separate question and there was a lot of kind of one off items in the quarter that were due just to where markets were at the end of the quarter or more spreads were, another was the reserve for debt securities, equity impairments and then often has an effectiveness and it was expected to reverse given where markets are, at this point in time or where rates are for the hedging activity. John Shrewsberry : On hedging effectiveness, I wouldn't expect that to reverse or to persist. It's sort of a confluence of events that gave rise to it for the quarter. So that probably goes back to a debt expectation of call it a net zero expectation and it can drift up or down depending on what happens in the LIBOR OIS basis or for some other reasons. In terms of equity impairments, those [indiscernible] and there are some measurement alternative activities that actually do get written back up when the situation warrants it, but I wouldn't expect that to happen in the early stages of a recession, if that's where we are in the next few quarters. Obviously, there are lots of ways to earn that back over the life of those investments, but it'll take a while for that to reveal itself. And what was the last one? There were a couple different examples. Brian Kleinhanzl : The reserve for debt securities. John Shrewsberry : Yeah. I don't anticipate that it will \u2013 those are \u2013 that relates to both AFS and held for \u2013 held to maturity security. So presumably there are some AFS securities that might get sold or mature that release some of that, but I don't think it just comes right back. That's the nature of OTTI. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks for taking my questions Charlie and John, couple of things. Firstly, how did total criticized loans do in the quarter? I know you mentioned oil and gas. Have we seen any \u2013 firstly any numbers and have we seen any impact of any of those other industries where there's concern? And as you look at your commercial loan book you broke down the drawdown's into CIB, commercial banking, commercial capital and CRE, any color on the outstandings in those and also the breakdown of how criticized did in those four categories? John Shrewsberry : So criticized loan balances increased about $4 billion in the quarter almost all of it in March. I'm trying to do the math here. A big piece of it are \u2013 for those that are in the industries that we mentioned earlier, airlines for example. You'll see it in energy for sure. There have been \u2013 there's some commercial real estate that has already come through. It's just \u2013 it's so early because this all occurred in size in the \u2013 in mid to late March, but we'll probably see more of that realizing itself in Q2, which is part of why our allowance build is really so much from a qualitative perspective. I mean, it's based in math, but it's not driven by loan gradings, et cetera, which drive the quantitative approach. So I think you'll see it coming from the usual places. We'll have more specifics in the 10-Q when we file it and then of course, we'll see the behavior in actual\u2013 we\u2019ll receive financials will administer loans on a loan-by-loan basis through the second quarter and that will update the quantitative model and the disclosures in Q2. Vivek Juneja : And how does your commercial loan book break down between CIB, commercial banking, commercial capital? Really, those are your three biggest categories and I guess there's a little bit of CRE Included in C&I, any color on that? John Shrewsberry : There will be when we publish those segments. What we have in the deck today that shows the total C&I outstandings and commitments is a superset of those businesses. So you can see the total. Where we draw the lines between what it is in which segment. We haven't, haven't added it up and disclosed it that way, but you will begin to see it that way in Q2. Vivek Juneja : Another question you mentioned on the page on deposits that you grew deposits in consumer through high yield savings. Given any color on why you're growing high yield savings [either] you're really not trying -- I didn't think you were trying to grow deposits, any color what's behind that? John Shrewsberry : Yeah, well, high yield isn't the same today as it was a year ago. Some of where we grow is the preference of the customer choosing where they're going to put their money in this label of high yield savings means something different. As I said a little bit earlier, we're forecasting our deposit costs to come down substantially throughout the remainder of 2020, reflecting what you're suggesting, which is in a flight-to-quality timeframe with a liquidity preference by our customers as the deposits are rolling through the door and we are not overpaying for them. You will see in Q2 I think substantially all of the incentives from last year as we were building deposits at a slightly more expensive timeframe to finally roll off and then so through Q2, three and four as we currently forecasted, we're going to be heading back to deposit costs of the --call it 2014, 2015 era. Vivek Juneja : Okay, thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one more question. And that last question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. John, can you share with us on Slide 15, you gave us the total outstandings and the total commitments, I think it is about 58% outstanding to commitments. What was that number at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019? And within those categories you gave us, who had the biggest drawdowns? John Shrewsberry : That's a very specific question you're asking me to answer you. Well, so I don't have that information right in front of me. I can tell you that as a category and this was on Slide 12 in the same deck, our utilization rate jumped up almost 9% to 49%. So for the whole universe of wholesale commitments, we had been in the high 30s and now we're in the high 40s of utilization. I'm going to have our IR folks follow up with you because we do \u2013 we have been tracking utilization, or I should say draw requests by industry and that might be useful, but I don't have it right in front of me. Gerard Cassidy : No, that that's good, thank you. And as someone else complimented you guys the break out on the portfolios for oil and gas, retail, transportation, entertainment was very helpful. If you could provide a suggestion for the next time for the financial except banks, I think that would be helpful. One last question for you, it's a technical question. If your assumptions in CECL are correct on the economy that you guys use to build up the CECL reserve this quarter. If they are correct, in the second quarter, do we see the provision being primarily in the covered net charge offs and loan growth and no more CECL reserve build up? Is that correct? Is that the way we should look at it? John Shrewsberry : In theory, if you had perfect foresight, but you also have to kind of know how to view a growth in the same timeframe, because at the minimum, you'd be capturing allowance for the change in the loan portfolio from one quarter to the next. But I would discourage anyone from imagining that at this point in time that any bank has got perfect clairvoyance about what the future holds, and whether it gets better it gets worse. I'm sure it'll be a little bit different. Gerard Cassidy : No doubt. I appreciate that. Thank you for the candor. John Shrewsberry : Terrific, terrific, well, thank you, everybody, that was our last call. And this is the first step on our journey as we go into this cycle. We've been saying for some time that we're late in the cycle. We're going to stop saying that because now we're early in the cycle and we'll be working with each of you to help understand or answer your questions where we can and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Please note that today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings release and quarterly supplements are available on our Web site at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our Web site. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Good morning everyone. Thank you, John. I'm going to open the call by reviewing what is clearly a very poor quarter for us. I'll review the drivers of our results, make some comments about the environment and discuss the rationale for the intended dividend reduction. I'll then turn the call over to John to review second quarter results in more detail. Our view of the length and severity of the downturn deteriorated considerably from our assumptions at the end of the first quarter and this as well as the knock-on impacts from COVID substantially impacted our results this quarter, we added $8.4 billion to the allowance for credit losses. Charge-offs increased $204 million from the prior-quarter to $1.1 billion. Net interest income was down 13% from the prior-quarter driven primarily by lower rates. The constraints of operating under the asset cap has limited our ability to offset lower rates with balance sheet growth and we actually took actions during the quarter to limit loan and deposit growth, which John will highlight. Expenses included approximately $400 million related to decisions we made due to COVID, most of which we do not expect to be permanent, but was the right thing to do for employees and to improve the safety of our facilities, about $350 million of deferred comp with an offset and fee revenue, $1.2 billion of operating losses primarily for customer remediation accruals related to our ongoing work to remediate the historical issues in community banking as we took another look under new leadership at outstanding matters. This accrual will enable us to do the right thing for our customers, while resolving these matters as quickly as possible. Revenues were lower by about $295 million due to COVID related fee and interest waivers for certain products. In addition, a strong quarter of mortgage production revenue was partially offset by a $531 million write-down of our mortgage servicing rights asset due to higher projected defaults and faster prepayment assumptions. And while it's a smaller part of the company, we did have record revenues this quarter in our Corporate & Investment Bank. Even with the loss this quarter, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.9% from 10.7% last quarter, and it's well above our regulatory minimum of 9%. As a reminder, our regulatory minimum reflects our expected stress capital buffer of 2.5% the minimum possible. As you know, Wells Fargo is predominantly a U.S. bank that takes deposits and makes loans. Our balance sheet composition is 80% cash loans in our investment portfolio and consumers, small businesses, middle market companies and corporate suffer, we do as well. As the economic environment brought on by COVID negatively impacts our customers and clients, it will filter through to our results primarily in the form of outsized credit losses, and compressed net interest margins. Additionally, given we operate with a balance sheet cap, we must prioritize balance sheet capacity, both assets and deposits, and there are certainly an opportunity cost for us in an environment like this. In addition, given the uncertainty and the recovery, we must manage the balance sheet to a level where we can remain below the asset cap, even if there's another period of material loan drawdowns upward or upward pressure on our deposit base. Having said that, we\u2019re responsible for the position we're in, the balance sheet cap exists because leadership failed to both oversee and build the appropriate infrastructure of the company and our financial underperformance is because leadership didn't make the difficult decisions necessary. We\u2019re focused on both of these. We still have much to do to build the right risk and control foundation, which is what our regulators expect and nothing can or will stand in the way of those activities. It is our highest priority. But we also recognize that we've been extremely inefficient for too long and will begin to take decisive actions, none of which will impact our risk and regulatory work to increase our margins. To the first point, we continue to make meaningful changes to improve the foundation of the company. In the second quarter, we announced a corporate risk organizational structure to provide greater oversight of all risk taking activities and a more comprehensive view of risk across the company. Our new risk model will have five line of business Chief Risk Officers to complement the teams and leaders by risk type. During the quarter, we hired a new Chief Operational Risk Officer, a new Chief Risk Officer for Consumer Lending and the Chief Control Executive. We continue to add additional talent to the senior leadership team since I joined the company nine months ago, I\u2019ve announced six new members to the operating committee, all coming from outside of Wells Fargo with strong and relevant industry experience, over two-thirds of our operating committee have joined Wells Fargo since 2018. All of our business line CEOs are now in place, including Mike Weinbach who joined Wells Fargo in May, as CEO of Consumer Lending and Barry Sommers who joined at the end of June as CEO of Wealth and Investment Management. Lester Owens will be joining us next week in a newly created role as Head of Operations. Lester has more than 30 years of experience in the financial services industry and senior operations roles. He will be responsible for building a more integrated approach to Wells Fargo's business operations functions. He has a proven track record in delivering a better customer experience while driving substantial efficiencies at the same time. We also made significant hires and roles rundown from our operating committee including a new Head of Government Relations, Corporate Communications and corporate responsibility as well as Chief Administrative Officer and a new Head of our Home Lending businesses. We continue to have over 200,000 employees working from home and we plan to have employees who are currently working from home continue to do so until at least September. It is too early to determine exactly when we will ultimately return to a more traditional work environment. But we will be cautious about bringing people back into the office. While I do believe there are meaningful benefits of people working physically together, we will move forward when we\u2019re comfortable that the health risks are manageable. Where there is a specific need, we will do so with the appropriate safety precautions in place. And we will make these decisions by geography, by facility. We've done this since the beginning of the crisis, and we\u2019ll continue to do so and serve our customers and communities. We've made significant accommodations for our customers through the end of June, we have helped more than 2.7 million consumer and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees. This includes over 2.5 million payment deferrals representing more than $5 billion in principal and interest, including $3.2 billion in mortgage loans service for others. We provided approximately $6 million fee waivers for consumer and small business customers exceeding $200 million. For our commercial clients, we processed approximately 246,000 deferrals representing more than $1.5 billion of principal and interest payments. In addition for commercial distribution and auto finance customers, we provided the maturity date extensions representing approximately $6.6 billion of outstanding principal and interest. Through the end of June, we have funded 179,000 PPP loans totaling $10.1 billion with an average loan size of $6,000, 60% of those were for loan amounts of less than $25,000, 84% of those were for companies that had fewer than 10 employees, 90% have less than $2 million in annual revenues, and 41% were to companies in low and moderate income areas for at least 50% minority census tracts. And we announced last week are open for business funds. We have committed to donating approximately $400 million in gross processing fees earned from the payroll protection plan to help support businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and we will work with non-profit organizations to provide capital, technical support and long-term resiliency programs to small businesses with an emphasis on serving minority owned businesses. Customer deposits have continued to increase reflecting unprecedented government stimulus programs, lower spending and customers converting investments into cash while commercial deposits declined, reflecting actions we took to manage under the asset cap, which John will describe in more detail. In March, our commercial customers utilized over $80 billion of their loan commitments during the market turbulence at the onset of the pandemic and almost all of those loans were paid down in the second quarter. Debit card spend started to increase in April and returned to pre-COVID levels in May and in the last full week of June were up approximately 10% from the same week a year-ago. Consumer Credit Card spend improved steadily starting in mid-April, but was still down approximately 10% from the year-ago as of the end of June. Commercial card spend remained significantly lower throughout the second quarter and was still down over 30% in the last full week of June compared to the same week a year-ago with declines across industry segments, we continue to monitor our consumer and commercial customer spending trends as the nation goes through the various stages of reopening. Trends in digital usage are strong, mobile deposit dollar volume was up over 100% in the second quarter compared with a year-ago. In the second quarter, digital logins were up 21% from the year-ago. Let me turn to the dividend now. Today we announced that our board expects to reduce our dividend for the third quarter to $0.10 per share. The Federal Reserve has authorized banks to pay common stock dividends that do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the bank's net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. Based on these instructions, we previously announced that this limitation would cause us to reduce the dividend from the current level of $0.51 a share. In addition, while this requirement currently applies to the third quarter, Federal Reserve stated it reserves the right to extend the limitations and learns more about the evolution of the COVID event. Separately from this, our board has been reviewing the level of the dividend and I discussed the way in which we would approach evaluating the right go forward level. First we look at our capital position. As I said, our capital position remains quite strong. So our current capital level is not the driving factor in our decision. Having said that as we look forward, we do not pretend to have a deeper understanding of the path of the recovery than others. Using our economic assumptions, our capital levels remain above the minimum required and our CCAR results confirm the strength of our capital position. But we believe it's prudent to note that our assumptions are just that. So we felt it was appropriate to factor this uncertainty into our thinking around the appropriate dividend level in this environment. After evaluating our capital position, we considered our current and expected earnings level. We expect the impact of COVID to continue to negatively impact our earnings until we see a clear trend of meaningful improvements in unemployment and GDP. This will result in continued lower levels of NII and certain economically sensitive fee revenues as well as potentially unforeseen expenses to operate in this environment. In addition, while our ACL is intended to cover expected losses based on our current economic assumptions, we're mindful of the uncertainty and the need to reevaluate these assumptions continually. And I will discuss this more. But while we'd have actively begun to address the fact that our expenses are significantly too high, it will take some time to see the impact of our actions in our results. Putting this all together, it is critical in these uncertain times that our common stock dividend reflects current earnings capacity, assuming a continued difficult operating environment, evolving regulatory guidance and protects our capital position if economic conditions were to further deteriorate. Given this, we believe it's prudent to be extremely cautious until we see a clear path to broad economic improvement. We're confident that this eventual economic improvement combined with our actions to increase our margins will allow our wonderful franchise to support a higher dividend in the future. We're extremely disappointed to take this action and do understand that many rely on this stream of income. However, we must be prudent in this environment. I have acknowledged in the past that our expenses are too high, and that we're building roadmaps to improve our efficiency ratio. To repeat, there's nothing structurally different about Wells Fargo that prevent us from being as efficient as our large peers, but we\u2019re far from it. For us to bring our level of efficiency close to our peers, the math will tell you we need to eliminate over $10 billion of expenses. While our work is not yet complete to commit to specific numbers and timeframes, we expect to take a series of actions beginning in the second half of the year to begin to reduce our expense base and bring our expenses in line with the size and composition of our businesses. This will be a multi-year effort for sure but would like to see a reduction in expenses next year and we now have a centralized team driving the effort across the enterprise and our lines of business and functional areas have dedicated resources stacked against this. This work did not start in the last few months. But the extremely challenging operating environment and uncertain outlook has accelerated our sense of urgency. It\u2019s important to note that I deeply believe that this exercise is about making us a better and more efficient company, not just about reducing expenses. We have too many management layers, spans of controls for managers are too narrow. And we have resources dedicated to activities that are not a priority today. This cannot continue. We also have the opportunity to apply lessons we have learned since the onset of the pandemic, to drive efficiency across the company. Over the medium term, we have the opportunity to materially reduce our expense, including increasing digital adoption for retail and commercial clients, reducing third-party spend, consolidating locations including branches, field offices and corporate sites and applying technology differently. In addition, the opportunity to consolidate our operational platforms is still meaningful. As a financial company and specifically a G-SIB, we must be strong financially to serve our customers and support our communities, but also to provide growing opportunities for our employees and while our balance sheet is strong, our margins are too narrow. To ensure we\u2019re thatsource of strength we need to begin to take action to improve our results. As I've said, and I'll say it again, we will not do anything that will impact the work we have underway to build out our risk and control environment. The opportunity to become more efficient exists elsewhere in the organization and we will protect this work at all costs. I'll continue to share more specifics about our plans as they develop and we will be talking more about this next quarter. While there remains much economic uncertainty, many market liquidity trends are strong as Fed programs continue to effectively support the smooth functioning of the capital markets, while still wide to pre-crisis levels, market spreads have continued to improve since the peak of the dislocation and have retraced 70% to 90% of their mid-March widening. Liquidity and treasury and interest rate swap markets returned to pre-crisis levels and the Fed\u2019s open market purchase program has stabilized mortgage basis valuations and improve liquidity, HQLA bid-ask, a measure of the cost to transfer risk has retraced to pre-crisis levels while measures of volatility are now below pre-crisis levels. However, the economic recovery will not be smooth. Much of the economy is still essentially closed or just beginning to open and additional restrictions are being implemented as the spread of the virus continues to increase in many areas of the world. While consumer spending has increased from levels at the end of the first quarter, it is still down from a year-ago with significant declines in the areas like travel, entertainment and restaurants. And while government stimulus programs provided a safety net for many, they\u2019re scheduled to run-off raising the possibility of more economic hardship ahead. Having said all of this cities, communities, people and businesses are all learning what it takes to reopen safely, and there is progress on vaccines and therapeutics. We will do what we can to support the fastest recovery possible, but we will be cautious in our outlook until we see the facts. I want to conclude my comments today by discussing an important topic racial injustice. In my conversations with different groups over the past months, the pain and frustration with the lack of progress within both our country and Wells Fargo's clear, inequality and discrimination has been clearly exposed and must not continue. Wells Fargo has not been effective in creating enough diversity, or consistently inclusive environment. I've outlined a number of actions we\u2019re taking around race to change the outcomes, including creating a new role which will have a broad mandate of driving diversity and inclusion in both the workplace, but also our business. We'll be evaluating operating committee members based upon their progress and improving diverse representation and inclusion in their area of responsibility and it will have a direct impact on year-end compensation decisions. And we've announced the donation of these gross processing fees for PPP estimated to be approximately $400 million. This is just the beginning of the work needed to address this crisis and to meaningfully contribute to the change that is necessary. But I believe that this is a watershed moment and we will be part of making sure this time is different. Finally, I want to thank all of the employees at Wells Fargo who continue to work tirelessly to serve our customers and successfully execute on our priorities. I will now turn the call over to John. John Shrewsberry : Thanks, Charlie. Good morning, everyone. Charlie's comments covered most of the information on Page 2 of the supplement including the largest driver of our reported loss, which was the $8.4 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses in the second quarter. So let me highlight just a couple things here. First, our income taxes in the second quarter reflected the impact of annual income tax benefits primarily tax credits driven by our reported pretax loss. As a result, we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 26%, excluding the impact of any discrete items. Also, deferred compensation plan investment results increased net gains from equity securities by $346 million and increased personnel expense by $349 million. As we've highlighted many times, while these hedges are largely P&L neutral, that can result in large swings in our reported revenue and expense trends. In late May, we entered into arrangements to transition these economic hedges from equity securities to derivatives in the form of total return swaps. As a result of this change, starting in the third quarter, our reporting for this item will be less volatile since most of the accounting impact from deferred comp hedges will be reported in personnel expense. Turning to Page 3, Charlie covered the support we\u2019re providing to our customers and communities during the pandemic. But let me just highlight that approximately $400 million donation for small business recovery efforts we announced last week through the new Open For Business Fund will be donated when the gross fees are recognized in revenue. Turning to Page 4, while our earnings in the second quarter were significantly impacted by the economic environment. Our capital and liquidity continued to be strong with both our CET1 ratio and LCR increasing from the first quarter. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.9%, 190 basis points above our current regulatory minimum of 9%. We expect our stress capital buffer to be 2.5% which is the lowest possible under the new framework and would result in the regulatory minimum for our CET1 ratio remaining at 9%. Even with the large increases in our allowance over the past two quarters, our CET1 level was $23.7 billion above the regulatory minimum. Our LCR increased to 129%, 29 percentage points above our regulatory minimum and our primary unencumbered sources of liquidity are approximately $511 billion. Turning to loans on Page 5, similar to industry trends, period-end consumer and commercial loans outstanding declined in the second quarter, but average balances grew reflecting increases in outstanding balances late in the first quarter. I'll explain the drivers of consumer and commercial period-end loan balances in more detail starting with consumer on Page 6. Consumer loans were down $20.1 billion or 5% from the first quarter. This decline includes the reclassification of $10.4 billion of conforming first mortgage loans to held-for-sale status to provide flexibility to manage our balance sheet under the asset cap. The economic slowdown from COVID-19 reduced consumer spending and was reflected in lower credit card balances, lower auto originations and other revolving and installment loan balances. In addition, we took actions during the second quarter to tighten credit standards given the current economic environment and to manage to the constraints of the asset cap. These actions included no longer purchasing jumbo mortgage loans through our correspondent mortgage business and not accepting Home Equity and personal line of credit applications. In the auto business, we've taken actions to mitigate future loss exposure and our spreads on new originations improved to their highest levels since 2016. That said States begin to reopen later in the quarter, we saw increased loan demand including higher credit card spending and higher auto loan originations. Turning to commercial loans on Page 7, C&I loans declined $54.9 billion or 14% from the first quarter driven by pay downs of revolving loans following increased loan draws in the first quarter during the market turbulence at the onset of the pandemic. As Charlie highlighted, almost all of the $80 billion of loan draws in March were paid down during the second quarter. These pay downs were partially driven by strengthen capital markets and help drive record revenues in the second quarter in our corporate and investment bank. Commercial real estate loans increased $2.1 billion from the first quarter with growth in both commercial real estate mortgage and in construction loans. Turning to deposits on Page 8, the industry has experienced very strong growth but due to our asset cap constraint, we've worked to manage growth of certain lower liquidity value deposit categories. However even after these actions, average deposits grew 9% from a year-ago and 4% from the first quarter. The linked quarter growth was driven by non-interest bearing deposits which were up 18% while interest bearing deposits declined 1%. Period-end consumer and small business banking deposits grew $78.6 billion from the first quarter. This strong growth reflected COVID-19 related impacts including customers preference for liquidity, loan and tax payment deferrals which otherwise would have reduced deposits, stimulus checks and lower consumer spending. Wholesale banking deposits declined $32.1 billion reflecting actions we took to manage under the asset cap including an emphasis on reducing certain non-operational deposits. Average deposit costs declined to 17 basis points down 35 basis points from the first quarter with declines across all of our lines of business. While wholesale banking deposit costs declined the most reflecting higher deposit betas both WIM and retail banking deposit costs also declined. We currently have no active retail banking promotions and we expect deposit costs will continue to decline in the second half of this year and reach the single digit lows realized in 2015 and 2016. Net interest income declined $1.4 billion or 13% from the first quarter due to balance sheet repricing driven by the impact of the lower interest rate environment, $275 million less favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results driven by large interest rate changes, $187 million of higher MBS premium amortization due to higher prepayment rates. And these declines were partially offset by a shift to a lower cost mix of funding. Net interest income was down 13% for the first half of the year and as I discussed in June, we currently expect net interest income to be in the $41 billion to $42 billion range for the full-year 2020 which would be down 11% to 13% from the full-year of 2019. This decline reflects the lower interest rate environment and the constraints the asset cap places on our ability to grow the size of our balance sheet as well as higher MBS premium amortization, which we expect to persist for the remainder of the year. Turning to Page 10, non-interest income increased $1.6 billion or 24% from the first quarter, driven by a $1.9 billion increase in net gains from equity securities reflecting lower securities impairment and higher deferred compensation plan investment results. We will explain explaining some of these drivers in more detail. Deposit service charges were down $279 million from the first quarter driven by COVID-19 related impacts including lower overdrafts as customers have reduced debit card transactions and increased deposit balances as well as higher fee waivers. Trusted investment fees declined $223 million from the first quarter. Investment banking had a strong quarter with revenue increasing $156 million or 40% driven by strength in debt and equity capital markets. This growth was more than offset by both lower retail brokerage advisory fees which were priced at the beginning of the second quarter when market levels for advisory assets pricing were lower and decline in brokerage transactional revenue. Mortgage banking revenue was relatively stable linked quarter with strong growth in mortgage loan originations more than offset by declines in servicing income. Total residential held for sale originations increased 30% from the first quarter to $43 billion primarily driven by lower mortgage interest rates. Lower interest rates drove strong industry volume, the second quarter estimated to be the largest origination market since the third quarter of 2003. As we managed our application pipeline to handle the strong demand, our margins increased. In the second quarter, our production margin on residential held for sale mortgage loans was 204 basis points up from 108 basis points in the first quarter. We've continued to add capacity and expect originations to increase in the third quarter if rates remain low, and we would expect margins to be relatively stable with second quarter levels. Servicing revenue declined $960 million from the first quarter. But decline was driven by a lower valuation of our MSR asset as a result of updated assumptions including higher prepayment assumptions, and higher expected servicing costs due to an increase in projected defaults. Servicing fees were also lower due to payment deferrals and fee waivers provided to our customers in response to the pandemic. Finally, net gains from trading activities increased $743 million from higher trading volumes across many products, increased volatility leading to a wider bid offer spreads and substantial spread and price improvement in certain capital markets. Turning to expenses on Page 11, as Charlie highlighted, our expenses are too high. And we're beginning to take further action to improve our efficiency. The $1.5 billion increase in our expenses from the first quarter was driven by higher operating losses as well as higher personnel expense reflecting a $947 million increase in deferred comp expense. Charlie described the $1.2 billion of operating losses which included $765 million of customer remediation accruals for a variety of matters as well as higher litigation accruals. The $597 million increase in personnel expense included the increase in deferred compensation which is P&L neutral, and $231 million of COVID-19 related employee expenses including premium pay for those who had to come into the office and payments for backup childcare. Most of the COVID-19 related employee expenses have now expired. We also had $133 million of higher COVID-19 related occupancy expense to make our property safer for our employees and customers, including enhanced cleaning, additional supplies and workstation modifications. These costs will likely remain elevated until the pandemic ends. The impact of COVID-19 also reduced some of our expenses including travel and entertainment and advertising and promotion expense. Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 12 as Charlie highlighted, we now have the leadership for our five business segments in place. And we will transition to reporting our segments in accordance with the structure starting in the third quarter. Community banking reported a net loss of $331 million driven by an increase in provision expense. On Page 13, we provide our community banking metrics. We had 31.1 million digital active customers up 4% from a year-ago. While the number of digital customers remained stable from the first quarter, these customers are doing more digitally with logins up 10% from the first quarter. And the number of checks deposited using a mobile device reaching a record high in the second quarter, up 32% from the first quarter, approximately 20% of our branches are temporarily closed due to COVID-19 as a result of fewer branches being opened and increased digital usage teller and ATM transactions were down 19% from the first quarter, and 28% from a year-ago, however, we still have approximately 1 million teller transactions occurring at our branches every business day. Our customers demand for cash has decreased by approximately 20% compared to a year-ago. This decrease was reflected in lower demand for cash in our branches. While ATM transaction volume was down, the amount of cash withdrawn at our ATMs has increased reflecting higher levels of cash per withdrawal in part driven by the higher ATM withdrawal limits we implemented in the first quarter. Charlie highlighted the improving trends we experienced during the second quarter for debit and credit cards spend, higher debit card spend later in the quarter resulted in total second quarter spend being flat compared with a year-ago. However, transaction volume was down 13% from a year-ago with customer spending more per transaction. As a reminder, debit card fees are based on transaction volume, not dollar volume. Turning to Page 14, wholesale banking reported a net loss of $2.1 billion as revenue growth was more than offset by an increase in provision for credit losses. I've already discussed the drivers the loans and deposits, so let me highlight a few other business drivers. Corporate and Investment Banking capital markets had record revenue in the second quarter driven by the trading revenue increases I described earlier and record investment grade debt issuance. Wells Fargo Capital Finance was the number one book runner of asset based loans with year-to-date market share increasing to 20%. We maintained our leadership position in this market by providing an important source of liquidity to our customers during a very challenging time. Wealth and investment management earned $180 million in the second quarter down 61% from the first quarter, primarily driven by an increase in the allowance for credit losses, the lower interest rate environment and lower market valuations at the beginning of the quarter. We continue to experience strong demand from clients for liquidity products with growth in deposits and money market funds and our asset management business. Wells Fargo Asset Management achieved a record high $578 billion in assets under management in the second quarter, up 12% from the first quarter driven by continued momentum in the money market business, higher market valuations and fixed income net inflows. While advisory assets in our brokerage business increased 14% during the quarter, we had lower retail brokerage advisory fees since they're priced at the beginning of the quarter when market valuations were lower. These fees will benefit from the stronger markets at the beginning of the third quarter. Turning to credit results for the company on Page 16. Our net charge-off rate was up eight basis points from the first quarter to 46 basis points which is still in historically low level, particularly during an extremely challenging economic environment. Keep in mind that significant amount of customer accommodations we've provided for our consumer and commercial customers since the start of the pandemic will delay the recognition of net charge-off delinquencies and non-accrual status for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or non-accrual status. However, I will point out that this dynamic was considered in our allowance for credit losses. Commercial criticized assets increased $13.3 billion or 53% from the first quarter with C&I up $7.2 billion and CRE up $6.1 billion. Non-accrual loans increased $1.4 billion from the first quarter driven by growth in commercial non-accruals. I would note that 75% of our commercial non-accrual loans were current on interest principal as of the end of the second quarter. We provide more detail on C&I, non-accrual loans on Page 17. While C&I loans outstanding and total commitments declined from the first quarter, non-accrual loans increased 59% driven by oil and gas and real estate and construction C&I loans, which includes credit facilities to REITs and other non-depository financial institutions. Last quarter, we provided more details on industries with escalated monitoring and those industries largely drove the increase in criticized assets in the second quarter, including retail, entertainment and recreation. Turning to our commercial real estate portfolio in Slide 18, we are the nation's largest commercial real estate lender and our portfolio is well diversified both by property type and geography. Our commercial real estate loans are subjected to rigorous underwriting standards and are well structured. Before COVID-19, this portfolio was performing in historically strong credit levels with a good mix of assets and geography, a well capitalized customer base and overall low levels of leverage. We had proactively reduced our exposure to retail and have minimal exposure to land or condos where losses were highest in the last cycle. Since the pandemic began, we've worked to assist customers on a case by case basis, we've continued our strict routine monitoring process with the goal of identifying problems early. Our CRE team has an experienced bench with workout backgrounds and perspective in times of distress which has enabled us to ramp-up quickly. However, these are unprecedented times and non-accruals were up $286 million or 30% from the first quarter, given what's been going on in the economy is not surprising the shopping centers, retail and hotels, motels accounted for 59% of non-accrual loans in the second quarter and accounted for 90% of the increase from the first quarter. Criticized assets were up $6.1 billion, or 140% from the first quarter driven by the same sectors that drove the increase in non-accruals with the addition of office buildings. Turning to our oil and gas portfolio on Page 19, oil and gas loans accounted for 1% of our total loans outstanding, with $12.6 billion outstanding at the end of the quarter, down 12% from the first quarter. Total commitments were down $1.7 billion from the first quarter reflecting the impact of Spring redetermination changes on borrowing basis, proactive portfolio management, as well as the weaker credit environment, net charge-offs increased $111 million from the first quarter with 87% of second quarter net charge-offs from the E&P sector. Non-accrual loans increased $865 million from the first quarter with approximately 93% of non-accruals still current on payments. Criticized loans increased 26% from the first quarter, reflecting downward credit migration resulting from commodity price volatility and included numerous credit downgrades of publicly rated companies. On Page 20, we provide detail on our allowance for credit losses, the $8.4 billion increase included $6.4 billion for commercial loans and $2 billion for consumer loans, our allowance coverage for total loans was 2.19% of 100 basis points from the end of the first quarter with the largest increases across commercial loans, junior lien mortgage loans and credit card loans. We highlight the key drivers of the increase in our allowance for credit losses on Page 21. We considered current economic conditions which worsened significantly compared to prior expectations as unemployment levels reached 14.7% in the second quarter, in addition over $2.4 trillion in fiscal stimulus programs as well as customer accommodations provided near-term support for borrowers. On this page, we provide details on the economic forecast and our base case scenario for the second quarter allowance, which assumes near-term economic stress, recovering in the late 2021 including unemployment levels declining to approximately 6% by the fourth quarter of 2021. Our housing prices are forecasted to remain relatively stable, commercial real estate prices are forecasted to decline by low to mid-teens with hotel, restaurant and retail sectors expected to decline much further. In addition, collateral prices remain highly uncertain given limited property sales. By the large majority of weights placed on the base case scenario, we apply some weighting to a downside scenario to reflect the uncertainty in the economic forecast. And as I previously mentioned, customer forbearance and other deferral activities provided in response to COVID-19 were considered in our loan portfolio performance expectations and loss forecast. However, please keep in mind that our allowance for credit losses is influenced by a variety of factors including changes in loan volumes, portfolio credit quality as well as general economic conditions. While the timing of the end of the pandemic and the eventual path to economic recovery remain unclear, we believe that our allowance captures the expected loss content in our portfolio as of the end of the second quarter. Turning to capital on Page 22. As I highlighted earlier, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.9% in the second quarter, we elected to apply the modified CECL transition provision to our regulatory capital. The impact of this selection was to increase in capital of $1.9 billion and a 14 basis point increase in our CET1 ratio. Additionally, as a result of senior debt issuance during the second quarter and a decline in our RWA, our TLAC ratio increased to 25.3%, which provides a significant buffer to our required minimum of 22%. In summary, our results in the second quarter were disappointing and economic conditions remain uncertain, but we're focused on doing the work necessary to improve the earnings capacity of the company, including reducing our expenses while meeting our regulatory commitments. And Charlie and I will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Yes, good morning. My first question is a clarification question for Charlie. Charlie, during your prepared remarks, you noted that your expenses were about $10 billion greater than your peers or where you need to be to be equivalent to peers on efficiency. Are you saying that lopping off $10 billion in expenses is an eventual long-term goal for this company to be in line with their larger peers? Charlie Scharf : Well, I mean, what I said was that the math, if you do the math, what it says is that when you look at their efficiency ratios versus ours, our expenses are at least $10 billion higher than they should be. And there's no reason why that should occur. And so we are doing the work to create a roadmap for a company which is significantly more efficient. Exactly what the timeframe is and where we ultimately get to I think, we will provide more information on when the future will play itself out. But we can do the same math that you can do. And there's no reason why as a management team, we don't have the ability to be as efficient as the rest. Erika Najarian : Got it. That's clear. And my follow-up question has to do with the potential for the Fed to extend the income test beyond the third quarter dividend. And I'm wondering, so as we think about you mentioned that expenses should start coming down in 2021. As I think about how consensus is formulating future earnings power, I think consensus is expecting that your majority of your reserve build should be behind you. But I don't think that restructuring costs for example that would relate to future efficiency initiatives are in with consensus and against the question that I'm really asking here is that if the Fed extends the income test beyond the third quarter, do you feel confident that according to how they're looking at dividend capacity, the $0.10 is supportable going forward? John Shrewsberry : Sure, this is John. We certainly have the ability to extend the current framework. And frankly, it even seems likely just given the way the calendar lines up in the resubmission process is going to work for the next CCAR, I think Charlie's point is we're going to do what's necessary to get as efficient as we can be. And to the extent that that kicks off one-time charges which you might expect, and if that has an influence on our dividend capacity as a result of the Fed keeping the current regime in place, then they will have to tolerate that. I don't think we're not going to do what's right economically, because of accounting consequences, we're going to do, we're going to follow GAAP, we're going to get as efficient as we can, the outcome is going to be the outcome, we in part, we set the current dividend or propose to set the current dividend where it is, so that it would buy us plenty of room to operate while we get through the next few quarters and chart the eventual path to greater profitability. But accounting consequences will be what they are, it wasn't a primary consideration in setting the number where we did. Charlie Scharf : The only thing I would add is I think that when we think of the work that we did, we didn't our boards didn't approach this conversation around the dividend with an idea of at each quarter and making a determination. And so our hope is that, this does become a level which is sustainable as we go through this period of uncertainty and as the Fed decides how they want to treat capital return over the next series of quarters, we do have some items that impact our capital, our ability to return capital with this rule that doesn't reflect our earnings power going forward, right. We had a $3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice, which is in our historical numbers, that $3 billion, when you look at it as something like round numbers, $0.18 a share of a negative that ultimately will roll out and is already actually in our capital number. So we have these dynamics that the board thought about when we set the dividend level for the quarter that don't relate to the future earnings capacity of the company, even as we look out into 2021. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you for the clear answers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonnell with Autonomous Research. John McDonnell : Yes, hi. Good morning, John could you remind us just where you're on the asset cap flexibility, what needs to be done each quarter now with deposits coming in and some loan demand and what kind of flexibility you have to operate under that and where you are today on the way it gets measured? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Sure, sure. So we were in compliance with it at the end of the second quarter. And the items that we did during the late first and early second quarter to maintain compliance, we're really focused on our wholesale funding footprint by shrinking the amount of external repo and other financing that we do and taking trading assets down and we had a focus on certain categories of non-operational deposits, the ones that have very low liquidity value. And it's really this is from this point forward. It's more of our liability management exercise to make sure that that we don't retain too much in the way of low liquidity value deposits that we're thoughtful about other liabilities. On the asset side, there's so much cash on the balance sheet right now that it gets plenty of flexibility having to do what we need to do with loans. You saw that our LCR is 129% for the quarter and deposits have grown nicely. So we're very thoughtful and cautious about how we price deposits, it's about those that have low liquidity value. We're thoughtful about maturities as they come up in non-deposit funding because with the inflow of deposits, we can rely more on that and less on notes and institutional CDs and other things. That's the work that we've been doing and that's the path that we have for the next quarter or two. John McDonnell : Okay, and you reiterated the net interest income outlook for the year, how should we think about kind of jumping half point for the net interest margin and net interest income as we go into next quarter, what are some of the puts and takes that we should factor in the model? John Shrewsberry : I think it's going to be relatively flat from where it is today. We're sort of we're in that zone. As I said, $41 billion to $42 billion for the year still feels like the right number. So I think it'll be, we're not really carefully managing the NIM as we're looking for the dollars in net interest income. But it shouldn't deviate too much from where we\u2019re right now. John McDonnell : Okay, got it. And is there anything in terms of asset cap progress, Charlie can comment, I know you can't say too much, but in terms of the work being done and progress and doing what you need to do to satisfy the Fed? Charlie Scharf : No, John, I appreciate everyone being interested given the limitations of it and asking the question, it's going to be the same response every single quarter, which is we're focused on it. It is along with the other enforcement actions, the biggest priority that we have, we're doing our work. And the Fed will determine when the work is done to their satisfaction. John McDonnell : Understood. Thanks. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Charlie Scharf : Hi, Scott. Scott Siefers : Good morning. Hey, thanks for taking. John, just was hoping you might be able to sort of update or refresh your thoughts on how and sort of when losses might evolve, I guess embedded in that is sort of how are you treating reups deferral request things like that, may I guess additionally, the updated reserve build kind of implies sort of what you think about cumulative losses through the period, but just any updated thoughts you can share, please? John Shrewsberry : Yes, well as it relates to deferrals which generally speaking is the consumer side of the house. The fact that we are deferring definitely pushes out, rolls through delinquency buckets into charge-offs and so the actual charge-offs themselves will probably come later than they otherwise would, we believe that we've fully provided or captured that in the allowance. So we've taken the credit charge today that we think is the right one at the end of the quarter even if the charge-offs come somewhat later. We're also seeing, we saw pick-up in charge-offs in commercial but there also things do take a little bit before they roll, I think I guess I would expect charge-off rates and they'll be different by asset category to sort of move up slowly through the end of the year, even into the first couple of quarters and next year, and then start to flatten out after that just based on the way things progress through loss recognition. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. And then maybe just to switch gears a little, the additional customer mediation accrual. Charlie or John, could you go through sort of the, I know you alluded to sort of taking a fresh look at things under new management. But I was curious given the charges we've already seen over the past couple of years sort of what drove those additional accruals and the new thinking? John Shrewsberry : As Charlie said, it was his new leadership at the top of the organization in consumer lending and in the center capability that we have running customer remediation. I think they've gone, they've gone item by item and thought about how to be a little bit more expansive, a little bit more consumer friendly, many of these things aren't crystal clear. And you're always making a judgment as to who it applies to, how much should apply, and over what timeframe and really in an effort as Charlie said to speed it up and move it through. They were a little bit more expansive in order to, but think to accomplish that. But it's by and large, it's the same items that we've been talking about for the last couple of years. There are always new things that come in out of that bucket. But the bigger dollars relate to the same topics that we've been covering for a while. Charlie Scharf : And the only thing I would emphasize as John said is, most of the dollars do relate to those items. And there's valid, there's a lot of value in getting these things behind us. It's the work, it's the overhang. It's what our customers are going to do to think about us. And so we're obviously going to do what's right for the financial position of the company. But we want to treat people properly and we want to move on and move to the future. And so we made decisions around what we were willing to do certainly with that balanced lens. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Charlie Scharf : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Hey, a couple of questions. So first off, Charlie just want to get a sense as to where we should be thinking about, where the expense improvements come from. And the reason I'm asking is, I know you're in the middle of business unit reviews, you've got new business unit heads in several places. Typically folks like that are going to want to make investments, you're not going to touch the regulatory side. So where should we anticipate you have room to start bringing down expenses ahead of regulatory framework changes? Charlie Scharf : Yes and I think your point is actually a very important one, which is part of the reason why we've been, we're trying to be very careful about making it clear that we are going forward and actively going to start to take actions to reduce expenses but we don't want to back ourselves into a corner until all of our work is done because of those two things that you mentioned, which are very important. Having said that, and the reality is that the work that we have to do the foundational work to build the risk of strong infrastructure and ultimately satisfy the work that the regulators would like us to satisfy. It's clear, it's distinct. It is fairly broad across the company, but we know exactly what it is and what resources are decked against that. When we look elsewhere in the company and I think I use the words in the prepared remarks it is we just, we have spans and layers at the company which are well beyond what I've seen at other places and makes us a very, very inefficient company. When we just look at the work that's being generated, the things that are being done, we as a management team believe that we can change the priorities. So that we're being really clear on what has to get done and stop a bunch of work that has to get done. We have duplicative platforms, duplicative processes across the company. So as we think about a series of these things, they are extremely significant because these things exist just about every part of the company. In addition, I just also want to point out that we have stopped any reductions that were going to take place just given the environment. And so there is a series of actions that we\u2019re ready to take. In fact, we have a series of employees who've been told that their jobs will ultimately go away, but we were going to let some time passes we got through the initial stages of the COVID crisis. So we do see a clear path to start making an impact on the expense base. And it's like an onion, the more we do, the more clear the next round will become. Betsy Graseck : The thing that you could start in second half, I know you mentioned that would see the benefits here in 2021 with expenses below 20. But should we anticipate that some of this will start in second half 2020? Charlie Scharf : We are clearly going to take the actions in the second half of this year, and obviously, depending on what the economics of all that is and the accounting of it, not quite sure whether you'll see it in next year. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, that's understandable. And then could I just switch gears to a question on mortgage? So the question here, yes. Charlie Scharf : I just want to add one thing which I just think is important, which is because I didn't say this in the prepared remarks. But I've certainly talked about this inside the company which is we don't look at a quarter like this and just say, okay, that is what it is. Losses are higher, our margins are narrow. We know we've got some work going on. And so we'll eventually get around to it. While we knew these things had to get done, and the work was getting done, it's not lost on us, our under performance relative to where we should be earning. And so while I think there was a sense of urgency towards both getting the regulatory work done, and improving our performance, whatever sense of urgency existed before is going to be small relative to what it is going forward. Betsy Graseck : Yes, I get that. No, I get that and I also am hearing in your commentary that the costs around the regulatory and the risk in those costs. Is it fair to say are more known today than they were maybe a year-ago? Charlie Scharf : Yes, I think absolutely. As time goes on and we become clear on what has happened. It's clearly easier for us to put a broad understanding of what that takes. And again, just to be clear, when we go and part of the reason why it takes us a period of time to do this properly is we're going to have a very formal processes in place to ensure whatever reductions in our expense base we take that they do not impact any of that work. And so that'll be informal, and it will be very, very formal because that would be just a terrible, terrible mistake for everyone if we were not to do that properly. So beyond heightened consciousness on that issue. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. Just switching to mortgage, refi speeds have been incredibly high and through second quarter. And John, I just wanted to get your sense as to what's in your base case assumptions for 3Q, 4Q. I mean part of the reason for asking is it impacts the servicing, prepayment speeds, it impacts your NII outlook with the refinancing on the agency. And then also I just wanted to have a quick follow-up question here on Ginnie buyouts that you did that, the American Banker highlighted this morning just understand is that the first of many or not? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Yes, good question. So on mortgage speeds, and it shows up in the MSR, shows up in our investment portfolio, and it shows up in the runoff of book loans that are in our held for investment portfolio, in loan forum. The speed assumptions vary depending on the vintage the coupon, the debt to income, the LTV et cetera and the refinance ability of borrower by borrower. But I think we're as aware as anyone of how fast things have gotten. And we're seeing 30 handle CPR on various pools of loans. And so while we think we've captured that in our updated estimates on the MSR in particular, it does feed into this level of call it $500 million to $700 million per quarter of premium amortization for mortgage securities, which as I said is likely to remain for the rest of the year. On Ginnie buyouts, as what's happening there is that there are loans which have gone delinquent in part because of COVID. And as the servicer, we essentially have the accounting consequence of owning them whether we buy them out or not, they're deemed because of the option to purchase them is so deeply in the money we're deemed to have bought them. And so our calculus was either to have a giant pile of cash and that that consolidated asset, or to go ahead and buy them out and not have that asset, essentially that asset twice, but use the cash to buy the asset. And these are guaranteed loans, from our perspective, not a huge credit consequences just carrying the asset for a period of time before it either gets redelivered or sold or worked out in some way. So that's why we were a big buyer in the extra that was after the end of the quarter. And then with respect to whether it continues on, facts and circumstances, the same tension will apply if we're deemed to have them on our books because we have the option to buy them, then we may and if cash levels remain where they are, then we may go ahead and do it just so that we don't really double up besides of our balance sheet and that is an asset cap consideration. Betsy Graseck : Yes, that makes a ton of sense. But so it's a function of in more forbearance from here. Is that the driver? John Shrewsberry : More ongoing. That's right. And whether we're the servicer or not, but that's right. Betsy Graseck : Yes, that's right. Okay, thanks John. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Charlie Scharf : Good morning, Ken. Ken Usdin : Hi, good morning. Good afternoon now at East Coast. Just a follow-up question on the NII outlook, it seems like in the second half, some pluses or minuses to get to the mid-zone of your 41, 42. But just can you help us understand just how much more roll through there needs to be from here on both asset yields and securities yields to your earlier points of how you're reinvesting and then what from here can also happen on the deposit cost side as a partial offset? Charlie Scharf : Yes, so I think on the deposit cost side, our anticipation is that between the reduction in pricing for interest bearing deposits and the growth or continuity of non-interest bearing deposits that our average deposit cost is back in the single digit basis points by the third or fourth quarter, that's the trajectory that we're on. That's where we were in 2015, 2016. On the asset side, depending on what happens to the LIBOR probably in particular there spreads are holding firm where we're lending hence there will be some, there could be some lower spread loan product that that is replaced with higher, you've heard about that in autos, it's true in some categories of C&I, but that's a piece of it. On the security front, we've been trying to stay invested but the level of prepayments that Betsy just referred to, I think at our securities portfolio down by almost $30 billion in the quarter and so how much more duration we want to add at these low yields is a separate issue, we haven't been adding much in credit related securities product. But as I mentioned, I think to John the outlook for NIM is relatively range bound through the rest of the year, we're sort of bumping along what we think the bottom could be. I mean, obviously things could change. But zero in the front end and 60, 70 basis points in the long end, this feels about like where we're likely to be with the things that I mentioned. Ken Usdin : Right and then so I guess then it really just NII growth next year or just you starting from a high point this year, so probably be in the hold still next year. But really, does it depend on the asset cap end or does it depend on the mix of earning assets in order to get that kind of off this $10 billion-ish type of NII number? Charlie Scharf : Yes, it's good question. It's both so it's what choices we make on the asset side and what the market is offering, where loan demand comes from, I think will matter a lot. Slope of the curve, if things get a little steeper that obviously could be helpful because we're so exposed to the long-end. And then if there's an opportunity to have a bigger balance sheet, we're certainly not budgeting that, we're accounting on it. But that that would be a difference maker. Ken Usdin : Okay, one just quick follow-up, John on the servicing side of mortgage in a great production, and then the tougher servicing results. There's both the core fees that are contracting because of the prepays. And then there's all the hedging, what's the best way you can help us understand how that mortgage banking line item just projects from here given especially the uncertainty and how you model out the servicing side? John Shrewsberry : Yes, it's tricky. But so I think what we've said is we expect volumes on the production side to be a little bit higher and margins to be relatively constant. So if those two things hold true, the third quarter should be a great, relatively great production environment for mortgage and on the servicing side, we think we've captured the higher servicing costs for default servicing, modification servicing, et cetera. We now have faster speed expectations in the model. Although we said that a quarter ago or two, we were surprised on the downside. But if we've -- if both of those things are captured, then we will produce lower servicing fees because the book itself is getting smaller. But I'll take smaller servicing revenue to as long as we're not taking big writedowns on the assets that are offsetting the benefit that we're generating on the origination side, and hopefully the third quarter reflects that. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Thanks John. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. John Shrewsberry : Hi Saul. Saul Martinez : Hi guys. Hello, thanks for taking my questions. First of all, really, really specific question related to the fourth quarter dividend cap. Can you just verify John that that that's based on net income before preferred stock dividends and because I think that the guidance from the Fed is public that it's based on why not see net income figure and for you guys obviously that does matter given the size of the first stock dividends, so I just wanted to make sure that that point is clarified? John Shrewsberry : Yes, the way we're calculating it's not aftertax but before preferred stock dividends which gets you to NII available to common. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. Okay, so you're calculating before for preferred stock dividends just to be correct. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. A much, much, much broader question and kudos on the donation to the CDFIs that I think a lot of them do a lot of very good work. And I guess on that point though, I do think that it's pretty clear though, that Wells does have to, maybe more than others really focus on multiple stakeholders and different goals. And the idea of strictly shareholder driven capital is obviously already were tapped. And you make your regulators meet their demands, employees, I think genuinely are concerned about the well being of the communities you work in. And then you have guys like me who talk about your ROTCEs and super high efficiency ratios and how you're going to right size your cost structures and I guess, how do you think about that, that that balancing act and those competing demands, I think in the past, most management teams have argued that they can do all of those things simultaneously and I think to a certain degree, maybe that is true, but there are some trade-offs and some element of some dynamic going on. So I guess, Charlie, I'm curious, maybe just more philosophically how you think about that. And I guess ultimately, how do you think about shareholder value in that total pool of goals? Charlie Scharf : Yes, I guess I don't think about it as a trade-off. And I don't think about it as something which is different for us versus other significant companies, whether you're a financial institution or not, I think it is very, very clear that our ability to be successful as a company for our shareholders includes the fact that we are broadly considering a much broader set of stakeholders, if we don't do that customers, whether they're consumers or companies ultimately won't want to be supportive of us will have issues in our local communities. It'll filter through to the legislators and likely the regulatory agenda. So I think we very much think that they are very much related and that there's no reason why the things that we should be doing to be more thoughtful of a broader set of stakeholders. They aren't a set of financial negatives. Ultimately, it should be something beyond that. The PPP fees were certainly something that was very unique. We\u2019re in the middle of this really horrific time for small businesses and especially minority owned small businesses. The right thing for us as a significant company in this country is to be as helpful as we can with that community. It's also ultimately helpful for us if we can make a difference in the communities that we operate. And then we also looked at that relative to just the what we thought was fair for us in order to participate in the PPP program. And so I think, you put all those things together and there is alignment. And those that don't think about it that way will likely suffer over the long-term. Saul Martinez : All right, that's thanks for the thoughtful answer. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good afternoon. So I wanted to start-off Charlie with just a theoretical question on the asset cap, you talked about the proactive steps that you were taking to manage the balance sheet to stay below, how that's negatively impacted NII, since most investors are focusing at this juncture on normalized NII and through the cycle revenue growth expectations. So if the Fed were to lift the asset cap tomorrow, I was hoping you can give us some idea or context around the amount of pent-up growth potential in the balance sheet today, I think it'd be helpful if you could frame the impact of the asset cap on NII or at least volume growth based on where things stand to that? John Shrewsberry : So, it\u2019s John. If just as a data point using rough math if our balance sheet was expanded by call it $200 billion, or about 10% during this COVID timeframe and there is a question about whether there was ample opportunity to do that around several asset classes but in certain areas, it certainly was something like our average NIM. The impact that that would have had on us would have been and these are approximations. But to reduce the drawdown on NII by 50%. So half of how things have worsened would have been covered by that expansion of the balance sheet. That's one way to think about it. If there were more immediate opportunities to put loans on in particular I would say in March, as capital markets were closed, I think everybody knows that we saw customers drawing on available facilities in their requests for new facilities. The bigger probably more constant piece of an increased balance sheet, at least in the businesses that we serve today would probably be to have a bigger securities and securities financing portfolio in support of our Corporate and Investment Bank where we have drawn down as part of managing under the asset cap and there's a handful of benefits to that, including being able to do more business with the companies that were and the institutions that were financing in that realm. But you also end up with a big LIBOR funded book that is a little bit less asymmetric in a down rate scenario and we certainly suffered from that. And there's a real benefit to being substantially deposit funded in that it's very low cost to begin with. But in a down rate environment, it's a little bit more violent in terms of the outcome that it generates and to have a bigger component piece of LIBOR funded assets with LIBOR funded liabilities, it's a little bit less high producing in the best of times, but it maintains its margin in the down rate environment. So that would have been a benefit also. Charlie, you may have other thoughts. Charlie Scharf : I think that's okay. Steven Chubak : Okay, it\u2019s helpful color, John. So thanks for that. Just had one more question. This one, I guess I asked over the last couple of quarters but wanted to get some context around the core fee income level or the jumping-off point we should think about for the back half. You said some of the tail winds for mortgage production. Trust fees should benefit from higher markets, but you also have some normalization of trading activity. And just given all the different moving pieces, I was hoping you can give us some sense as to what the right jumping-off point might be for 3Q? John Shrewsberry : Yes, we don't put a number on it and call it core but rather talk about the component pieces of it. And so service charges on deposits, which is a big one for us, my assumption is that it's going to feel, at least for a while, like it does today, people are spending differently. They're maintaining cash balances at a higher level. And so there are whether it's waivers because of high balances or the absence of overdraft that puts pressure on that line item as our customers do what's right for them in this environment, you mentioned brokerage advisory, et cetera that should be stronger going into the second half of the year. Investment banking, we had a record high grade market in the first quarter, so while other activity may pick up a little bit, my sense is that that probably normalizes somewhat. Card fees have reflected what I mentioned in my prepared remarks which is at least in the debit card space, we've got balances or flows in dollar terms about equal to last year. But the number of transactions lower which has a negative impact in card fees and credit card fees have been improving, it haven't caught up so that, I don't think it's going to pop back up anytime really quickly. Mortgage, I mentioned on the production side should be very strong or should be strong. And hopefully we've accounted for faster speeds and higher costs in servicing. Trading, as you said probably gets a little bit softer. And other items are less material and there's nothing really noteworthy. So that's how I would think about the categories. Steven Chubak : You covered again, thanks so much for that, John. John Shrewsberry : You bet, sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. John Shrewsberry : Hi, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Hi, I want to circle back on kind of the longer-term view of getting your efficiency closer to peers? And I guess the first question is, why do you necessarily think it's an expense issue versus a revenue issue? Or is it a combination of both? John Shrewsberry : It's definitely a combination of both, revenue particularly interest income, which doesn't carry a lot of expense load would be very helpful, I think what we're trying to do is assess where the company is today and what we can do about it. And we can do more about expense than we can about revenue in a balance sheet constrained environment in a recession and in a low rate environment. So it's actionable by the management team, but without a doubt, some amount of normalization of certain categories of revenue would be, would contribute to it. But having said that, I think we've sort of factored in a variety of different ways on the idea that all things being equal and I'm sure they won\u2019t be. But at least we think about it today, that $10 billion is a reasonable amount to go after to put Wells Fargo on a level playing field with the large cap peers. Charlie Scharf : And the only thing I would add to what John said is this isn't, the calculation of the $10 billion, that's a mathematical exercise. When the management team, the operating committee gets in a room, there is absolutely no disagreement in the room, not about the math, but about the inefficiencies that exist inside the company away from all of these risk related activities. And the work that we've been doing is to build the plans from the bottom up to identify where that is, and so whether that's the full $10 billion or not, we\u2019ll see what we get to but there is we certainly have a clear belief that we can make a significant dent based upon what we know. Matt O'Connor: And just to be clear what you think kind of the longer-term cost base can be, when you use the $10 billion as kind of a reference point, should we just annualize this quarters costs that gets you about $58 billion, you take out $10 billion gets you around $48 billion. I mean is that the thought process? John Shrewsberry : I think of 54-ish is more of the normalized starting point without the excess expenses that are loaded into this quarter for the items that we mentioned. Matt O'Connor: So take $10 billion of the $54 billion? John Shrewsberry : Yes. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And I guess just relate to that, like whenever I think about kind of cost saves like there are areas that you'll want to invest in, there is just natural inflation creep. So I mean you guys kind of opened up a little bit of can of worms on the $10 billion. So I know these are things that are tough to predict like looking at a few years. John Shrewsberry : But we didn't open a can of worms because I don't look at it like we open a can of worms, I think we look at, you look at like we're acknowledging what the facts are, which is the facts are is we compete with other companies that are investing tremendously. And with that those set of investments, the math says the following. And so what we\u2019ve been purposely having said, we're going to reduce our expenses by a certain point in time because we\u2019re doing the work to figure out what the timing looks like with our reductions versus our investments. But I think what's important is not just that we acknowledge that that gap exists, but we are proactively working to get to a place which makes sense, both from an efficiency standpoint knowing that we should be investing in the business. Matt O'Connor: Okay, all right. Sounds like we'll get some more details in the third quarter or so. I think we all look forward to that. John Shrewsberry : Thanks. Charlie Scharf : Thanks Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Hi, good morning. John Shrewsberry : Hi, John. John Pancari : On the credit side, just want to see if I can get your updated thoughts around your through cycle loss estimates that you would expect I know your 2020 company run DFAST is about $27.7 billion. Is that a fair way to think about it, and then also want to get your thoughts around the reserve, you took a pretty good addition this quarter and now your reserve is about 74% of that 2020 DFAST. Do you think there's a likelihood for additional substantial reserve additions from here? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Thanks, thanks for the question. So we're, we do the math to compare our own estimations to the DFAST outcomes, but we don't think of them as necessarily better informed about our loans and our portfolios and our risk profile and our collection activity, et cetera. So it's a useful data point. It's an external one that people can judge against, but we think more about our own experience and the scenarios that we believe are the likely ones in the world that we live in. And so that's how we focused it. With the build that we made in the allowance, I think we're at almost 2.2% coverage of the outstanding loan portfolio and of course, it's very different by loan category like it is for every other bank. I think we believe that if the world unfolds in the way that we've got it modeled and assumed in our both modeled loss estimations, and in our bottoms up portfolio by portfolio work that we will have captured, the loss content in the portfolio as of the end of the quarter, and as a result less things really lag in a worse direction that this would be this would have accounted for those losses. John Pancari : Got it, thanks John. And then related to that on the commercial real estate side, just wanted to see if you could discuss the credit trends that you're seeing in commercial real estate. I know that delinquencies in CMBS structures really spiked for the industry beyond even financial crisis levels. And but clearly, that is being staved off somewhat at the banks by forbearance efforts, are you can you just give us a little bit of granularity around what you're seeing and the level of forbearance in commercial real estate and is it seeing a greater pressure in the portfolio to forbear to given the pressure that your borrowers are seeing? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Yes, the first distinguishing point, I would make is that and I know you know this but for everybody's benefit CMBS structures are non-recourse loans. And so there's no, there's no alternative other than realizing on the collateral, there's no mechanism for extra cash flow to enter into a structure unless somebody does something that they're not contractually obligated to do to try and shore things up. And I think as I've seen most recently, the June numbers in CMBS are about 13% of loans are not current. Conversely, on a bank's balance sheet, most of the loans that we have real sponsorship and recourse and generally speaking are lower LTV than CMBS to begin with, so our actual performance is quite different. And then, I think we talked about this last quarter too, but the variation in how deep we'll go from an LTV perspective is as you'd hope with a more stable property types, we might have higher leverage and with the least stable property types we'd have lower leverage which helps a lot in a downdraft. So we have in round numbers roughly $150 billion worth of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the quarter. The biggest pieces, a quarter of that is office, 20% of that is apartments, 12% is industrial, 10% is retail excluding shopping centers and then 9% is shopping centers and everything else is below 9%. Actually hotels is about 8%, which is a volatile property type. And then among non-accrual loans, the shopping centers are 32%, hotels 14% and retail excluding shopping centers is another 14% and everything else is below 14%. There's about $1.3 billion of non-accruals overall. So that's what it feels like, we're working through these things borrower by borrower, sometimes the concessions that we're making are just covenant related. Sometimes they are real forbearance and we allow people to take a little bit more time to pay our borrowers have been generally calm and constructive. It's not a lot of panic. At this point in the cycle, the problem loans have skewed towards retail projects, many of which were already struggling and then also the hotel owners with lower capitalization. So I hope that's helpful. John Pancari : Got it. No, that is helpful. So really, you're reserving within commercial real estate or you would say that that represents the similar stance for your overall portfolio. In other words, you're pretty much finished building reserves there as well? John Shrewsberry : For how we understand the world at the end of the second quarter, yes and we think that's relatively, we think it's very realistic. I should also add that in commercial real estate and elsewhere our teams have gone loan by loan, borrower by borrower and made an assessment of where we think we are and where we think things are going. So it's not just a model set of expectations, but real, a real careful review of every borrower, every property and their circumstances. John Pancari : Got it, all right. Thanks, John. John Shrewsberry : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. John Shrewsberry : Hey Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi, thanks guys. One quick question. That's more of a clarification. You did mention that on Slide 15, that's a separate set of non-accruals were current on interest in principal. Was that referring to the $1.4 billion increase? Or was that referring to the total and I guess why non-accrual if they're current on interest in principal? John Shrewsberry : Total, the total amount. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then separately when you think about the DFAST results, you may perform better than those results, I guess, where do you take exception with kind of how the Fed is modeling your stress losses versus how you see them coming through this cycle? John Shrewsberry : Yes, forgive me if I don't, if I don't start response by saying we take exception with the Fed\u2019s results in the following way, because that's not really that will be helpful. But they draw from different models and have different approaches. And we draw from our own, as I said bottoms up, our own modeled outcomes or historical outcomes, changing the composition of the portfolio, changing the underwriting standards, since whatever we're comparing it to and we end up with the numbers that we end up with, I'm happy to note that I think in general, the Fed applies in general a lower loss rate for a variety of loan categories to Wells Fargo than they have for some other lenders, it's not universally true based on the composition of portfolios. But where we like our numbers a lot of work with a lot of very close inside knowledge of borrowers properties, et cetera goes into it and it's being compared to something that's more statistically driven from a model that we don't have access to. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Chris Kotowski : Yes, good morning. Two things, one just to follow-up on Matt\u2019s question. I mean just from 2017 to today, I mean your revenue runway went from $88 billion to roughly 70-ish billion. And your core operating expenses have kind of stayed flattish at 54-ish let's say it. So I mean, sitting here on the outside, it looks like it's primarily a revenue problem, not an expense problem. And I mean when you put out a number like $10 billion? Are you worried that that is going to like, forego the optionality on capturing back that $18 billion in lost revenues? Or should we assume that that's kind of gone? John Shrewsberry : I think you should go back and listen to the words that we used to describe what the $10 billion is and how we're thinking about this. Listen, there's no question in our minds that we should have the ability to generate higher revenues in the future. No question that will help when it comes to an efficiency ratio. What we're talking about is, if you go back and look at where we were as a company versus the others, the others that the big companies that we compete with have been working on this for five to 10 years. And there is again, I think we're being very factual about it, which you should, you should go back and check yourself, which is there is this meaningful difference between what our expense base looks like and theirs. And then I recognize on the outside, but what we're telling you is from one on the inside, that we as a management team continue to believe that the opportunities are substantial to improve the efficiency of the organization because we see it day in and day out. And we're going through a process to identify exactly what it is, where it is. It's not just people, it's the third-party spend here is extraordinary. The things that we rely on outside people to do is beyond anything that I've ever seen. Our ability to reduce facilities is substantial. And so there's this long list of things that we will actively be working on. Whether that gets to $10 billion, whether it gets to more, whether it gets to less, we'll see we're going to share more as we develop the plans. But I think it's just important for us as a management team to be very objective at what things look like for this company, before we wound up in today's environment and those efficiencies clearly exist in the company. Chris Kotowski : Okay, and then just a small thing I thought I heard John say that you're no longer accepting Home Equity and personal line of credit applications. And I mean, I realized that those have been declining categories and that they are not the kind of product lines but today that they were before the great financial crisis and all that, but still are those kind of sort of key products in a big consumer banks Arsenal? And doesn\u2019t it send wrong message to not even take the applications? Charlie Scharf : Well, I guess let me I'll talk about a piece, John can talk about his, I guess the way I think about it is first of all, we do offer a personal lines in the company because we have a credit card business. And so for us, it's a question of making sure that we've got the right product in front of the customer. And so we think we have the ability to do that. The Home Equity product, as you rightfully mentioned has certainly declined in terms of the amount of production that was taking place. But we do have to make a determination in the uncertain environment as to what is a smart thing for us to participate in along with consumers as they add risk to their balance sheet. As time goes on, if we feel differently about the environment and about real estate values, those decisions could change as well. Chris Kotowski : Okay, fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Charlie, hi, John. A couple of questions, thanks for taking them. Firstly, Charlie, are you still on track to be giving us some kind of strategic review or strategic plan towards the end of the year or should we expect that with the cost details that are going to give us in the third quarter? How you think in terms of timing of the two things? Charlie Scharf : I think as we between the third and fourth quarter, we're looking at getting both done to share the complete or complete set of thoughts with you. Vivek Juneja : Okay, so you'll do them. So you will give it to us simultaneously so that we can see how the two fit together? Charlie Scharf : Again, I think that's what we're targeting but we will have to see how it plays out and our work progresses. Vivek Juneja : Okay. In that same vein, Charlie, as you're thinking about all of this, you talk about not having too much of an expense dollar relative to your peers. How much of this way you find businesses where it's because you just don't have enough scale on the revenue side? Are you thinking you're going to exit some of those businesses? What are you thinking there? Are you thinking about more business exits? Any thoughts on that? Charlie Scharf : Yes, that's a good question, Vivek. I think and I think we've talked about this a little bit over the last couple of quarters. There absolutely are some things that we do which either we don't have scale in or it just might not be big enough to have an impact on the company going forward and it's not clear that it's integral to us being able to fulfill the primary banking relationships that we have from the consumer to the small business and middle market up to the corporate. So I think as we think about what the company should look like, we absolutely are looking at those things. And so we would certainly expect that we would continue to, I think John has used the word prune some of these, some of these things that exist inside the company as we've been doing. I don't think about them in terms of say differently. The five lines of business that we've determined we do believe are key to the future of the company. But when you go below that, there's certainly some activities which might not meet our criteria for continuing to be here. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And then when you give us these combined reviews, will you give us some sense of we've been, we've heard about your need to spend more on technology areas that you're behind them, will you give us some sense also, where that stands business by business and what you need to do and how that sort of dovetails with the numbers too? Charlie Scharf : We'll see when we get closer level of detail that we go through with you. But certainly the work that we're doing contemplates the fact that we don't want to stand still in our businesses. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales. Charles Peabody : Good afternoon. Thank you. Two questions, one I apologize if you've already covered this, but I transitioned over late from the Citigroup call. What were the variables that went into your thinking on the level of the dividend? I mean, was it this was a level that you didn't have to worry about it again, was it a function of what you think your core earnings power is going forward? Or is it is a desire to build capital more quick, what were the variables that touched you to that level? Charlie Scharf : A handful of things, of course and with the expectation that it's likely that the constraints on the calculation of allowable dividend hang around for a while, even though they may not but they certainly may, we found a level that we believe is something that gives us more of upside ability as the COVID environment clears up, as the medium term earnings power of the company becomes more known, both in terms of sources of revenue and what's happening with expense, et cetera. So that we wouldn't end up or have a low likelihood of ending up in an environment where we're making repeated changes to the dividend. So not so much about our capital levels are fine, we have $23-ish billion of excess on top of our regulatory capital requirements. And we feel it's gone up, as you may have observed, and that's even after building a $20 billion allowance. So not so much capital sufficiency, although, but in the future could turn out differently than we and others are planning right now, but really more about thinking about the core earnings power and resulting upward trajectory when the time is right. John Shrewsberry : And so I would just add, I know, we certainly appreciate the multiple calls that are going on today and it's a busy day for you all, I would encourage you to go back and look at the prepared remarks because we did walk through the thinking. Charles Peabody : Good, thank you. And as a follow-up question, there's a June 22 letter from 40 or 50, 60 Congressman on both sides of the aisle, so bipartisan, and it's addressed the Mnuchin and Powell. And in this letter, they warn of the looming crisis in CRE and particularly the CMBS market, and they asked for help from the Treasury and said, I was curious what actions you think they might be thinking about taking to support the CMBS market, or what actions would you like to see them take? John Shrewsberry : I don't know that we have an opinion on what actions we'd like to see them take. I do think that as between the risk owners and CMBS transactions and servicers and borrowers people should be looking to maximize recovery value. But the contracts are pretty thoughtful. This isn't the first downturn that those market participants have been through and my expectation is that that a lot of decision making power is going to end-up in the hands of special servicers and I don't know how to, I don't know why it would be a good idea to impose some other regime on top of that, that changes those contracts. But I don't have a careful thoughtful review of what's being proposed. Charles Peabody : Thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. John Shrewsberry : Hello, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, John. I apologize if you've touched on this already. But when you guys gave this in Slide 2 or I'm sorry Slide 3. The number of customers you've helped with deferring payments and waiving fees. Can you give us some color on the trend in terms of the applications for these deferrals? I assume they were very heavy early on and then faded downwards. And then second, how many of the customers that have come up for renewal have actually asked for a second extension for the deferrals? John Shrewsberry : Well, it's different by loan category. And yes, it's true that the people initially asking that was sort of a high point. We peaked -- Our peak was the second week in April, I think on average, we had about 60,000 to 70,000 accounts per day, who were asking, we've dropped almost entirely. I think we're at 4,000 a day for the week of late June. So if that's helpful, and then of course the extension question is related to how long was the initial deferral to begin with, and in general, I would say that, that more people are getting comfortable with coming out the other side. But yes we still have a good base of folks who are in deferral. Gerard Cassidy : And then second, John, have you guys gotten any color from the Fed on how long they're going to be supportive of the industry, yourselves included in granting these deferrals without having to reclassify the loans and put more capital against that? John Shrewsberry : I don't think we've got a specific conclusion on that. Although, we do assume that there's going to be some point in time after which, whether it's the regulators not only the Fed and/or our accounting convention is going to cause us to have to consider these as something other than a performing loan might be different by category, it might be different by regulator, but the longer we go on the greater the risk of that. Gerard Cassidy : Great, and lastly thank you again for the great detail that you guys -- given your commercial and industrial loan portfolio. And I noticed as you mentioned the increase in non-accruals on Page 17 the different categories, can you give us some color on the real estate and construction? The non-accruals went to $290 million from I guess it was $49 million in the prior-quarter. How much was construction versus loans to the non-depository financial? John Shrewsberry : I don't think I have the breakout in front of me, but I can have the IR team follow-up with you. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, great. I appreciate it, John. Thank you. John Shrewsberry : You bet. Charlie Scharf : All right guys. Well listen, thank you very much for the time. We appreciate it and we will talk to you soon. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today, containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie Scharf. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results, provide some commentary on the operating environment and our direction. I'll then turn the call over to John to review third quarter results in more detail. Let me start by acknowledging that this will be my last earnings call with John who announced his retirement in July. John has served as an excellent financial and strategic leader for our Company and has been incredibly helpful to me in my first year at Wells. John, thank you very much for all you've done. You will be missed. As you know, Mike Santomassimo will be joining Wells Fargo this week as CFO. Mike has more than 20 first year years of leadership experience in banking and finance and most recently served as the CFO of BNY Mellon, and I'm looking forward to Mike hitting the ground running. I'm going to start by making some comments on the markets, economy and operating environment that impacted us this quarter. Most market and liquidity trends are strong and continue to improve in the quarter. Despite modest credit spread widening that followed volatility in the equity markets, market spreads have continued their steady improvement since the peak of dislocation and remain significantly tighter than the levels observed in March. Corporate new issuance volume remains elevated. HQLA bid-ask, a measure of the cost to transfer risk and daily volatility have improved and are now below pre-crisis levels, and the Fed's pledge of unlimited support has improved risk appetite, tightened spreads and deepened market liquidity. The economy has materially improved due to the gradual reopening but also the significant monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as the significant accommodations made by financial institutions and other businesses. Labor markets clearly reflect momentum with the third quarter average jobless rate improving to 8.8% after posting a 13% rate during the second quarter. However, there's still a long way to go, and there remains significant risk to the recovery. The pace of job growth and the rebound in consumer spending have slowed, and the diminished pace of reopening and the end of some stimulus programs are presenting headwinds. The powerful rebound in the third quarter still leaves the economy well below its pre-COVID peak, including restaurant sales 15% lower, real GDP 4% lower, and unemployment 7% below pre-COVID levels. Clearly, the recovery is in process. And while the gains we've seen this quarter are important, the path to full recovery for all remains uncertain. Let me now turn to our performance this quarter. We reported net income after tax of $2 billion or $0.42 a share. Revenues benefited from very strong mortgage banking, and most other fee-related items also improved over the prior quarter, with the exception of trading, which while down from the exceptionally strong second quarter, still produced strong results. NII declined, reflecting the impact of the lower interest rate environment and lower loan balances, primarily driven by weaker aggregate demand across our commercial client base. Expenses were elevated and impacted by two significant items, $961 million in customer -- accruals and a $718 million restructuring charge. Charge-offs declined from the second quarter, and our allowance was largely unchanged. Credit performance across almost all loan products was stronger than we would have anticipated a quarter ago. However, it's certainly too early to draw conclusions yet. The actions from the Fed, our government and financial institutions I referred to earlier have clearly helped consumers and companies of all sizes, but much of this is ending. And until the risks of COVID are behind us, these individuals and companies are still at risk without more support. Having said that, the fact that we are in a better place than expected is a good thing, and that shouldn't be lost. Our top priority continues to be the implementation of our risk control and regulatory work, but we're also taking targeted actions to improve the experience for our customers, clients, communities and employees. I will discuss this later. We continue to add talent to the senior management team in key roles to strengthen the foundation of the Company. In addition to Mike joining as CFO, Ather Williams is joining Wells Fargo this month to lead our Strategy, Digital and Innovations group, and will report to me. He will lead corporate strategic planning, define and manage digital platform standards and capabilities, and manage innovation priorities, opportunities and Company-wide efforts to drive transformation. We added other senior leaders, including a new head of Home Lending and several key risk leaders as part of our enhanced risk model to further strengthen the independent oversight of all risk-taking activities and provide a more comprehensive view of risk across the Company. In August, we announced that Mark Chancy was elected to the Company's Board of Directors. Mark has more than 30 years of banking and financial services experience with impressive combination of business, operational and finance experience. He serves on the Board's Audit Committee and Risk Committee. In the third quarter, we also launched Clear Access Banking, a new low cost, convenient bank account with no overdraft fees. Clear Access is off to a strong start with over 100,000 accounts signed up so far and is proving very popular with people under 25, a big part of its intended target population. This is part of our broader efforts to simplify our products and services and create clear, easy-to-use and better experiences for our customers. As part of our simplification efforts, we will be reducing the number of different consumer checking accounts we offer, making it easier for both our customers and our bankers while also reducing expenses associated with supporting legacy products. We continue to have over 200,000 employees working from home and we don't anticipate this changing until at least December. Just under 20% of our branches remain temporarily closed, but we've opened more of our branch lobbies to enable our customers to come in and have conversations with our bankers, instead of just using our drive-thru for transactions. And our teller and ATM transactions increased 8% from the second quarter. Wells Fargo was recently recognized as leading the U.S. financial services industry in COVID-19 safety according to a nationwide study. This is great recognition for the work of all those at Wells who work tirelessly to keep our employees and customers as safe as possible. We continue to make significant accommodations for our customers. Since March, we've helped more than 3.2 million consumers and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees. The trailing seven-day average of new daily payment deferrals granted as of September 30th has declined 97% from their peak in early April. Debit card spend has remained strong since returning to pre-COVID levels in May, and in the last week of September, was up approximately 10% from the same week a year ago. Consumer credit spend improved throughout the third quarter but still is down approximately 4% in the last week of September compared to a year ago, an improvement from the beginning -- an improvement from being down approximately 10% from a year ago as of the end of June. This reflects steady improvement across a variety of categories. But despite a rebound, hard hit segments like travel, entertainment and fuel remain significantly lower year-on-year. Commercial card spend remains significantly lower throughout the quarter and was still down approximately 30% in the last full week of September compared to the same week a year ago. Digital usage trends continue to be strong. As an example, mobile deposit dollar volume was a record high in the third quarter and was up 110% compared to a year ago. Let me take a moment to expand on the conversation I started last quarter on expenses. We believe that our franchise is capable of earning far more than we're earning today. We continue to believe there's nothing structural in our business to stop us from having a competitive efficiency ratio, though we are far from it today. Prior to 2016, Wells Fargo had an efficiency ratio that was far more competitive with our peers. As you know, we've had to make significant investments in people and technology to address prior underinvestment in risk and controls, and also have an outsized litigation and customer remediation expenses. This accounts for part of our elevated expense base. We also believe that we have significant opportunity to take targeted actions that are focused on improving the experience for our customers, clients, communities and employees. These actions should also improve operational and financial performance. We have also lagged behind our competitors in revenue performance, and we also believe we've got significant opportunities to make substantial improvements here as well. To be clear, our focus starts with running the Company more effectively and efficiently. This includes reducing bureaucracy, simplifying our products, processes and our organization, reducing redundancy and manual work, and migrating customers and employees to digital solutions. All of this will also improve our control environment. Lower expenses will be a byproduct of doing these things. We're taking an organized and structured approach to reviewing this across the entire Company. We've established dedicated teams in each of our lines of businesses and functions. We're reviewing near-term, medium-term and long-term actions. We're already working on the near-term actions, including streamlining management ranks through spans and layers and other business improvements. Again, these are driven, making it easier for us to serve our customers and each other. These actions were the primary driver of the $718 million restructuring charge we took this quarter. These actions should reduce gross run rate expenses by over $1 billion annually. We also identified many medium and longer term actions that will take some time to fully implement. These include simplifying products in many of our businesses, optimizing operational and client service delivery, and continuing to downsize our corporate real estate portfolio. I understand that many of you would like more specifics on our plans. The reviews we're conducting across the entire company continue, and we are in the midst of the 2021 planning cycle. We need to be thorough in our work, and it's important that we understand three pieces before providing specifics to you. The magnitude and timing of the initiatives I've just discussed, where we think we need to invest to drive improved operational and financial performance, and most importantly understanding the investments necessary to complete the buildout of our risk and control infrastructure, which will ultimately satisfy our regulatory commitments. I cannot stress the importance of this work enough. We cannot and will not do anything to jeopardize this work. It is also important that Mike has a chance to review our plans, which he will do immediately. All that said, we should be in a position to provide more specificity regarding 2021 expense expectations on our call next quarter. While there is much work to do and it will take time, our ultimate goal is to build a best-in-class business and hope to show progress along the way. This includes both competitive level of expenses and competitive revenue performance. Finally, I want to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to making Wells Fargo better. I will now turn the call over to John. John Shrewsberry : Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. We earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up $4.4 billion from the second quarter, driven by lower provision expense. We grew revenue, but our expenses remained too high. I'll be describing the drivers of our results in more detail throughout the call. So, let me just summarize a few items that impacted our third quarter results that we included on page two. As Charlie highlighted, we had a $718 million restructuring charge, predominantly driven by severance expense, which drove the increase in noninterest expense in the third quarter and is expected to reduce our gross run rate expenses by over $1 billion annually. We had $961 million of customer remediation accruals for a variety of matters. The increase of this accrual related mostly to previously disclosed matters and reflected an expansion of the customer population, the time period and/or the amount of reimbursement as part of our ongoing analysis of doing the right thing for our customers while resolving outstanding matters, as quickly as possible. We also had $452 million of noninterest income related to a change in the accounting measurement model for non-marketable equity securities from our affiliated venture capital partnership. As you know, we typically have gains or losses from equity securities driven by market valuations, which we had again in the third quarter. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was near our expectations. And we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter to be less than 10%, primarily as a result of expected tax credits. Turning to page three. Our capital and liquidity continued to be strong with our CET1 level $28.3 billion above the regulatory minimum and our LCR 34 percentage points above our regulatory minimum. At the end of the third quarter, our primary unencumbered sources of liquidity totaled approximately $494 billion. Turning to loans on page four. Both, average and period-end loans declined from the second quarter, with growth in consumer loans more than offset by declines in commercial loans. I'll explain the drivers of commercial and consumer period-end loan balances in more detail, starting with commercial loans on page five. C&I loans declined $29.2 billion or 8% from the second quarter, driven by higher paydowns, reflecting continued liquidity and strength in the capital markets, and lower loan demand, including revolving line utilization, declining the pre-COVID utilization levels, particularly in our middle market business. Commercial real estate loans decreased $1.2 billion from the second quarter, reflecting weaker demand in commercial real estate mortgage, which was partially offset by growth in commercial real estate construction in categories that have not been negatively impacted by the pandemic. This includes multifamily projects and industrial facilities, including data centers. Consumer loans increased $15.8 billion from the second quarter. This increase was driven by the repurchase of $21.9 billion of first mortgage loans from Ginnie Mae securitization pools. We had a high level of these early pool buyouts in the quarter due to COVID-related payment deferrals. We also reclassified $9 billion of first mortgage loans from held for sale to held for investment. Credit card loans were relatively stable from the second quarter as consumer spending increased after declining over $2 billion for two consecutive quarters. However, balances were down $3.6 billion from a year ago, reflecting the economic slowdown associated with COVID-19. Auto loans declined $358 million from the second quarter and originations declined 5%. We continue to take certain actions to mitigate future loss exposure, while our spreads on new originations continued to improve. Other revolving credit and installment loans increased $812 million from the second quarter as higher security-based lending was partially offset by lower personal loans and lines and lower student loans. During the third quarter, we notified our customers of our exit from the student loan business as part of our ongoing process of pruning certain businesses as we assess our strategic priorities. Turning to deposits on page seven. We continue to have lower deposit growth in the industry due to actions we've taken to manage under the Asset Cap. However, even after these actions, average deposits grew $107.6 billion or 8% from a year ago and were up $12.3 billion from the second quarter. The linked quarter growth was driven by noninterest-bearing deposits, which were up 8%, while interest-bearing deposits declined 2%. Period-end deposits increased $74.7 billion from a year ago but declined $27.5 billion from the second quarter. This decline was driven by actions we've taken to reduce nonoperational Wholesale Banking deposits as well as pricing and other actions in our consumer businesses. Consumer and small business banking deposits grew $9.9 billion from the second quarter, reflecting continued COVID-related impacts, including customers' preferences for liquidity, loan payment deferrals and stimulus checks. Average deposit cost declined to 9 basis points, down 62 basis points from a year ago and 8 basis points from the second quarter. Net interest income declined $512 million or 5% from the second quarter primarily due to the low-interest rate environment, which resulted in balance sheet repricing as earning asset yields continued to decline faster than funding liabilities, balance sheet mix shifts into lower-yielding assets, including the impact of lower commercial loan demand, which resulted in higher cash balances, and $120 million of higher MBS premium amortization due to higher prepayment rates. These declines were partially offset by higher variable sources of income and one additional day in the quarter. For the first nine months of 2020, our net interest income was $30.6 billion. With the completion of the third quarter, we now expect full year 2020 net interest income to be approximately $40 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance due to lower commercial loan balances and higher MBS premium amortization. Turning to page nine. Noninterest income increased $1.5 billion or 19% from the second quarter with growth in many fee-related businesses. While we've continued to waive certain fees for customers impacted by the pandemic, deposit-related fees were up $157 million from the second quarter, driven by higher customer transaction volume. Trust and investment fees increased $163 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by higher retail brokerage advisory fees, partially offset by lower investment banking fees with deal counts down from record second quarter levels. Card fees increased $115 million from the second quarter, with debit card transaction volume up 12% and credit card purchase volume up 22%. Mortgage banking fees increased $1.3 billion from the second quarter. The 2020 mortgage origination market should be the largest on record, and capacity constraints continue to increase margins. Total residential held for sale mortgage originations increased 12% from the second quarter to $48 billion, and our production margin increased to 216 basis points, up 12 basis points from the second quarter and up 95 basis points from a year ago. We currently expect fourth quarter origination volume to be similar to third quarter levels, despite typical seasonal declines, and fourth quarter production margins should remain strong. Mortgage servicing income increased $1 billion from the second quarter due to $296 million of favorable net MSR hedging results in the third quarter and the negative valuation adjustment in our MSR model as a result of higher prepayment assumptions and higher expected servicing costs in the second quarter that did not repeat. Net gains from trading activities declined $446 million from a record second quarter, primarily due to lower fixed income trading results, partially offset by higher equity trading results. Turning to expenses on page 10. Our expenses increased $678 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by the $718 million restructuring charge that I highlighted earlier on the call. Charlie highlighted in his comments the details we have on slide 11 on the progress we're making to reduce expenses and build a stronger Wells Fargo. Many ideas have been generated with the fresh perspective from leaders throughout the organization. This renewed focus is critical to our future success, not only improving our efficiency ratio, but also enabling us to become more streamlined and agile and better serve our customers while we continue to invest in our business and meet our regulatory commitments. Turning to our business segments, starting on page 12. We continue to make refinements to the composition of our operating segments and allocation methodologies. Additionally, we're still in the process of transitioning key leadership positions, including Mike Santomassimo, who will be joining Wells Fargo, later this week. We now expect to update our operating segment disclosures, including comparative financial results, in the fourth quarter 2020 and provide full year 2020 results under the new reporting structure. On page 13, we provide our Community Banking metrics. We had 32 million digital active customers, up 6% from a year ago and 3% from the second quarter. Digital logins declined from record second quarter levels but were up 11% from a year ago. And the number of checks deposited using a mobile device reached another record high in the third quarter and increased 36% from a year ago. With approximately 18% of our branches temporarily closed due to COVID-19 and more customers using our digital channels, our teller and ATM transactions declined 22% from a year ago but increased 8% from the second quarter as the economy began to reopen and we reopened more of our branches. Turning to page 14. Wholesale Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion, up $3.6 billion in the second quarter, driven by lower provision for credit losses. Revenue declined $969 million from the second quarter, reflecting lower net gains from trading activities and investment banking fees, both of which were at record levels in the second quarter. Net interest income declined from the second quarter, primarily due to lower loan-to-deposit balances and lower fixed income trading assets. Average loan balances declined 5% from the second quarter. Revolving loan utilization in September of 36% declined 280 basis points from June, and unfunded lending commitments increased 2% from the prior quarter. Wealth and Investment Management earned $463 million in the third quarter, up $283 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses and higher asset-based fees, benefiting from improved market performance. The decline in earnings from a year ago was driven by the $1.1 billion gain on the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business in the third quarter of 2019. WIM average deposits increased $4 billion from the second quarter and were up $33 billion or 23% from a year ago, driven by higher cash allocation in brokerage client accounts. WIM deposit costs in the third quarter were in the single digits and have declined over 50 basis points from a year ago. Turning to credit results on page 16. Our net charge-off rate declined 17 basis points from the second quarter to 29 basis points, which was better than we anticipated a quarter ago given the challenging economic environment. Losses improved across our commercial and consumer portfolios. However, customer accommodations we\u2019ve provided since the start of the pandemic could delay the recognition of net charge-offs, delinquencies and nonaccrual status. So, it's too early to draw any conclusions about future losses based on credit performance in the third quarter. Commercial criticized assets declined 2% from the second quarter with broad-based declines in C&I, partially offset by an increase in commercial real estate loans. Nonaccrual loans increased $417 million from the second quarter, driven by higher consumer real estate, auto and commercial real estate nonaccruals. On page 17, we provide more detail on our C&I and lease financing portfolio by industry, including the declines in loans outstanding and total commitments from the second quarter. C&I and lease financing nonaccruals were stable from the second quarter as declines in oil and gas and retail were largely offset by increases in other industries, including health care and pharmaceutical and transportation services. Of note, 39% of nonaccruals were in oil and gas, down from 47% in the second quarter. Turning to our commercial real estate portfolio on page 18. Commercial real estate nonaccruals increased $126 million from the second quarter with declines in hotel/motel and agriculture, more than offset by increases in other categories with the largest increase in office buildings. Criticized assets were up $2.3 billion or 22% from the second quarter with 92% of the increase driven by hotel/motel, shopping center and retail sectors. The percentage of our consumer loan portfolio that remained at a COVID-related payment deferral as of the end of the third quarter declined, as we show on page 19, we had declines across our consumer portfolios. These calculations exclude first mortgage loans that are guaranteed or insured by the government, which we believe have minimal credit risk. On page 20, we provide detail on our allowance for credit losses for loans. Our allowance coverage for total loans was 2.22% in the third quarter with stability across most loan classes and an increase for credit card loans. Our allowance of $20.5 billion was stable from the second quarter, reflecting an improving economic environment and solid credit performance in the third quarter but with continued uncertainty due to COVID-19. In determining our allowance, we considered current economic conditions, which improved compared with prior expectations as unemployment levels decreased during the third quarter. We also considered that recent credit performance reflected the support of fiscal stimulus, lender accommodations and borrowers' ability to access liquidity. These factors drove lower loss expectations in our quantitative models. However, there is increased uncertainty in economic forecasts that vary widely, and future credit performance may deteriorate as stimulus effects that benefited recent credit performance come to an end. We increased our qualitative reserves, reflecting a variety of factors, including our exposure to significantly impacted industries, the limited transaction activity and wide variability and market valuations for property types in our commercial real estate portfolio and the elevated default risk for borrowers as payment deferral programs end. While the timing of the end of the pandemic and the eventual path to an economic recovery remain uncertain, we believe that our allowance captures the expected loss content in our portfolio as of the end of the quarter. Turning to page 21. As I highlighted earlier, our CET1 ratio remained well above our regulatory minimum, increasing to 11.4% in the third quarter. As you can see, our standardized and advanced approach ratios are now in very close proximity. We currently expect internal loan portfolio credit ratings, which were also contemplated in the development of our allowance, will result in higher risk-weighted assets under the advanced approach and under the standardized approach in the coming quarters, which would reduce our CET1 ratio and other RWA-based capital ratios. That said, we expect to maintain strong capital ratios that exceed both, regulatory requirements and internal targets after considering this expected trend in risk-weighted assets. In summary, while our results in the third quarter improved from the second quarter, they were still down significantly from a year ago, reflecting the impact of the economic downturn. Even though we can't predict the path to a full economic recovery, we're focused on improving business performance by reducing our expenses while meeting our regulatory commitments and appropriately investing in our business. And we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. One is on the $1 billion improvement in expenses that you outlined earlier in your prepared remarks. I realize that you're talking about a lot of investments that you need to make as well. But I'm just wondering is this $1 billion expected to come through in net expense reductions as we look out over the next year. Charlie Scharf : Hey, Betsy. It's Charlie. Thanks for the question. I would say -- I referred in the remarks, it's gross reduction. It's real. It will be there. We'll see it next year. But, we're still continuing to go through our plans for next year, and we're looking at all of the investments that are necessary, both on the control side as well as the investment side. And so, it's too early to be definitive about what the net numbers look like at this point. But, as I said last quarter, we want to show progress. And progress is a combination of taking actions on the growth side but also showing something on the net side. But, I think the right thing at this point is to give you a much clearer guidance on next quarter's call, after we finish our budget work and after Mike gets to review the work himself. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Yes. Okay. I get that. And then, just separately, Charlie, you were mentioning how there's opportunities to get more efficient. There's also opportunities to get, I don't know, quote unquote your share of the revenue. Could you -- I know it's early, but could you give us a sense as to what you're thinking about when you highlight that? Where do you see opportunities for Wells on the revenue side? Charlie Scharf : Sure. I mean, I would say, when we look at our business and put the trajectory of NII to the side for a second because of the low rate environment, just talking about building franchise and the opportunities that present itself, I think when you look at -- let's go business by business quickly. When you look at our consumer and small business banking franchise, we've been on the defensive now for a very long time, appropriately so, given the issues and problems that we had. A tremendous amount of work has been done by all the folks leading those businesses. Our franchise is still extraordinarily strong. And you see it, by the way, even in just the deposit growth that we've had in that segment, which says an awful lot about the -- about what our customers think of us. But while we had been investing in some of the digital capabilities, which you do see the marketplace tremendous opportunities to grow with the affluent customer base, at the other end, we've rolled out a product for those that are far less affluent, which is very competitive and getting real traction. And so, I just -- I think in the consumer and small business space, the opportunities are significant. In the consumer lending space, the mortgage business, the demand is greater than our ability to process at this point still, and that's still where we sit today. We have opportunities in the card space to leverage the customer base that we have, staying with our -- within our risk framework, the way we've defined it. We're just doing a better job at delivering card and other payments products. The commercial bank, I think, is an extraordinary franchise. And both things that we do on a standalone basis there as well as things we do in partnership with the products we have in the corporate investment bank are still huge opportunities for us. Our Wealth and Investment Management space, the wealth business, we\u2019re one of the few that have this sizable franchise in a space that we love. We've made progress at having the business work together across our private bank and across our brokerage business. But, we're just getting started there. And I think, the opportunities, even with the very strong performance we've had this quarter, are still extremely strong. And then lastly, in the corporate investment banking space, again, I would have said as an outsider that Wells had been very, very smart at building the business in where it has traditional strength in serving customers, and that's the path that we'll continue to be on. So, when I look at all these businesses, I feel very good about our ability to grow the franchise. And it's a question now of timing and prioritization. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Anything in particular you'd think about maybe saving to make room for growth, given the Asset Cap is kind of getting in the way of growth on the balance sheet at least? Charlie Scharf : Yes. I mean, I think -- so I mean, we're very actively looking at not below those five businesses that I just described. We're very actively looking at all of the portfolios and all the businesses below that. And we're going to continue to exit some things, which aren't core to the U.S. banking franchise that we are. Not that U.S. only, but supporting the core customer base that we have. And so,, I would expect over the next couple of quarters, we will create some room on the balance sheet by exiting some things that aren't core. Betsy Graseck : Super. Thanks. Thanks, Charlie. Charlie Scharf : I do want to just -- I just want to be clear. We're exiting them because they aren't core to serving our core customer base on a consumer and large corporate side. We're not exiting them because of the Asset Cap. I think that will help. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. That was a really good kind of overview of how you're thinking about the businesses just from a big picture perspective. I think, a lot of investors are looking for kind of this big rollout of the strategy that put some numbers and more meat behind kind of what you just said. And obviously, COVID is delaying that, I would assume. Obviously, you're really focused on regulatory issues. But, is that something that you do plan to do? And is the timing of kind of getting out of the Asset Cap, driving something like that, say, like a virtual Investor Day or something similar? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Well, I think, you said it very well, Matt. I appreciate what you said, which is that there's no doubt that in terms of the way we'd be thinking about the trajectory of the business and what the opportunities for us over the shorter and early medium term are different today that we're in this COVID environment than not. And so, it's kind of hard to have a meaningful conversation that looks well beyond that when we're far from -- through this. And so, we are very-focused on the things that we need to do in this environment to improve our performance, albeit with an eye towards making sure that we're building the Company for the long term. The regulatory work, as you mentioned, again, I said it in my remarks, I can't stress it enough. It's a gating factor for us to be able to take advantage of all the opportunities that we have in the franchise. We're putting a tremendous amount of time and attention and effort towards this, and understanding exactly what those resources look like and how that impacts the Company is the work that we continue to go through. And as I said, by the time we get to the end of next quarter, we'll give you a look -- a clear look as to what we think that means for 2021. And then, listen, the Asset Cap, I wish there was more to say about it. But, we're focused on controlling what we can control, which is doing the work that's been asked of us, which is totally appropriate. We're in the process of doing that. And there's no doubt that while the Asset Cap exists that we do have a limitation that others don't have. Others have other limitations with different ratios and whatnot. That is one that we have. And so, it is fair to say, we will not be able to extract the full potential out of the franchise until after the Asset Cap has gone. It doesn't mean that we don't have the opportunities to grow from where we are today, and we can talk a little bit about that if you want, but that certainly does factor into our thinking about what the trajectory of the Company looks like in the time frames. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then, just to be clear, in terms of kind of presenting kind of this, call it, while the Asset Cap is still there and kind of the post Asset Cap view, is that something that you're going to come out to investors and put some targets out there and again, some more meat behind the strategic update, or is it we'll get the expense outlook in '21 and a little bit more kind of piecemeal as you think about given guidance and strategic outlook? Charlie Scharf : I would expect that we get a -- that we'd be giving you, not just an expense outlook, but an update on how we're thinking about different businesses. And when we talk about the things that belong and don't belong, how that fits. And then, we're also going to be giving you at the end of the quarter when we report not just the quarter but the full year results based upon the segment looks, which will make pretty clear where we stand versus our competition, and we'll be able to talk through what those differences are and how we think about that. John Shrewsberry : They also reflect some strategic decisions that have already been made and allow you to look at the businesses on a heads up basis versus competitors, the way the current leaders are intending to run them going forward. So, there's a lot of information in that. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then, just lastly, if I could squeeze in, on the Asset Cap, I think February is going to be three years, which investors ask me like how long I think it's going to linger, and I\u2019m like, I don\u2019t really know, but there is four CEOs, three Chairs, three years. It's obviously been like a lot of change, a lot of effort. And then, there's only so much that you can share and maybe there's only so much that you know. But, like, what should we be looking for from the outside? Because cumulatively, it does seem like there has been a lot of effort and hopefully, it's accelerated the past year, but it seems like there's been a lot of important milestones, at least from an external point of view. So, what can we look for, if anything? Charlie Scharf : Listen, I think, I mean, what you can look at is you can look at the people that we have in roles today that have dealt with these issues before. And the organization today does in fact look very different than it looked a year ago or even six or nine months ago. And as I've said, when you look at the Fed consent order, it's pretty straightforward in terms of what they're asking for. The environment that they're asking for is the same thing that they've asked all the other big banks for. So, getting the experience inside the Company to actually -- that actually understands exactly what is required of us, I think, is extraordinarily important. And that team is actively working through what's got to be delivered. Again, I wish I could say more, Matt. As I said, it's ultimately the regulators on all of our issues are going to be the ones to determine when it's done to their satisfaction. But again, I could tell you, there's no question in my mind that we have a first class team in place now working on it that's experienced, many that have dealt with these issues before. It has a sense of urgency in the company, which I think is different than what we had in the past. The amount of time and resources that the senior team is spending on this is extraordinary. You'd be shocked at the amount of time because we know we need to do what's required. And beyond that, again, I can't speak for the regulators. So that's what I'd say. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey. John, just on your NII point, understanding that we're still kind of seeing this decline in loans and the premium am. Does the fourth quarter get to a stabilization point with NII as you look out into next year? And what would be the drivers to kind of put that bottom in as you think about the mix of earning assets and what you expect with deposit growth? Thanks. John Shrewsberry : Yes. So, the pieces of it are deposit pricing on the one hand, and that's come down meaningfully as a little bit more to go, but will likely bottom out in the low single digits versus the high single digits where it is today. On the asset side, yes, the softening in C&I loans in particular has been a contributor to things underperforming even recent estimates. And the question of where we go there, both the industry and Wells Fargo will be I think at the margin, the swing factor and what happens for NII and for NIM over the course of the next year or so. And if we forget a little bit of steepening, that would be very helpful. The way we're sort of looking at it, it's possible that we end up flat to down single-digit percentages in NIM, knowing what we know today. As Charlie mentioned, the forecasting process isn't done for next year. And so, there'll be more guidance on that as that comes into clarity. But, those are probably the big drivers. Right now, also on the security side, you mentioned premium am. So, we've got mortgage securities prepaying rapidly. We're replacing 2% yields with, call it, 140 basis-point yields in the current yield, which will bring down the overall book average a little bit too. So, that's in our forecast, but it's a little bit different than the -- or a continuation of what happened in Q3. We expect that premium amortization to continue right into next year. Ken Usdin : Right. John, can I just ask you to clarify? You said flat to down NIM, but did you mean NII dollars, or can you just re-go through that again, just so we all heard it right? John Shrewsberry : Yes. I meant NII, sorry, in dollars. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then, on the -- can you help us understand what a steepener means in terms of like what does a 10-year delta do to your net interest income, and to your point, about just a helpful steepener if we got it on an all things equal basis? John Shrewsberry : Yes. Well, it's -- it depends what we choose to do with it in terms of how much we redeploy. But, if you could get the 10-year up toward 100 basis points, it's something like that. We're talking about $1 billion or more of net interest income. Again, it depends on how quickly we redeploy into that, what happens to mortgage yields at the same time, but we are sensitive at the long end of the curve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Good morning. The feedback from the investor community essentially indicates that they understand that it's going to take time to have thoughtful plan, especially on expenses. I think, what's surprising the market today is the base upon which we're thinking about potential future gross reductions was a little bit higher than expected. So, I guess,, my first question is, as I take out the restructuring charges out of the third quarter run rate, that would imply $14.5 billion with elevated operating losses and suggesting an annual base of $58 billion. Is that the right expense base from which we should think about future gross reductions and also investments? John Shrewsberry : Yes. No, I would -- in our own math, we would also consider elevated operating losses to be more infrequent and not part of the run rate. So I get to a lower number on my own. The numbers -- the reported numbers are what they are and should be accounted for. But, as we're thinking about what's run rate and what's not, the elevated levels of operating losses, even though they have occurred now for a couple of quarters in a row, are not anticipated at this level. And restructuring charges -- I'm certain, there will be more, by the way, because that will be evidence that the company is making progress in its plans, but I wouldn't just consider that to be run rate either. So that would get you to a lower number. Erika Najarian : Got it. Just a follow-up on that -- go ahead. John Shrewsberry : Go ahead. Erika Najarian : Just a follow-up with that, actually. So, I think, you previously mentioned that a more normal level would be $600 million annually. And so, if I take that elevated level out, then the base upon which we would then say, okay, this is the base, and then there's further improvement from here, would be $54 billion. Clearly, different math in terms of your future earnings power. Is that the right way to think about it? John Shrewsberry : That's how I think about it. Yes. That $600 million still seems like a good number. I think, in this quarter, we have $150 million worth of what we consider to be run rate operating losses, fraud, robbery, those standard things that have been in place for a long time. And what's above that is more episodic, and this quarter had much more to do with a closure of legacy types of issues. Erika Najarian : Got it. Very, very helpful. And just as a follow-up question to Ken's line of questioning, all three of your mega cap bank peers essentially indicated that net interest income has either hit a bottom in the third quarter or will hit a bottom in the fourth quarter. Assuming no change in the outlook for rates and obviously, no change in terms of the Asset Cap, is that a statement that you're also confident in saying on NII bottoming? John Shrewsberry : I mentioned it could get a little bit softer next year. Remember that we're operating with a with an Asset Cap. That doesn't allow us to expand the size of the balance sheet and earn a little bit of net -- incremental net interest income on these extra deposit balances that we're all gathering. And so, at the margin, that could be a difference maker. There are other things that go into what our level of NII is. But, at the margin, that's a constraint that we have that others don't. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Back to the expense discussion on the $1 billion gross expense run rate reduction, could you maybe give us a little bit more detail around the timing of the realization of that? Could it be more front-end loaded in terms of the annual impact? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So, it is a gross number, but the impact will be immediate in the run rate because we've accelerated the costs associated with the actions, and those expenses will drop out. John Pancari : Okay. So, it's more immediate impact there. Okay. And then, separately, in terms of the additional detail on the expense -- the longer term expenses, next quarter with fourth quarter, when you give us more details, could we get more of the larger expense opportunity detail in terms of potentially the $10 billion that was flagged before and maybe even an expense on an efficiency target beyond that? Just want to get an idea of what type of metrics, Charlie, that you might be in a position to give us. Charlie Scharf : I think, it was -- between now and then, we'll figure out exactly what we're going to give you. What I said was that we will give you a clear outlook as to what to expect for expenses for 2021 at the end of the quarter. We also said that you'll be seeing the disclosure of our segments broken out differently and much more comparable to what others report. And so, you'll be able to see the gaps between our efficiency ratio by business and others. And just to be clear, what I said at the end of last quarter was all we did is we did the math of the people we compete against and said what's their efficiency ratio, looking at business mix and what's ours, and that's the difference. And so, I assume you all do those calculations as well. We're acknowledging it. And those are the conversations that we have internally to say, is there any reason why our expense base shouldn't look different. So, you'll actually -- so you'll see what those gaps are, and we'll certainly be in a position to talk about the types of things that we will be doing to close the gap, some of which will be in progress and others which would be to come. John Pancari : Okay. That's helpful. If I could just ask one more thing. On the loan growth front, I know you mentioned that C&I is still -- you're seeing the pressure there, and that is a big factor in terms of your spread income outlook. Can you just give us some color around what you're seeing in terms of commercial demand? And could we see some improvement in C&I balances or at least stabilization here? John Shrewsberry : Sure. So, there's a handful of things going on. At the upper end for corporate and institutional borrowers, we're seeing continued utilization of the lines that they have but not a lot of incremental demand for more credit. In the middle market, there's a lot of different stories but they could be summarized to saying that the utilization of existing facilities is down meaningfully below pre-COVID levels. Obviously, we all have the spike in the first part of the year that has abated. But in the middle market, and including asset-based lending, we're seeing lower inventory levels held by customers who would use our financing to fund that inventory. Some of those may be coming back as inventories get rebuilt, some of them may not, but it's, at the margin, that's pulling down balances. And that\u2019s also I'd say on the high end. With the capital markets as wide open as they are, both for high-grade credit as well as for more levered credit, that is replacing the utilization of bank lines by funding those things in the capital markets. And that's the story. Charlie Scharf : And I'll just state the obvious, right, which is that ultimately, the path of the recovery is going to determine the levels of demand that are out there. And you can -- while we were -- try to be very careful in our remarks about when it comes to credit, saying that it's too early to draw any conclusions, at the same time, as you look forward, as you get into next year, there will be a vaccine, there will be therapeutics. The world will continue to open, and everyone is learning how to do it safely, even in today's environment. And ultimately, that's what's going to drive business activity and demand, and that happens will be the beneficiary. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : First of all, good luck on your future endeavors, John, and be sorry to not have you on these calls going forward. But, I guess, first of all, I want to -- sorry to beat a dead horse with this question, but I just want to make sure I have a good handle for what we should expect. So, year-end results will get the outlook for expenses in 2021 in addition to enhanced segment disclosure, which will allow us to, I guess, more effectively compare you to your peers on a segment basis. And I guess, what's still a little bit unclear to me is what, if at all, is the plan to go beyond that and give maybe more far-reaching goals as you kind of continue to go through your strategic review, should we expect to see longer-term financial targets and expense reduction plans and maybe long-term expense targets. Is that still the plan and it'll be determined at a future date when you're able to -- and feel comfortable, giving those targets, or is that just kind of on hold for now? Charlie Scharf : Well, I think three things, Saul. By the way, I completely appreciate the line of questioning. And so the fact that it's being asked a bunch, I completely understand. We have a couple of things that we need to get through. We need to finish all of our internal work to understand what it takes to actually build the actions around becoming more effective and efficient at running the Company. At the same time, we're continuing to invest to both build out the Company and to do the regulatory and risk work that has to get done. There's no doubt that the environment that we're in today gives us pause in terms of committing to anything on a longer-term basis because then we'll show you a number, and then you're going to say, what's the timing. And obviously, it's very highly dependent on what the world looks like because of COVID, the Asset Cap because that obviously does impact our ability to grow the balance sheet and offset some of the NII reduction, which ultimately impacts the efficiency ratio. And so, as we get more clarity around what those things look like, we will provide more detail. It's just not clear when the right time to do that is, but we'll tell you everything we know when we know it. John Shrewsberry : One more thing to add, Saul, what you'll see at the end of the year is that the results as there -- as they reflect 2020 will also show some -- the results of some strategic positions that have already been made. So, that will be helpful at the margin. Saul Martinez : Got it. Okay. No. That's helpful. I want to go back to Erika's line of questioning on how to think about sort of a more normalized basis of expenses currently. And I think a lot of us have been kind of normalizing the op losses to the $600 million and $150 million a quarter. I mean, I guess,, my question there is, like, why is that the right number? Because you haven't been anywhere near that number for quarters and it seems like five years. And I guess, I get the normal amount of fraud and whatnot, but it's been much, much higher than now for a very long time, it has even before the sales issues. And I guess -- so is that really the right number? And I guess, maybe a more important question is, when do you feel like you'll have some of these customer or the litigation accruals that have been pretty elevated in three of the last four quarters kind of running the course and come back down? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Saul, I guess, I'll start. And John, you can add. I would say, when we look at the customer remediation accruals for both, this quarter and last quarter, they are very -- they're very discrete items where we went through all of the items that we have in our customer remediation queue, of which everything material is -- relates to prior practices that have been around for a period of time. We're working really hard to put these behind us, and put these behind us means determine exactly what we're going to do for remediation, work with our regulators where necessary to make sure that they understand what that means. And what we did over the past couple of quarters is to try and go through the entire inventory to ensure that we were current and realistic about what our actions are and what we're going to do to move these on. And so, we've done that. I wish it would have taken one quarter as opposed to two, but it took two. And not that there won't be anything going forward, but we don't see anything that looks at all materiality of the types of things that we've done. And so, we think it's -- those things are booked. It's in a good place, and we're just doing the work to implement them now. John Shrewsberry : And then, in recent years, there has been this kind of range of litigation, but there's been two big pieces of litigation that have contributed to this in a way that's not expected to recur, one being the -- at that point 10-year-old RMBS settlement where we were among the last people to be brought into the settlement process; and then, of course, the sales practices related litigation that was settled earlier this year. And that similarly is not expected to recur. So, I get your point, which is, it\u2019s been elevated for a long time. But, when you disaggregate it and look at what is the run rate in the business, we mentioned that adds up to roughly $600 million a year versus what things are specifically related to what I would describe as legacy issues, that is where the line gets done. But, the proof will be demonstrating [multiple speakers] $600 million or below will be helpful. Saul Martinez : Yes. Well, it's been a while since you've been there and you've been talking about that number for a while. So... Charlie Scharf : It's actually the second quarter of 2020 was $464 million. So, that's an example. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. But, just final one, just clarity. When you say flat to down, that's full year '21 versus '20? Is that -- because it seems hard to be flat, given kind of your run rate as you exit 2020. John Shrewsberry : It depends on what happens with loan growth. That's a good point. But, that is the full year versus the full year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, I wanted to start off, John, with just a question on liquidity management. We've heard different messages from your peers regarding appetite to redeploy excess liquidity into MBS and help mitigate some NII pressures. You're currently running with, arguably the largest excess liquidity pool of all the money center banks. And I was hoping you could frame the potential benefit from remixing into higher yielding securities. And is any of that contemplated in the NII guidance that you provided for next year? John Shrewsberry : Yes. What's contemplated is a continuation of roughly the same level of redeployment, which just requires redeployment, given the rate at which things are prepaying. So, there's a question about how long you want to get in a sub 1% 10-year environment with mortgage yields at these levels in the event of a backup, it's a problem, it's a capital problem, it's an earnings problem versus the trade-off of what happens if rates stay low for a very long time or frankly go lower from here or even go negative and what that means from an earnings power perspective. And so, those discussions, those trade-offs are measured and revisited each time we have an ALCO discussion, given what the forward look is for what could happen to rates and deposit flows and loan demand and other things. So, we have liquidity available for loan demand. We have -- we certainly could redeploy tens of billions of dollars into MBS or probably even more into similar duration treasuries. There's some liquidity difference in the characteristics there. But, I think, as you heard from at least one of our competitors, really loading up at these levels and locking into both, duration and/or negative convexity doesn't seem like a great trade-off. And so, we're faced with those same choices. And right now, we're essentially redeploying to stay at about the same level. Charlie Scharf : So, in terms of how we think about the opportunity and also how factors into the Asset Cap, so just trying to be clear about what I tried to say before, which is we have an Asset Cap that we have to live with, but we do have some room to operate as we sit here today because of the liquidity that we have, because of where the balance sheet is actually running today, because of other actions that we've taken, and as we think about exiting some things that can create some balance sheet room for us. And so, while we don't have the same capacity that others have, we do have capacity to deploy more of our capital towards loans than we've currently deployed. John Shrewsberry : That's right. Steven Chubak : That's great. Thank you both for that color. And then, maybe just a question for you, Charlie, on the expense outlook. I'm going to try to take a different tack here. Given that one of the biggest sources of pushback that we've we hear from investors is that while the opportunity to drive expenses lower is quite clear and evident, the risk is that revenue attrition is difficult to handicap and could be greater than anticipated, especially given how significant the revenue attrition has been since the last Investor Day update, recognizing you were not in the seat at that time. But just curious as you begin executing on the cost plans and headcount reductions, what efforts you're taking to help limit revenue attrition and your confidence level that you can achieve efficiency gains while protecting revenues? John Shrewsberry : Sure. I guess, let me answer it a couple of ways. First of all, when we take a look at just what happened to the franchise in terms of attrition, I mean, the reality of who we are is we are more of a traditional consumer and commercial bank and some of the other large competitors we compete with. And so, the reduction in NII in those businesses has an outsized impact on us relative to the others because of the business mix. And so, that revenue decline is not franchise loss in terms of what it means to customer relationships. When we look at the individual businesses and how they're performing from a customer franchise in our consumer business, in our middle market business, in our wealth business, as well as the large corporate business, I actually look at and say it's been extraordinarily strong given all this company has been through. When we think about the actions that we're going to take, first of all, for things that we are going to exit, it doesn't either fit with what we do or have the right return characteristics. And so, that is a -- those are a core set of decisions, which when we go through them and you see what they are you'll look and see if that make sense given who Wells Fargo is. And then, the other actions that we're taking are all about improving the franchise. We're not -- and so just to be clear, I tried to say this in my remarks, we're not going around saying, we have to cut x billions of dollars and everyone line up and just do it. It is about what do we have to do to run a better company, so that we can be more efficient internally of getting work done and deliver a better quality product for our customers, business by business. There's a gigantic amount of redundancy in multiple platforms across common products, common processes. Those are the types of things that are going to drive the efficiency of the company, but it will make us a better-run company. And so, we have an extremely heightened antenna when it comes to anything, which impacts the risk work or could hurt the value of the franchise. And in fact, as I said, the conversations around doing everything to help the value of the franchise. Steven Chubak : That's great. Thanks, Charlie for all the color. And John, best of luck with your future endeavors. John Shrewsberry : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, Charlie, John. A couple, let me just start with one clarification. Charlie, you talked about the fact that the operating losses, you've been trying to work on this for the last couple of quarters. I want to check in on one thing. The reimbursements you're trying to -- make sure that where you needed to expand the horizon in terms of customers, time period, et cetera, given that we're concerned about the run rate of this number going forward, has that been signed off by regulators, or is there still that process to come, so that there's some potential that that could change because of the regulatory angle to it? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Without being specific about whether something signed off on by regulators, I'd say that we have a belief that is by the business leadership and everybody around it that we've arrived at the right numbers that make sense for customers, put these issues behind Wells Fargo and shouldn't be met with any disagreement. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Let me shift gears. Just a quick one. Treasury management, you talk about fee revenues this time in your slide deck. Normally, you've talked about total revenues. Any reason, can you give us what the total revenue for treasury management? I know that's an important business for you. John Shrewsberry : Yes, it is. And it gets split between the commercial business and the corporate business. I know that we're -- the way we're describing it, I think, is -- there's a trade-off between NII for earnings credit rate and fee revenue. So, the way we've described it in the deck is sort of -- is all of the specifics we're putting on it right now. We can talk about breaking it out a little bit more now that we're in a rate environment where we don't have to pay customers through treasury management fees for putting noninterest-bearing deposits with us, but I don't have any more clarity for you right now. Vivek Juneja : Okay. One last thing, Charlie, in terms of the businesses that you're talking about, the operations. Wealth management operating margin was only 16% this quarter, pretty low, given what you folks have also delivered in the past. Any color, any granularity on what's keeping it so low? Is there a potential to improve that through any business changes? Charlie Scharf : There's certainly a possibility of it. I mean, it's a question of what we're generating in loan spread and loan yields in that business have come down. I think there's a belief by the new leadership in that business that there's a much bigger opportunity for securities based lending among other types of lending for wealth customers that we haven't really tapped in the past. So, that's probably going to be margin enhancing. On the core fee generation business, the margin isn't likely to change very much, given the relatively linear connection between revenue and expense. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : John, can you share with us, on the premium amortization, you guys obviously have seen this in the past and in past cycles. Can you -- and I know you said it's going to continue to be enforced on the margin going into '21. If interest rates stay at this level, when do you think it will start to meaningfully come down from the current level? And second, what kind of impact is the Fed then having on keeping the yields down in this market with their active buying, which -- actively buying the mortgage-backed securities? John Shrewsberry : Yes. So, a meaningful impact is the quick answer to the second half of your question. I would expect the pace of premium amortization to stay in place throughout 2021, mortgage securities, in part because of the Fed and in part because of the industry's ability to sort of shift and even speed up, take frictions out of the refinancing process, which speeds up prepayments. I think, we're operating at about 35 CPR right now. That isn't going away, whether it's virtual inspections, virtual tours, paperless closings or at least electronic closings, et cetera. It's made it easier and easier for people to refi. And that's going to keep speeding things up. We think we've accounted for that in the way that we measure that risk in different parts of our business. But, I don't think it's going away. And eventually, we'll have a burn out of the -- in the moneyness of the stock of mortgage securities, but there's still a long way to go. I think, we mentioned that our expectation for our Q4, very near term, but our Q4 looks a lot like Q3 in terms of volume and margin. And I think, as Charlie mentioned, we're operating at capacity, and so as much of the industry. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And pivoting to you, Charlie, I know the Asset Cap is not what I'm asking about with this question, but you did point out that you guys are spending a tremendous amount of time of getting everything right with the regulators. If you're comfortable, can you give us a time line of when you send in the documents, when do the regulators start to see the work that you've done? I assume it's already underway. But,, where we could kind of then figure out maybe the regulators could give us outside of a decision that, yes, you guys are out of the penalty box and\u2026 Charlie Scharf : Again, I think, that's a -- it's a hard question to answer. What I'll say is \u2013 so, the regulators are alongside us every single day. They see exactly what we're doing. They see how we're organized. They see whether we've got the right sense of urgency. So, they don't just sit in their offices and wait for us to send them something and then they study it and react. They're there side-by-side with us, and we have extremely active dialogue with them as all the big banks do. And for us, that's a good thing because we want them to see what we're doing, how we're doing it and how it's different than we tackled these issues in the past. My experience has been when we ask them something very specific or whether we -- when we give them something and submit them -- something to them, they're thorough but they're very timely in their response. How that actually plays out with a consent order, again, I don't know. It is -- what we're focused on is doing the work, having them see the progress. And hopefully, the work will be done to our satisfaction and their satisfaction. And we get -- and we'll move forward at the right time. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hey, guys. A couple of quick cleanups here, wrapping up. John, just on the CET1, how much does that change impact CET1, RWA, the new measurement, any idea, just kind of framework for how much that hits? John Shrewsberry : Yes. You can see in the deck what the comparisons have been for the last -- those measurement points. I mean, today, they're basically on top of each other. The question is, what happens to RWA as internal risk ratings change with the passage of time. And so, we expect to be well above our minimums, our own targets, et cetera. It's not really an issue. But if it pops around by tens of basis points or something, I just want people to know that that's just the -- that's the regulatory framework that we're operating in. There's nothing new or different about the credit risks and these loans. It's accounted for in our allowance and -- but this -- we've always been -- we've been a standardized constrained bank since this regulatory regime came into place. And now that might change for a period of time, as we work through the pandemic. But, I don't anticipate it being that meaningful. And it's the same dollars of capital protecting the same book of loans. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. And then, just one more on the NII. For the fourth quarter, is your guidance implying that NII is relatively flat to the third quarter? John Shrewsberry : Yes. It's flattish. I don't think we have specific guidance, but I wouldn't expect it to move around that much in the quarter. John McDonald : Okay. And then, if you operated at the fourth quarter annualized, if we annualize that next year and compare that to the $40 billion for this year, that'd be down mid-single digits. So just -- I got a couple of questions of people asking, how would it be flat year-to-year, like you'd have to have loan growth, right, for it to be flat and you have an Asset Cap. John Shrewsberry : Yes. They have to have loan growth or a steepening and redeployment. A handful of things would have right for it to be flat. So, that's why -- I think that's a reasonable range of expectation, flat to down mid single digits. And, we'll give more clarity on that as the budget process is complete and we get closer to the beginning of the year. But, those are the drivers. John McDonald : Okay. And then, the last thing just for Charlie. Charlie, just to kind of clarify, what you're hoping to do on communications and the timeline. So, in January, you'll give us some expense guidance for '21, once you've gotten to think through that some more. So, we'll get an expense guide for next year in January. But, in terms of kind of the further details, like longer term aspirations for ROE and efficiency and long-term cost potential, is that going to be later on, and that depends? If you could just clarify what the time frames are for road maps, that'd be great. Charlie Scharf : I think, it depends on whether -- how much work we've done over the multiyear period and having bottoms-up supportable plans that we have the confidence to share where we are in COVID, and ultimately, thinking about the interest rate environment as well, because clearly, as we think about our efficiency ratio, revenue these days has a very meaningful impact. But, as we do our work on expenses, the work -- we're taking actions. You see that in the charge this quarter, and the reserves that we provided for these actions will be taken this year. And so, you'll see the positive impact next year. And so, the actions that we're building are very real. It's a question of when it all comes together in terms of understanding the regulatory piece, the necessary investment piece and the expense cuts. So, again, I think, we just have to take it one quarter a time and understand that people want to see progress on a net basis. Operator : I'll now turn the conference back over for any further remarks. Charlie Scharf : All right. Everyone, thank you very much for the time. We appreciate it, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Katherine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Katherine. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our four quarter earnings materials including the release, financial supplement and presentation that are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today, containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie Scharf. Charlie Scharf : Thank you, John, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019ll make some brief comments about the operating environment, our fourth quarter results, and I\u2019ll discuss our priorities. I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results in more detail before we both take your questions. I\u2019m going to start by making some brief comments about the economy, based on what we\u2019re seeing. The benefits from both, fiscal and monetary stimulus continue to provide important support for many, and the additional $900 billion stimulus is an important step in helping those who are still in need. Though there was solid economic growth in the fourth quarter, we continue to see an uneven recovery and increases in COVID cases towards the end of the quarter is negatively impacting the path to recovery. Overall, our customers continue to be in much stronger position than we would have anticipated when this crisis began. But unemployment levels remain high, inventory levels remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, and confidence to invest is dependent on an effective bridge until broad-based vaccination can be accomplished. Given this, we expect 2021 will get off to a slow start, but there\u2019s great potential in the second half of the year for a strong 2021, especially if there is another significant stimulus package. Before turning to our performance this quarter, let me discuss our new business segments. One of my early observations when I joined the Company was that we were not managing the Company at the level of granularity necessary. As a result, we made significant changes to the management structure, most notably having more of our businesses report directly to me. That change also drove us to completely alter our internal reporting to provide us with more transparency into our performance and underlying business drivers and give us the data necessary for us to create plans to improve our performance. This is how we now manage the Company with reporting and reviews conducted at a business level at which decisions are made, a big change from what had been the practice. As you can now see, we\u2019ve also made meaningful changes to our external reporting with the goal of giving our investors a clear understanding of our results, as well as the ability to compare our businesses on a more like for like basis to competitors, and track our performance as we do internally. What you see now is what we\u2019ve been reviewing internally. Our strengths and weaknesses should be clear to you than ever, but the potential for improvement should also be clear. The changes go well beyond the addition of business segments. We\u2019ve reevaluated capital allocation, how we do funds transfer pricing, as well as our internal expense and revenue allocations. We\u2019ve also added more detailed revenue and performance metric disclosures to help you have more transparency into our results. We think these disclosures are an important step forward in showing you the size and scope of our businesses, as well as forming the basis for how we talk about them going forward. We hope you find it helpful as you evaluate our results and our potential. I\u2019m going to let Mike take you through the results of the fourth quarter in detail, but they continue to be affected by the ongoing impact of COVID as well as our actions to improve performance and put our past issues behind us. While rates have begun to move upward, the overall level and shape of the yield curve continues to be a significant drag on our net interest income. And for now, we have limited flexibility to offset these headwinds with balance sheet growth, given our constraints of operating under an asset cap. In terms of major business trends, corporate loan demand remains soft driven by continued strong capital markets conditions, and an improving but still uncertain economic backdrop. Credit continues to form well as both consumers and companies have benefited from accommodations, ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus, and an improving economic outlook. Actual charge-off rates are at multiyear lows, but again, the ultimate timing and magnitude of losses depends on the broader recovery. On consumer spending, we\u2019re seeing a continuation of the trend observed in the second half of the year. Debit spend is up double digits, while credit volumes have largely stabilized at flat to down low single digits compared to the prior year. Recently, we\u2019ve seen the impact of the new stimulus with roughly half of the dollars that were deposited into accounts being spent. All-in-all, our returns remain significantly below where they should be, or what this organization is capable of, but we are taking significant actions. Our agenda is clear and we\u2019re making progress, but it will take some time. Our focus is as follows. Number one, building the right management team; number two, making progress on our risk and control build-out and satisfying our regulatory obligations; number three, put our significant historical issues, including legal and customer remediations behind us; number four, reviewing our business, exit activities that are noncore and focus our efforts on building our core, scaled businesses and capitalizing on the power of an integrated Wells Fargo; and lastly, identifying and beginning to implement changes to make us a better run and more efficient company. I will briefly cover each of these. First on the management team. We\u2019ve transformed the team by elevating strong internal talent while bringing in people with the experience and skills necessary for our success. Our operating committee, which are the 18 senior most members of the Company responsible for running it, is an entirely new management team. Over two thirds are new to the Company or their role. Of the 17 members, other than myself, I hired 9 leaders from outside the Company, 4 others are in different roles, and 4 were relatively new to the Company when I joined. Each member has expertise and experience in their area of responsibility and brings a diverse set of skills, backgrounds, tenures and perspectives for discussions and decisions. Our broader group of senior leaders is also a new team. Nearly half of our top 150 leaders are new to their role from the start of 2020, including over 40, who are new to the organization. Regarding our risk and control build-out. In 2020, we announced an enhanced corporate risk organizational structure to find greater oversight of all risk-taking activities and a more comprehensive view of risk across the Company. We made a number of important hires throughout the year in just the fourth quarter, a new Chief Compliance Officer and new Chief Risk Officers in consumer and small business banking, Commercial Banking, and Wealth Management have joined the Company. These and the many other leaders that joined the Company in 2020, who have done similar work at other institutions, have been critical to the early progress we are making. As we announced last week, the OCC terminated a 2015 consent order related to the Company\u2019s Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-money Laundering Compliance Program. This is just one accomplishment for us, but it\u2019s evidence of the progress we\u2019re making and our ability to build the right risk and control infrastructure and remediate our legacy issues. However, this is a multiyear journey, progress may not be a straight line, we still have significant work to do, but we are diligently doing what\u2019s necessary issue by issue. It will continue to be our top priority to dedicate all necessary resources and make meaningful progress on this critical work. In addition to the continued investment we\u2019re making to build out the risk and control infrastructure, we\u2019re also moving with urgency, much more than had been done before I arrived to put our substantial legacy issues behind us. This includes working through our legal and customer remediation matters, which are almost entirely tied to our historical issues. Doing this work, we\u2019re committed to treating customers fairly. To provide some context, this work is complex, oftentimes involves going back many, many years and looking across multiple platforms and systems. We\u2019ve also had new leaders come in this year. And as a team, we\u2019ve been diligently working through issue by issue. It requires this level of rigor. We\u2019ve made significant progress over the course of 2020. And it\u2019s absolutely critical that we get this work done, so we can do what is right for customers and move our organization forward. Over the past year, I\u2019ve discussed our businesses with an eye towards assessing strategic fit to the Company, assessing risk return profiles, and creating a roadmap for improved operational and financial performance. Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of core financial services in the U.S., and in doing so, seek to reward all stakeholders including investors, employees, customers, and the communities where we do business. We believe our business model as a fully integrated U.S. bank with significant scale and breadth of capabilities positions us to achieve our goal and that we are only -- and that we are one of only a few who have this position but we do compete with thousands. Our strategy is about becoming even crisper about our target market and taking actions necessary to leverage our strong competitive position. We are clear on who we are. Our core target market is U.S. consumers and businesses of all sizes. We do have capabilities outside the U.S. but these activities are predominantly to support our core U.S. customers with their global needs, or are in domains where we have scale and expertise to compete locally. We provide the same capabilities for both consumers and companies of all sizes. Though the words we use to describe what we do is sometimes different. We are a trusted advisor and provide core banking services including deposits, capital, payments, and investments. Capital includes both, private and public access to debt and equity. Our scale and sophistication allows us to have a differentiated physical presence and technology platform you can compete with. The importance of scale is clear and will continue to increase. We have the right businesses at Wells Fargo to achieve our goal. Our individual businesses are strong and valuable. We have excellent individual franchises that compare favorably to all competitors, large and small. We have the products and services, people and scale to be a leader in each, and each has opportunities to serve customers more broadly and improve its own financial profile. I wouldn\u2019t confuse our recent underperformance with our great franchise value and how our business fits together to put us in a great competitive position. And then, there\u2019s the great power of an integrated Wells Fargo. While our businesses are strong individually, they\u2019re even more powerful when working together. When we talk about separate lines of business, we operate as one Company in our communities. Our branches serve our consumers and small businesses, as well as Commercial Banking and corporate clients. Our ability to support our local communities is based on that breadth locally, but also by the support and resources of Wells Fargo nationally. At times, our lines of businesses served as artificial boundaries for us, delivering the very best for our customers and clients. We\u2019re breaking down those barriers to more effectively serve our customers and each should add to our profitability and returns. We have opportunities across our entire franchise, but just a few examples include serving low-to-moderate income as well as more affluent consumers consistently across our platform, payments and investment banking for our commercial clients. We\u2019ve completed the review of businesses and are taking action for those that aren\u2019t core to our mission. In the past few months, we\u2019ve announced sales or intention to exit the student loan business, international Wealth Management and direct equipment finance in Canada. We are also in the process of exploring options for asset management, corporate trust and our rail portfolio. As I said, we\u2019re focusing all of our efforts on our core scale businesses and these other activities, which may be good businesses are not consistent with the core strategic priorities I just outlined. And we\u2019re taking actions to run a better company, which is far more efficient. I\u2019ve acknowledged many times that our returns are below where they should be and what this Company can deliver. I pointed out that our efficiency ratio is not competitive. You can now see this by line of business as well, and it is an important data point to guide us to drive efficiency and simplicity in how we manage the Company. As we do this, we will reduce complexity and risk and our expenses should decrease, even as we continue to reinvest in building our infrastructure and growing the Company. As we look at financial goals, today, we\u2019re targeting our overall expense level and return on tangible common equity. And just to be clear, we will spend whatever is necessary to complete our risk and regulatory build-out. We have started to take significant actions. Mike will share the details of our initiatives and our expense outlook, but I would like to emphasize that we will continue to be cautious about putting firm timeframes around our goals. We\u2019re making dramatic changes to put us in a position to capture our full potential, but we do have constraints today that impact our ability in the shorter term to realize our earnings and return potential or to commit to firm at timelines. We remain subject to an asset cap as part of our consent order with the Federal Reserve. And we must prioritize balance sheet usage more so than if it was not a limitation, a significant constraint, especially given the current operating environment. We believe we\u2019re making meaningful progress, there is substantial work to do. We\u2019re also temporarily limited in our ability to return capital to shareholders due to special restrictions placed on the largest banks by the Federal Reserve due to the uncertainties around COVID. As the path to economic recovery becomes clear, these restrictions should be lifted, and we will be able to return excess capital to shareholders through a combination of higher dividends and share buybacks. And the negative impact to our results from COVID is clear and will likely continue until broad-based vaccinations allow for a clear and even economic recovery. As these headwinds abate, our earnings and returns should benefit materially. We\u2019re taking action for things in our control, but we\u2019ll remain cautious until there\u2019s more clarity around when these constraints will recede. That said, we\u2019re hopeful that our actions to increase efficiency in the Company and the ability to return excess capital to our shareholders creates a clear path to a return on tangible common equity in excess of 10%. Beyond that, the ability to grow our balance sheet, higher interest rates and executing on additional efficiency and growth initiatives presents a path to longer term ROTCE of around 15%. Again, it\u2019s hard to put specific timeframes around these goals with any confidence today, but we\u2019re confident that our franchise is capable. I mentioned we continue to have significant excess capital above our regulatory requirements. Last month, the Federal Reserve authorized the nation\u2019s largest banks to pay common stock dividends and make share repurchases in the first quarter that in aggregate do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm\u2019s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. Based on this criterion, we have the capacity to return approximately 800 million in the first quarter. Assuming the Board declares a first quarter dividend, consistent with the past few quarters, under the Federal Reserve\u2019s criteria, we expect to have common stock repurchase capacity in the first quarter of approximately $600 million, including repurchases for employee compensation. Returning capital share to shareholders remains a priority. Our Board of Directors has also approved an increase in our authority to repurchase common stock by an additional 500 million shares, freeing the total authorized amount to 667 million shares. In summary, we\u2019re taking meaningful actions and believe we have line of sight to a double-digit ROTCE ratio. While returning to low-double-digit ROTCE would mean an improvement from where we\u2019re operating today, as I\u2019ve said before, I continue to believe there\u2019s no structural reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to generate comparable returns to our peers over the longer term, and that continues to be the goal. 2020 was certainly a challenging year for all, but I\u2019m proud of what Wells Fargo and my more than 265,000 partners have done to support our customers, our country and our communities. We\u2019ve begun a multiyear process of transforming Wells Fargo and I look forward to making more progress in 2021. I want to thank everyone at Wells for what they\u2019ve done through an extremely difficult set of circumstances. And I look forward to a better 2021. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. First I\u2019d like to thank John Shrewsberry for all his partnership over the last few months and wish him success in the future. I\u2019m going to review our fourth quarter results and then I will provide some information on our expectations on a few additional topics. 2020 was a challenging year, and I\u2019m proud of the support we provided to our customers, communities and employees, which we highlight on slide 2. We summarize our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter on slide 3. Net income for the quarter was $3 billion or $0.64 per common share. Our effective income tax rate was 3.5%, which was lower than we expected due to discrete tax benefits related to resolving some legacy tax matters. We expect our effective income tax rate for the full year of 2021 to be in the mid single digits. Our fourth quarter results also included $781 million in restructuring charges. Similar to the third quarter, these charges included severance expense but the fourth quarter also included charges for software impairment and costs related to reducing our real estate footprint. We also had a $757 million reserve release due to the announcement that we are selling our student loan portfolio, which is expected to close in the first half of this year. Finally, we had $321 million of customer remediation accruals, primarily for a variety of historical matters, down $640 million from the third quarter. Our capital and liquidity remained strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.6% under the standardized approach, and 11.9% under the advanced approach. Our liquidity coverage ratio was 133%. We continue to have significant excess capital with $31 billion over the regulatory minimum, and we hope to return more to shareholders this year. Turning to credit quality on slide 5. Our net charge-off ratio in the fourth quarter was 26 basis points, the lowest it\u2019s been in a number of years and certainly better than what we would have predicted earlier in the year. As we\u2019ve previously mentioned, although our customers seem to be in better shape than we would have forecasted, the accommodations we\u2019ve provided since the start of the pandemic are also helping to lay the recognition of the charge-offs, which is reflected in our allowance level. Nonperforming assets increased 9% from the third quarter, commercial nonaccrual loans increased $381 million, primarily due to a small number of commercial real estate exposures. While there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty regarding commercial real estate, the performance has been better than expected as our customers are benefiting from low interest rates, which is helping them preserve liquidity. It\u2019s also important to note that approximately 70% of our commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest in principal as of the end of the fourth quarter. Consumer nonaccrual loans increased $325 million on higher consumer real estate and auto nonaccruals. Our allowance coverage ratio was unchanged versus the third quarter. Similar to the third quarter, while observed performance was strong, there was still a significant amount of uncertainty reflected in our allowance level at the end of the fourth quarter. Just a reminder that the reserve release in the fourth quarter was almost entirely due to the announcement that we\u2019re selling the student loan portfolio. As we show on slide 6, the percentage of our consumer loan portfolio that remained in a COVID related payment deferral as of the end of the fourth quarter, decreased to 3% with declines across all the portfolios. We are no longer offering COVID-related deferrals except for home lending and new deferral requests are down significantly. Loans that have already exited deferral are performing better than we anticipated with over 90% of the balance is current as of the end of the year. On slide 7 we highlight loans and deposits. Our average loans declined for the second consecutive quarter and were down 6% from a year ago. The decline in commercial loans from the third quarter was driven by lower commercial and industrial loans as demand remained weak and line utilization continued to be very low, admit strong capital markets and soft economic background. On the consumer side, residential real estate loans declined as prepayment rates remained elevated. Lower consumer balances also reflected the transfer of student loans to held for sale. We had strong deposit growth throughout the year with average consumer deposits up 19% from a year ago. However, average deposits in the fourth quarter decreased modestly on a linked quarter basis, driven by intentional run off of certain deposits, primarily in corporate treasury and Corporate Investment Banking, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Turning to net interest income on slide 8. Net interest income declined 17% from a year ago, as lower interest rates drove a repricing of the balance sheet. The decline also reflected lower loan balances and investment securities as well as higher mortgage-backed security premium amortization. Net interest income declined modestly from the third quarter, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower interest rates, which drove balance sheet repricing. These declines were partially offset by higher investment securities and trading assets, higher commercial loan fees, higher hedging affecting the accounting results and lower mortgage-backed security premium amortization. As a result, our net interest margin was flat compared with the third quarter. Turning to expenses on slide 9. Non-interest expense was down 5% from a year ago and 3% from the third quarter. The decline from the third quarter was driven by lower operating losses and declines in other non-personnel expense including lower professional and outside service expense, primarily due to efficiency initiatives implemented towards the end of the year. These declines were partially offset by higher personnel expense, driven primarily by the timing of incentive compensation expense. Our expenses in the fourth quarter also reflected the restructuring charges that I highlighted earlier on the call. And as a reminder, we typically see seasonally higher personnel expense in the first quarter. Turning to our business segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on slide 10. Net income increased versus both, third quarter 2020 and fourth quarter 2019 as lower revenue was more than offset by lower expenses and a decline in the provision for credit losses. Home lending revenue of approximately $2 billion declined 21% from the third quarter as servicing income declined driven by MSR valuation adjustments, reflecting higher prepayments and increased servicing cost. Net interest income was down due to a decline in loan balances and lower interest rates and revenue also declined as lower mortgage originations were only partially offset by higher spreads. Versus the fourth quarter of 2019, home lending revenue was up slightly as higher net gains on mortgage originations were partially offset by lower net interest income due to lower balances, loan balances and interest rates, a decrease in gains on the sale of loan portfolios and lower servicing income. Credit card revenue increased 2% from the third quarter, driven by lower deferrals and seasonally higher spend. Average balances grew modestly from the third quarter, but were down 9% from a year ago as COVID related headwinds persisted. Average deposits grew 18% from a year ago, reflecting COVID-related impacts, including government stimulus programs. This deposit growth represents long-term opportunities as we work to build on these important deposit relationships with new and existing customers. Turning to some key business drivers on slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 10% from a year ago, while retail originations increased 17%, correspondent originations declined 33% from a year ago, as we maintained margins in a more competitive market and suspended non-conforming correspondent originations earlier in 2020. Auto originations declined 22% from a year ago and were down 2% from third quarter. Our underwriting policies remain slightly more conservative than pre-COVID levels. Turning to debit card, to both transactions and dollar volume increased linked quarter, while purchase volume increased 11% from a year ago, transactions were down 2% as customers made fewer purchases but spent more per transaction. As a reminder, debit card fees are based primarily on transaction volume, not dollar volume. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume has rebounded from second quarter lows, and fourth quarter volume was up 8% from the third quarter and relatively stable from a year ago. Commercial Banking net income was up from the third quarter, driven by decline in the provision for credit losses but was down versus the fourth quarter 2019 on lower revenue. Middle Market Banking revenue declined 4% from the third quarter, driven by lower net interest income due to lower loan balances and was down 26% from a year ago, primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates -- that the lower interest rates had on what we earned on deposits and lower loan balances. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue grew 5% from the third quarter, driven by higher loan syndication fees and valuation gains on equity investments, but was down from a year ago due to lower interest rates and loan balances. Noninterest expenses declined 4% from the third quarter, partially reflecting efforts to increase efficiency and client coverage and streamline the organization. While overall headcount is down, we\u2019ve hired more bankers in key markets to drive new business growth in our middle market business. Average loans declined for the third consecutive quarter with revolving credit line utilization at very low levels. Loan balances started to stabilize late in the fourth quarter, but loan demand remains weak overall, reflecting continued high liquidity levels, strength in the capital markets and lower inventory levels. Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on slide 13. Banking revenue growth from the third quarter was driven by an 18% increase in investment banking revenue on higher advisory fees and equity origination. The investment banking pipeline remained strong at year-end. Commercial real estate revenue grew 15% from the third quarter, driven by higher CMBS volumes and improved gain on sale margins as well as an increase in low-income housing tax credit income. The 12% growth in revenue from a year ago was primarily driven by our low income housing business, which in the fourth quarter of 2019 included lower revenue due to the timing of expected tax benefit recognition. Markets revenue declined 26% from the third quarter on trading volume -- lower trading volumes across fixed income and equities. Overall, 2020 was a good year with strong performance across fixed income and equities, especially during the first half of the year. However, our results were impacted in part due to actions we took to reduce trading-related assets in order to manage under the asset cap. Noninterest expense declined 10% from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of incentive compensation accruals, and average deposits declined 20% with average trading assets were down 19% from a year ago, primarily driven by actions we\u2019ve taken to proactively manage deposits and other liabilities. Wealth and Investment Management net income increased 16% from the third quarter, driven by revenue growth, primarily reflecting higher asset-based fees. Noninterest expense increased 2% from the third quarter, driven by higher revenue-based compensation. Versus the fourth quarter of 2019, net income increased, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates on net interest income, which was more than offset by lower expenses due to onetime charges in 2019. Average loans increased 5% from a year ago with growth in both securities-based lending and nonconforming mortgages. Average deposits grew 22% from a year ago, and we ended the year with the record client assets of $2 trillion, up 6% from a year ago. Wells Fargo asset management -- assets under management of $603 billion increased 18% from a year ago due to net flows into money market funds and higher market valuations. Corporate on slide 15 includes corporate treasury and staff functions as well as our investment portfolio and affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships. And it also includes certain lines of business that we\u2019ve determined are no longer consistent with our long-term strategic goals or have previously divested. In the quarter, this primarily includes our student loan business, institutional retirement and trust, rail and our direct equipment finance business in Canada. Turning now to our expectations for 2021, starting with net interest income on slide 16. As a starting point, if you were to annualize the fourth quarter\u2019s net interest income, you get approximately $36.8 billion. We currently expect full year 2021 net interest income to be flat to down 4% from this level. It\u2019s important to note that approximately 1% of the potential decline is driven by the announced sale of our student loan portfolio. Our assumptions to get to the top end of this range include interest rates that generally follow the implicit that are -- those implicit in the current forward curve. It is worth noting that while the recent increase in rates is helpful, rates remain below levels at which most of our portfolio was originated and that results in some ongoing downward yield pressure as we reinvest cash. We also assumed stable total loan balances from the fourth quarter with a modest reduction in the proportion of consumer loan balances consistent with recent trends. To achieve this, we would need some improvement in load demand, which has been soft across the industry for the past couple of quarters. Additionally, mortgage balances will likely continue to see headwinds in 2021, given the elevated level of prepayments, which have exceeded portfolio originations and given the expected sale or resecuritization of loans previously purchased out of agency mortgage securitizations. Finally, we assume stable to modestly improving credit spreads across major loan and securities categories. Recently, we have seen significant tightening, and most credit-sensitive assets are now trading through the pre-COVID levels of early 2020. Our net interest income expectations for 2021 are -- also assume the asset capital remain in place. Regarding the asset cap, we are focused on getting the work done properly and believe we\u2019re making progress. However, there remains a significant amount of work to do and a series of steps required by the consent order, requiring both successful execution and implementation by us, and ultimately, a determination by the Federal Reserve as to when the work has been completed to their satisfaction. Recognizing we are early in the year and uncertainties exist, the range we have provided reflects the potential for pressures on each of these assumptions. Turning to expenses on slide 17. We\u2019re focused on building a more efficient company with a streamlined organizational structure and less complexity, so we can better serve our customers. Our efficiency initiatives are designed to improve staffing models, reduce bureaucracy and lower reliance on expensive outside resources. Importantly, we\u2019re not seeking efficiencies related to the resources needed to complete our regulatory and control work, and we\u2019ll continue to add if necessary. We have rigorous reviews to help ensure that we have the required resources in place to complete this important work. We are executing on a portfolio of over 250 efficiency initiatives, which we expect to span over the next three to four years. They amount to over $8 billion of identified potential gross saves that are concentrated in the five categories that we highlight on the slide. In addition to these initiatives, we have a long list of others that are in the process of being vetted. While we are focused on becoming more efficient, we will continue to invest in our risk and regulatory work as well as to support business growth and improve our products and services. We are not forgoing opportunities with good returns to grow revenue even if they may increase expenses. We are targeting net expense reductions each year and our restructuring charges become clear, we will build our growth plans -- and as we build our growth plans each year, we will provide further details. We provide some selected details on our efficiency initiatives on slide 18. And as you can see, some of these initiatives are Company-wide while others are business specific. As we\u2019ve streamlined our organizational structure, we\u2019ve been able to reduce layers of management across businesses and functions, which has increased the average span of control by approximately 10%. Our flatter organizational structure has also given us the opportunity to reduce support function headcount and apply these savings in the growth areas. We\u2019ve also had the opportunity to reduce our non-branch real estate by using our space more efficiently. We currently have approximately 46 million square feet of real estate, which we expect to reduce by 15% to 20% by the end of 2024. Much of this reduction is due to our underutilization of the space, pre-COVID. Turning to some of the business-specific opportunities. As of year-end 2020, we had 5,032 branches, which is down from a peak of over 6,600 in 2009. Reflecting the acceleration of digital adoption and usage among our customers, we closed 329 branches in 2020 and expect to close approximately 250 more this year. We are also changing our branch staffing model to better reflect the activity that\u2019s occurring within the branches, which is less transactional and resulted in an approximately 20% reduction in branch staff in 2020. We will continue to adjust staffing in response to changing customer needs. We have also identified opportunities in our home lending and auto businesses. In the fourth quarter, 73% of home lending\u2019s retail applications were sourced through our online mortgage application tool, and we expect to continue to improve our digital capabilities in the origination process, which makes for a better customer experience and is expected to reduce expenses. As the economic environment improves and the processes become more technology-driven, we expect significant home lending servicing efficiencies over the next four years. In our auto business, we\u2019re investing in our loan origination system and credit decision tools, which we expect will increase decision automation to more than 70 -- automation to more than 70% by 2022, up from 59% in 2020, enhancing the customer experience while improving controls. We also have significant opportunities within Commercial Banking, including changing how we serve our customers and optimizing operations and other back-office teams, which is expected to reduce headcount and expenses. This includes working to reduce the number of Commercial Banking lending platforms by over 50% and standardizing and automating customer onboarding, which should reduce cost, but more importantly, improve the customer experience. Turning to our 2021 expense outlook on slide 19. We reported $57.6 billion of noninterest expense in 2020. Included in that were $2.2 billion of customer remediation accruals and $1.5 billion of restructuring charges. So, a good starting point for discussion of 2021 expenses is approximately $54 billion. If market levels remain strong, we expect to see an increase in revenue-related compensation of approximately $500 million in 2021, primarily in Wealth Management. This impact may increase if markets or business performance exceeds our expectations. We expect to realize $3.7 billion of gross expense reductions in 2021. This will be partially offset by incremental spending in a few important areas, including personnel and technology, including investments in risk and regulatory work. After factoring in incremental spending, our net reduction for 2021 is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion with reductions accelerating through the year. Our full year 2021 expenses, excluding restructuring charges and business exits, are expected to be approximately $53 billion with lower annualized expenses towards the end of the year. In prior expense outlooks, we had assumed $600 million of annual operating losses, which is still the normal amount of losses we have for theft and fraud related items. However, we also typically have some level of customer remediation accruals and litigation costs, which are hard to predict, but we\u2019ve assumed approximately $1 billion for total operating losses in our 2021 outlook. While we made significant progress on working through our legacy issues, we still have significant outstanding litigation and regulatory issues that can be unpredictable. The restructuring charges we took in 2020 reflect what we believe will be needed for 2021 headcount reductions. While we haven\u2019t included any restructuring charges in our 2020 outlook, we may have some smaller amounts primarily real estate related, and we will evaluate later this year the need for additional severance and/or restructuring charges for initiatives in 2022 with a focus on ensuring the payback periods continue to be strong. We will call out these charges as appropriate as we move through the year. We made significant progress in 2020 in identifying efficiency opportunities across our businesses, and we started executing on these initiatives resulting in the restructuring charges during the second half of the year. This is just the beginning of a multiyear process, and our ultimate goal is to improve our efficiency while continuing to invest in our businesses. Now on slide 20. We\u2019ve finished our business reviews and we\u2019ve updated you on our expense expectations. Now, let\u2019s turn to what we as a management team are ultimately focused on improving our returns. We believe we have a clear line of sight to increase our return on tangible common equity to approximately 10% in the short term if we continue to reduce expenses and we\u2019re able to optimize our capital levels closer to our internal target. After that, we believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors, including moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted, a modest increase in interest rates or furthering steepening of the curve, our ongoing progress or incremental efficiency initiatives, a small impact from returns on growth-related investments in our businesses, and continued execution on our risk, regulatory and controls work. The combination of these factors we believe would take our return on tangible common equity from approximately the 10% to approximately 15% over time. To be clear, this is a multiyear process dependent on the path of the economic recovery and requires successful execution on our part, particularly in controlling expenses as well as an improved operating environment. But the takeaway is that we believe our business model is capable of producing these returns. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Mike, if I could ask about the expense slide on page 19. Is the right way to look at it that you said you\u2019ve identified over $8 billion of gross saving opportunities and you\u2019re realizing -- you expect to realize $3.7 billion of that $8 billion or so in \u201821? Mike Santomassimo : Hey John, thanks for the question. Yes. At this point, that\u2019s where we are. We\u2019ve got a little -- probably a little over $8 billion that we\u2019re sort of working on as we speak and we\u2019ll get $3.7 billion in the year. And as I said in commentary, those savings get bigger as you go throughout the year. So, that implies the exit rate\u2019s better than the $53 billion. John McDonald : Okay. And if you think about the gross to net, you\u2019re realizing $1.5 billion of net saves for like $3.7 billion of gross, maybe 40% of the $3.7 billion you\u2019re achieving. Is that ratio of gross to net -- could that improve in the out years based on what your investment spend forecast is? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. You have to sort of think about it that you don\u2019t get the benefit all day one. These things sort of take -- get executed throughout the year. So, that ratio of $8 billion to $3.7 billion, you can\u2019t really look at it -- or I\u2019m sorry, the ratio of 8 to the sort of net that you\u2019re seeing, you sort of have to look at that over a couple year period as you get the full annualized benefit of all the saves coming into the P&L. Charlie Scharf : John, this is Charlie. How are you doing? I would also just add to that in that -- the $1.6 billion of investments that\u2019s broken out on slide 19, that does include a significant continued increase in expenses related to the risk and infrastructure build-out that we have. And so, as we continue to move forward, there is a point at which that -- the increase certainly slows. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions. One, Charlie, you walked through the businesses that you have sold or are in the process of contemplating selling. Should we take that to mean that that\u2019s the full extent of what you\u2019re looking to do with the business model at this stage and that there\u2019s anything else beyond those areas are not being contemplated for sale, or maybe just give us some color on that? And then, how you identified what to keep, like what was the bar for sale versus retain? Charlie Scharf : Sure. Yes. I think the answer is yes. You should look at this as the complete list with the one aside that all companies should always relook at this on a regular basis to make sure that whatever assumptions you made are accurate. But, we\u2019ve gone through an exhaustive review of everything that we do business by business at a level of detail well beyond the level that we report publicly. We\u2019ve come up with these activities. We\u2019ve thought about a whole bunch of other things. And so, this is the list that we\u2019re actively working on, and we feel very good about everything else. As we think about the lens that we use, it starts with -- we look at the core customer base that we want to serve. And is it part of our capabilities that we have either targeted towards that customer base, or are they part of a package that\u2019s logically offered to customers as one? Also look at risk returns. I would just make a comment on risk returns because I\u2019ve heard a little -- people talking about this a little bit. It\u2019s -- we\u2019re not looking at the risk return of a given quarter. We\u2019re looking at the risk return over a much longer life cycle of these businesses. And so, you add that together and the businesses that we\u2019re exiting, they are perfectly good businesses and the things that we\u2019re thinking about, there\u2019s certainly -- the question is are they best housed within Wells Fargo? And so, we think the answer is probably best housed someplace else. There are different ways to get there and different arrangements that we can have with folks in terms of what that means. But again, I do feel very good at this point that we\u2019ve looked across the enterprise. Betsy Graseck : And then, you\u2019ve outlined where there\u2019s been a pullback in loan balances or earning assets because of these exits. But what do you do with that opportunity there? I mean, there\u2019s a lot of discussion, as you well know, about the asset cap and it\u2019s hard to know when you get out of it, but are you creating room for your core businesses to grow into that space, or how are you thinking about that? Charlie Scharf : Yes. I guess, I would start with we did not approach this exercise with we have to sell businesses to create room under the asset cap. It was really the view was driven by what we think actually belongs within Wells Fargo for the long term. To the extent that it helps us with the asset cap, that\u2019s certainly a benefit. But that was not the lens with which we view this. When you look at what we\u2019ve done, the education finance business is roughly $10 billion or so in assets. The things that we\u2019ve announced, that is the most significant piece. And so, sure, there\u2019s no -- over time, creates the ability for us to redeploy that capacity elsewhere. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then, just lastly, on the tax rate. I think you mentioned this year it\u2019s going to be single digits. Can you speak to what\u2019s driving that and what your sustainable tax rate is? And also, is there a difference throughout the year like how that tax rate? Is it single digits throughout, or is it just starts super low and then goes up to normalize by 4Q? Help us think through the seasonality there. Mike Santomassimo : Hey Betsy, it\u2019s Mike. Yes. It bumps around a little bit based on earnings and what\u2019s in the quarter. But I think the simple way to think about why it\u2019s lower than kind of the past is we\u2019ve got a significant amount of investments that are multiyear investments in -- whether it\u2019s low income housing, other renewable energy that create tax credits. And those tax credits are what\u2019s driving -- what\u2019s offsetting sort of the normal statutory tax rates that we\u2019d have. It\u2019s no more complicated than that. And so, as you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years, those have increased a bit over time. And so, as we sort of look for -- look at 2021, that\u2019s the big driver. Betsy Graseck : The sustainability -- yes, go ahead, sorry. Charlie Scharf : I was going to say, so the dollar impact of those is up a little bit, but obviously has a much bigger impact on the rate when you\u2019re earning less. Betsy Graseck : Right. So, I mean as you learn more, obviously your tax rate will bleed higher, but for a good reason. Charlie Scharf : Correct, correct. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Coming back to your slide 20, just wondering, I know that that -- it\u2019s a path and it\u2019s a hypothetical and that long-term ROE is a long ways away. But on that interim step, the 10%, do you have a way of helping us think about what type of time frame might be possible to even get to that middle step, that 10%? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I think, -- hey Ken, how are you. I think, the way we\u2019re trying to describe it is that is where we have clear line of sight. So, when we look at the impact of expenses, these are actions that we are actively taking. But, we\u2019re also -- in order to get to 10% without any changes to the revenue equation at this point, we also have optimized capital levels, which means that the Fed would have to relax restrictions. And so, the reason why we\u2019re not talking about the time frame is because we don\u2019t know when that will happen. But, the amount of excess capital that we have, as you know, is extraordinarily significant. And we\u2019re also in the position of not being able to use it because we have the balance sheet limit. And so, the timing is dependent on that. But again, in our minds, very clear line of sight when that occurs to be able to get there in a relatively short time frame. And then, on the longer term piece, which you didn\u2019t ask about, again there are two, I think there\u2019s some words off on the right hand side. But again, I would not describe this as a -- as just something that we\u2019re dreaming about. When we look at what is possible with modest balance sheet growth, really moderate increases in the rate curve or steepening and efficiencies that we believe we can get, we really do believe that that is what we will achieve. It\u2019s just -- we\u2019re just not in a position to put timing around it because we don\u2019t control the timing on most of those items. But when those things become clear, we should be in a position to be clear with you about timing. Ken Usdin : Yes. And on a follow-up to the capital and then the potential business sales, how do we get a sense of what earnings might potentially go away with those business sales? And then, if you were to get gains on those business sales, is that capital also kind of contemplated in these ROE improvements, or would that be extra or incremental use to -- at that point, you\u2019re able to do something with the capital generated to offset some of the lost earnings? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I think, a couple of things. So, it\u2019s Mike, Ken. Thanks for the question. I think, we\u2019ll give you more detail as sort of we announce plans for each of the businesses. But think of the revenue impacted by the four things Charlie sort of outlined as very low single digits, around a few percent of revenue. And we\u2019ll sort of give you more clarity as sort of they come -- the plans come into focus with the timing. And I think, you\u2019re right. As we -- if we book gains, as we sort of divest of items, that\u2019s helpful from a capital perspective that can either get redeployed in the business or through buyback capacity. Charlie Scharf : And this is Charlie. Let me just add. Given what we\u2019ve announced, those are announced transactions, not closed. So, it will take a period of time for these things to close. So, once you factor into certainly what will impact 2021, it\u2019s a smaller amount. And we\u2019re working hard at making sure that when we exit businesses, we get the expenses out. It obviously frees up capital that we have invested in those businesses as well as the games. And so, you put those things together. And that\u2019s why we don\u2019t think of the impact of these things as being material to either a plus or minus on what it means for our ratios. But, it cleans up the Company, it gets us focused on making sure that we\u2019re putting resources towards the right things, and we\u2019ve just got the Company set up properly going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, I wanted to start off with a question on the NII guidance. What are some of the assumptions informing the lower and upper bound of the guidance range for \u201821? And maybe more specifically, where are you reinvesting today versus the back book yield of 196 basis points? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Hey Steven, it\u2019s Mike. Look, I think, as you sort of think about the top end of the range, we\u2019re assuming roughly the implied forward curve, even though that\u2019s bumping around day by day, week by week here over the last couple of weeks. So, assume -- we\u2019re not assuming much improvement from where it is relative to get to the top of the range. We\u2019re assuming loan balances are, in total, roughly flat. We\u2019ll see some declines we think on the consumer side, particularly in the mortgage book, as we go into this year. But we will -- and so, we\u2019ll need to see a little bit of growth in commercial and corporate side to get there. And then, we\u2019re assuming spreads are about where they are relative to the other asset classes that we would invest in, and then, a very modest expansion of the securities portfolio, but not very big. So further steepening of the curve kind of increases overall sort of are positive relative to our assumptions. I think, the biggest sort of downside risk is what happens to loans, loan growth, particularly on the commercial and corporate side. But, a lot of the activity we\u2019re seeing from stimulus and what the potential could be in terms of the recovery, particularly in the latter part of the year should be constructive for that. So, I think it\u2019s not a Herculean task to sort of get to the top end of the range, but it does require a little bit of growth from -- in the loan book from where we are today. And then, maybe just, I guess related, I\u2019ll give you a little sense of how mortgage -- the mortgage market is sort of doing in the first quarter. We are -- we did have -- the last couple of quarters have been pretty strong for origination -- in the mortgage origination market. And as we sort of see the first couple of weeks of January, it\u2019s still pretty strong relative to both volume and margin on that balance. So, that should be also constructive as we sort of look into Q1. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great color, Mike. And just for my follow-up on capital, you mentioned that you\u2019re running with significant excess capital. The strategic actions have been outlined should significantly derisk the overall loan portfolio. And just given your strong CCAR track record and these derisking efforts, is there room to manage to a lower target versus the 10.5% internal objective? I know you\u2019re running above that. It just feels like that might be a little bit too conservative, given all the actions that you\u2019ve taken. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I mean that\u2019s certainly something we think about a lot, Steve, in terms of what\u2019s the optimal level to run. I think, publicly, we said it\u2019s around 10%. And as you noted, we\u2019re running well above that target. So, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll keep in mind. But, as you know, we\u2019ve been restricted from returning a lot of that back to shareholders at this point. And we always start the conversation first with ensuring that we\u2019re allocating enough capital to grow the underlying businesses and invest in them with inside the Company. And at this point, we\u2019re just restricted from returning. So hope that that will change over time. Charlie Scharf : And then, this is Charlie. If I could just add, when we think about the conservative capital position that we completely agree with and as we look at our performance over time, as CCAR does, that does allow us to rethink about what you\u2019re talking about. You also -- we also think about just the position that we have with our allowance for credit losses. And so, we\u2019re seeing what everyone else is seeing, which is that the performance is substantially better than we would have thought when we went into this, and when a lot of those CECL reserves were established. But we\u2019ve also -- when asked -- we\u2019ve been very clear in terms of what it takes to start to use that, which is we\u2019d like to see something, which we really do believe is more sustained and more equitable recovery because so many uncertainties exist. So, everything that we see is extremely positive. But, we think the right thing to do is to be prudent there. And so, overall, the only -- really the only meaningful reserves that we reversed were because of the student loan sale, which we had to do. But that positions us from just a quality of balance sheet perspective even stronger going into 2021. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : I guess I wanted to revert back to that $8 billion plus of potential gross savings in the slide deck. Would you say, are you guys kind of completely done with the reviews that got you to that $8 billion number, or to what extent are those ongoing? I noticed one of the sub-bullets talks about formalizing a program for additional feedback. And I guess, the context of the question is, in the past, you guys have noted that $10 billion number as sort of a kind of a guidepost that would have gotten you towards peer efficiency. So, just trying to sort of square the two together, if $8 billion is sort of all there is or if there\u2019s more as time unfolds? Charlie Scharf : Sure. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. I think, we\u2019re actually talking about slightly different things. And so, let me just try and walk through what I mean by that. The $10 billion that I referenced on the call was just the very simple math of our efficiency ratio versus our competitors, to say that that is the difference in efficiency between -- with which we run the company and they run the company. And when we look at what Wells is, we don\u2019t believe that there\u2019s any meaningful difference why that should be different. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to get to that number in a short period of time because these efficiencies take a long time to build in. They\u2019re based upon both expense levels, but also the revenue levels that other people have. And so, that was what the math is. But it certainly served as a guidepost for us to sit and say, hey, why are others where they are versus where we are? And we didn\u2019t look at it just overall. We looked at it by business. And again, as I mentioned in my comments, now you\u2019ve got the ability to do more direct comparisons by business, so you can see a little bit more of what we\u2019ve seen. So, the $8 billion reference is what we have -- are the list of initiatives that we have that are in progress of moving forward with. It\u2019s a -- as these slides mentioned, it says they\u2019re 250 and plus, there really are a list of 250 initiatives that we go through as an operating committee and each operating committee member is in the process of executing on which we believe we will be able to reduce on a gross basis, the expense base by $8 billion. Away from that, we\u2019re not done. We still -- first of all, it\u2019s like peeling an onion back. And so, once you get a series of efficiencies, it helps you look at everything else that\u2019s left as well. And so, we\u2019re confident that there\u2019ll be more after that, which will help continue this multiyear drive to get to what we think is a reasonable efficiency level. Over a period of time to be comparable with our competitors, first of all, it took them years to get there. And so, that\u2019s why it will take us a fair amount of time as well. We\u2019ll accomplish a lot of it through expenses. But, we certainly need a higher net interest income, and some growth in our noninterest income expenses would certainly help us there. So, I still think of efficiency as something longer term that as we focus on just getting the expenses out and focusing on returns, our efficiency ratio will naturally become more competitive as opposed to a specific target in a specific year. Scott Siefers : Yes. Okay. That\u2019s good context, and I appreciate that. And then separately, just as it relates to the asset cap, so under the new business line reporting, a lot of this becomes a bit more self evident. So, I appreciate that. But just as you guys look at it on a day-to-day basis, what is the asset cap doing to your ability to retract and attain customers at this point? I feel like all this excess liquidity in the form of deposits that\u2019s washed into the system over the past 9 or 10 months has just been such an embarrassment of money for the industry. But unfortunately, you guys have just a company-specific hurdle in having to manage that dollar amount. So, as it relates to sort of customer interface with existing ones and potential ones, how is the cap impacting things at this point? Charlie Scharf : Yes. So, let me start and then Mike can certainly pick up. I think, first of all, we -- I think, the way you asked the question is a good and interesting one, and we need to separate the conversation about the asset cap between impacting our financial performance and impact on the franchise. And there is no question that the impact on our financial performance is material in this environment, right? When you just look at -- well, I\u2019d say when we look at actions that we\u2019ve had to take to prioritize balance sheet usage in an environment where certainly early on, there were significant draws and then those were seated with people\u2019s ability to refinance elsewhere. But deposit inflows or having to manage to those things certainly has been a cost to us. And then, I would certainly also add to that, as we think about additional stimulus, we need to create room on the balance sheet to be able to deal with that stimulus, be it fiscal or monetary. And so, even versus where our balance sheet was running when we went into the pandemic, just because of this environment, we have to manage it lower in addition to the specific actions that we\u2019ve had to take because of the requests that we\u2019ve had, both on the asset and the liability side for management of the balance sheet. Then, we also think about when we went through the crisis, the ability to add higher yielding assets when we were focused on staying below an asset cap is something that we were not able to do that others are able to do. And then, you look at our need not just to keep the balance sheet flat but to have it be incrementally lower to create the capacity versus others\u2019 ability to increase it. You add those things together. And financially, in this environment, there\u2019s no doubt that it is a really meaningful drag on our ability to offset certainly NII. In terms of franchise, which is a separate question, as we\u2019ve gone through the exercise, which we were doing daily, and now we don\u2019t do as closely daily but we do do it regularly, the conversation that we have is all around where can we make changes or create capacity, which has the least franchise impact? So, if you look at what we\u2019ve done, we\u2019re not limiting our consumer deposits, and we\u2019ve seen very, very strong growth there. We have pulled back on our nonconforming corresponding business for a period of time. We think when we turn that back on, if we\u2019re the right provider at the right price, then we\u2019ll be in the market for that. Certainly, on our wholesale businesses, they\u2019ve been more impacted by actions that we\u2019ve taken. I think, on the commercial side, we try to be very, very smart. I don\u2019t say we -- I mean, the team there, Perry and the team is trying to be very smart about operational versus nonoperational where our customers have other choices and they understand the position that we\u2019re in and the same thing on the Corporate Investment Banking side. So, that\u2019s just a very long way of saying, I think that we\u2019ve done a very good job of having as little franchise impact as possible. Hard to say nothing, but I think the places that we\u2019ve gone are places where people have the sophistication to understand why we\u2019re doing. We continue to do the other business with them. And it\u2019s something that we continue to obviously be really thoughtful about. Mike, anything else you\u2019d add? Mike Santomassimo : No. I think that\u2019s right. And just to kind of underline what Charlie said on the consumer side is that we\u2019re not putting any kind of restrictions there. And I think that we\u2019re seeing almost a 20% increase in deposit -- in consumer deposits. And I think that\u2019s a good a good sign of how people feel about us and doing more with us. And so, I think that\u2019s encouraging to see on the consumer business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Two quick questions. First one on the reserve. I noticed that you said they had the reserve release where they\u2019ve related to student lending this quarter. But I guess if you think about the reserve and where it stands as of year-end, I mean if you could equate that relative, it seems like you reserve for something worse than the base case. I mean, if we move to a base case, we\u2019re now seeing return to kind of a normal. I mean how much does that imply for potential reserve release relative to what you had at year-end? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I mean, Brian, I think, as you sort of think about the reserve levels, I think for anybody, given the way the accounting standard works, you\u2019re not necessarily reserved just for a base case, right? You reserved for a whole number of scenarios that could potentially play out that are far worse potentially than a base case scenario. And so, -- and that\u2019s kind of where we are today. As you sort of look forward -- I think, as we sort of see the path of the recovery, I think we\u2019re hopeful that all the stimulus and support that the government has been putting in, in its many different ways and potential for more of that should help provide a good bridge to the other side. And as Charlie said, I think if that\u2019s the case, I think we\u2019re -- we feel that we\u2019re very conservatively accrued for that kind of positive outcome. But I think -- and we\u2019ll see how it plays out over the next couple of quarters. Charlie Scharf : And the only thing I\u2019d add, I mean, it\u2019s just when you wind up quarter-over-quarter, our allowance to loans is -- as a percentage basis is the same. And we sit here today and we say the performance continues to be better than expected, which would suggest we feel even better about the level of reserving. But again, we\u2019re just -- given the unknowns, we think it\u2019s a good position to be in and a prudent thing to do, but we certainly feel better off quarter-by-quarter. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then, just a separate question on those selected efficiency initiatives that you outlined on slide 18. Could you just kind of walk through, which ones are the biggest impact to the overall expense savings? I know you had five different ones kind of summarized there, but what\u2019s like the number one, number two with regards to potential expense saves? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I would bring it back to page 17 in the presentation. On the right hand side, we\u2019ve dimensioned the percentage that each of the categories contribute to the $8 billion, Brian. So, I think that will probably give you a good sense of where the most impact is coming from. And really, the things that we\u2019re doing across the Company in terms of really streamlining the structure and finding ways to optimize are the biggest single piece, but it impacts many of -- most groups across the Company. And then, as you sort of look at the other categories, it\u2019s -- they\u2019re somewhat comparable relative -- on a relative basis in terms of their contribution. So, you can see what that looks like. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: One nitpicky question and one bigger picture. First one, the nitpicky. When we look at that path to the 10% short-term ROTCE, using the fourth quarter as a base, you obviously had a very low tax rate. I think, it\u2019s about 3%. And if we strip out the reserve release, it\u2019s about 25 basis points charge-offs. So, that 10% kind of ROTCE in the short term, whenever that is, is that kind of dependent on still unusually low tax rate and reserve release, or is that really driven by the incremental expenses beyond what you\u2019ve laid out, and obviously, the capital too? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No, it\u2019s a good question. Look, as we sort of look forward, I think, the -- as you think about the different components of what you walked through, I think, the -- as we said it for 2021, the tax rate is going to be sort of in mid-single-digits. And so, you get a sense of how we think -- how sustainable that is for a little while. And really, the big drivers here though are going to be driving the expense down as we sort of outlined and really getting the annualized benefits of all the stuff we\u2019re doing today and the stuff that will have more impact in 2022. And then, obviously, we\u2019ve got the restrictions lifted on the buyback. So, I wouldn\u2019t over-index on sort of the one-timers that you see in the quarter because the reserve releases are offset by some of the restructuring charges and other things that you sort of look that are embedded in that 8%. Charlie Scharf : The only thing I would add is just being very thoughtful about it is, as Mike said, I think, there are lots of pluses and minuses, we could go through each of them, and we think -- and we do think it is a reasonable starting point. But, the thing I would add is, we obviously at this point have really detailed plans as we look into 2021 by quarter and for the full year and do feel very good about that as a starting point. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then, the bigger picture question and there is probably no super tactful way to ask this, but you\u2019ve assumed at least here for the targets and guidance, no lifting of the asset cap this year. And it seemed like that was being telegraphed by some of the media articles in recent months. But, I guess if we do kind of look out a year from now and the asset cap hasn\u2019t been lifted, would that be disappointing to you, Charlie? And I appreciate that it will be a little over two years you\u2019ve been here, but at the same time, it takes time to build a management team, and there\u2019s been COVID, which your firm and the banks in general have done a lot of things for employees, a lot of things for customers, and that can be distracting. So, I know there\u2019s some puts and takes, but a lot of us on kind of the investor and sell side obviously look at the asset cap being in place for quite some time. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re impatient and we\u2019re all impatient too. So, how would you feel a year from now if it\u2019s still here? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Matt, listen, It\u2019s a very, very tactful way of asking the question of when we think the asset cap will be lifted, which you know that I\u2019m not in a position to answer. And so, I think, your sentiments are right about what it takes, it takes time, it takes a management team. I think what I\u2019ll say, if you look at the remarks that we made in the prepared part of the call, the words are very carefully chosen. And so, we do believe that we\u2019re making progress. As I even work broadly, I feel great about the team we have in place, our understanding of what has to get done for this consent order and for the others. As I said, I made the statement, I do believe that we\u2019re making progress. But, if you look at the words that are required in the consent order, they\u2019re really clear, which is execute and implement that, and we\u2019ve got significant work to do. And I can\u2019t share with you. I wish -- I believe and I understand why you\u2019re asking. I said this last quarter, too. I really do. I wish I could share with you the specifics of what the plan is. I can\u2019t do that. And ultimately, it\u2019s up to the FRB anyway. So, I really -- I\u2019m just not in a position to put the time frame around it, other than I feel very confident that we know what has to get done and we\u2019re moving forward. And I wish I could be more specific than that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Charlie, sorry to hop right back to the asset cap. But one more thing on that. I wanted to see if you can let us know. I know part of that process is the third-party review. Are you able to let us know if you\u2019re yet at that stage of the third-party review for the consent order that includes the asset cap? Charlie Scharf : I really can\u2019t. I\u2019m just -- again, we\u2019re not in a position because of CSI to be able to talk about where we stand, the progress, where we are along that continuum. Again, I just -- I go back -- I wish I could say more, I go back to the words. I do believe that we\u2019re making progress. As I said, it\u2019s really clear what we have to do. I think, we have people that don\u2019t just understand what needs to be done but are capable of adopting and implementing, which is what\u2019s required for the third-party review once -- at the point at which the Fed ultimately accepts the -- or just chooses to accept. And that\u2019s really all I could say at this point. John Pancari : That\u2019s helpful. All right. Thank you. And then, separately, on the expense front, the $8 billion in cost saves, does that already reflect the real estate rationalization, the 15% to 20% reduction that you mentioned? I know you cited on the slide around the expense efforts, but I\u2019m not sure does it reflect that whole rationalization? Because that\u2019s a fairly substantial cut to your real estate footprint. Charlie Scharf : Yes. The bulk of it\u2019s included in the $8 billion number that we gave you, so. John Pancari : Okay. One more thing on that. Regarding the cadence of the remaining $4.3 billion of that $8 billion beyond 2021, I know you indicated be over several years. Is that still going to be more front-end loaded, meaning could the savings realized in 2022 be higher than what will be realized in 2023? Is that how we should think about it? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I think we\u2019ll give you better guidance on 2022 as we get towards the end of the year. But it\u2019s something, as you -- it\u2019s something that will take a few years to sort of work our way through that list. And as Charlie said, we\u2019re not done. There\u2019s a long list of other items that are being bedded as we speak that sort of add to that list, so. Charlie Scharf : And let me just add to it, just so we\u2019re not trying to be coy in any way, shape or form. What we\u2019re trying to do is do what we said we would do, which is, we said last quarter that we would give you what we thought was our clearest line of sight to our expenses for 2021, which is what we\u2019ve done. As we look beyond that, we do believe there are significant additional gross cost saves to take out. But, we\u2019re also making sure that we\u2019ve got the ability as we go through the year to understand what continuing investments need to get made, which include doing everything that we need to do on the risk and regulatory front. So, we don\u2019t want to give a net number and box ourselves in and then believe we need to spend a different amount on the risk and regulatory stuff because that\u2019s going to be what it ever needs -- what it needs to be. And so, what the prepared remarks laid out was the gross saves are significant. We expect to -- what we\u2019re targeting is to continue to show net reductions year-over-year. So, we continue on this path to increasing efficiency, acknowledging that we\u2019re not giving you the specificity beyond 2021 at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. David Long : Charlie, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the bank\u2019s number one focus is building the right management team. Obviously, a lot of changes near the top and in your top operating team for the last 15 months since you\u2019ve been CEO. Are there still additional changes needed on that team? And any specific positions that you would still like to fill? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Well, so just -- first of all, our number one priority is getting the risk and regulatory work done, which will ultimately resolve these consent orders that we have. The management -- building the management team is one of the key enablers in getting there. Yes, listen, I feel great about the management team that we have. I think that this is -- these are -- it is always an ongoing process where we\u2019re always looking at once one level gets filled, everyone is looking to make sure that they\u2019ve got the right members of the team behind them. And there\u2019s no question that with all of the talent we brought in from the outside, given where we are, that enables us to leverage more of the talent inside the Company and put them in the right roles. So, I don\u2019t foresee the pace and the dramatic changes that we\u2019ve made. I think, most of that is done at this point, and then it\u2019s just continuing to build the lower levels and recognizing that there are always some changes that happen here and there for different reasons. David Long : Got it. I appreciate the color. And then, the -- you talked about additional costs still needed to improve the operations and your investments in 2021 to get out of all the remaining consent orders, where do you still think you need to spend? Do you have any areas earmarked at this point? Charlie Scharf : Yes. I mean, so, when we look at that -- what page is it? It\u2019s the page 19 that shows the -- where we break out from the $54 billion going to $53 billion, and then we break out the net $1.5 billion reduction and we show you the gross versus the investments. Embedded in that $1.6 billion is a series of things. Roughly a third of it or so are specific adds that we\u2019re doing to continue the work on building out the risk and control infrastructure. Those are everything from continued adds in compliance, independent risk and all the functions that are necessary to, for the most part, build the operational and compliance, infrastructure that\u2019s required in Fed and OCC consent orders, but is the right foundational work to do. We have a series of increases embedded in there, which are investments in technology. Some of the expenses relate to things we need to build to get the efficiencies out, but we also have some net increases there, also to continue building out some product capabilities and things like that. So, I\u2019ll just point you back to that $1.6 billion is on a gross basis, what\u2019s embedded in our numbers this year, 2021 that is. Operator : [Technical Difficulty] Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you and good morning. Charlie Scharf : Gerard, it better be a good one given the anticipation. Gerard Cassidy : There you go. I don\u2019t -- maybe you guys -- on your expense savings, you only paid for 90 minutes, and they cut you off short or something so. Anyway, thank you for taking the question. Maybe Mike, I know the net servicing income is always volatile quarter-to-quarter. Can you share with us the -- what went on with hedging this quarter? Obviously, it was a negative number. But again, I know it\u2019s volatile quarter-to-quarter. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, sure. And Gerard, I may take you up on that idea by the way of limiting the call, maybe next quarter. Look, I think, as you sort of look at the MSR asset, obviously there\u2019s a bunch of things that sort of impact what\u2019s happening, which sort of drives the servicing income in there. And I think a couple of things you saw was the higher prepays and sort of the velocity in the mortgage market impacting that. And then you also saw servicing cost as modeled. So, as you probably know, with these assets, like you\u2019re modeling your future costs, which then reduces or increases your income in the current period. And you look at the -- that servicing income going up a little bit as you sort of look at the cost that you might have to incur, given some of the forbearance programs and the extensions of those. And so, there wasn\u2019t anything outside of those items that was really driving the results. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, as a follow-up -- and I understand about the asset cap and the balance sheet, but in your net interest income expectations in slide 16, what kind of interest rate environment would you need to see for the drag that you give us in that slide for that to go away? If you had your druthers, if you could paint the interest rate environment, the sensitivity analysis, I\u2019m assuming you guys do, what would we need to see for that to disappear? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Look, as I said earlier, to get to the top end of that range, we\u2019re using sort of the implicit, the implied forward curve as it stands over the last week or so. And so, I think as you think about all else equal, any steepening from here or just overall increase from here, I think, would be helpful and additive to that. Operator : And you have time for one more question, and that question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi. Thank you for taking my question. And Charlie, thank you for your patience on this long call. I just wanted to get back to the question on gross versus net. And I wanted to get clarity on the $1.6 billion of investment spend. I think, earlier in the call, you mentioned that it was still mostly related to risk and regulatory-related work. And as we go forward and we think about the potential for a higher ratio of net versus gross, how should we think about offensive, more offensive type of expense of investment? I think, one of your peers today laid out $2.4 billion in investment spend and $900 million of which was related to tech. Charlie Scharf : Yes. So just to be clear, because I don\u2019t want to -- of the $1.6 billion that\u2019s in the investment line, again, roughly a third of that is very clearly the risk and control build-out. But, the reality is there could be other things that we\u2019re doing that\u2019s in the remainder. Another big chunk of what\u2019s in that increase are things that we\u2019re doing to drive efficiency in the Company. And then, there are obviously things that we\u2019re doing to build the future of the business. Your question of how to think about gross and net and the level of investments for the future, I think that is -- that\u2019s quite frankly -- that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re just being very careful not to commit to anything beyond 2021. For 2021, we\u2019ve been very, very thoughtful about what we believe we need to do, what we want to do and what do we actually have the capacity to do. And that\u2019s what\u2019s reflected in these numbers here. We\u2019ve hired a series of new people, both from the business side as well as Ather on the digital side. And as we think through what the expense base could be in \u201822 and beyond, we don\u2019t know at this point what we want that increase to be, which over time hopefully becomes more about building products and services that could beat more effectively in the marketplace. And so, I\u2019m not sure again how to answer the question other than we expect to be doing that. We do have some of it embedded in the numbers today. But, we want to make sure that we understand what we might want to do. At the same time that we\u2019re saying we believe based on everything we know today, that we still should be able to do best and drive the expense base down on a net basis. Just not sure what the net number is sitting here today. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : I\u2019ll be -- so a quick one firstly to start with, which is expense reduction. That\u2019s Charlie, Mike -- sorry, I jumped over and didn\u2019t go with the pleasantries of saying hello because I know you\u2019re squeezing me in. You said revenue digits down low single digits from the business exits. How about expense reduction? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Vivek, we\u2019ll give you more color as we sort of announce those and we get to the closing of some of those transactions. But, it\u2019s probably not that different I think relative to the revenue contribution. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And Charlie, since this is the only opportunity we have to talk to you, I have a question strategically just to understand because you are making a lot of changes. Three areas. Firstly, CRE. Since you are the biggest player, have been, what are you thinking there in terms of outlook for that business, including your UK commercial real estate mortgage banking since you\u2019ve cut back disclosure, is that a sign that you\u2019re pulling that back a little? And lastly, Charlie, also your outlook for trading since assets are down sharply year-on-year, or your plans for trading? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Listen, CRE, I mean, as you can see in our disclosures is an extremely important business for us. We think we have a great franchise, which is made up of -- it\u2019s the customer base, but it\u2019s also the people that we have. We\u2019re not -- our portfolio is not immune to losses that will inevitably be taken because of this environment, separate that out from we believe that we are hopefully more than appropriately reserve for that, but time will tell. The devil is in the detail when you talk about commercial real estate, in terms of -- it\u2019s a very broad caption. But, when you look at who you\u2019re lending to, what the structures are, obviously a big difference between hotels, retail, office space, the level of security you have. And so, I -- we continue to believe that done properly, it will continue to be a really important part of what we do. And we\u2019ve got a team that reacts appropriately and actions they\u2019ve taken certainly going even into COVID will serve us well. Trading, listen, I think, as I said before, Vivek, I think, you\u2019re expanding the impact a little bit. I think, there\u2019s no question that when we look at our corporate investment bank in addition to our commercial bank, when we\u2019ve asked people to take actions to reduce balance sheet, that\u2019s a place where we\u2019ve gone. And it\u2019s true on the deposit side, but it\u2019s also true on the trading side as well, both in terms of customer financing as well as trading assets where possible. Again, I would say the same thing here. I think, our customers understand what we\u2019re doing and why we\u2019re doing it. They understand the position that we\u2019re in. And I think when we\u2019ve looked at where we\u2019ve had to make reductions, it\u2019s been with an eye towards when the asset cap does eventually go away, and we have a latitude to continue building as we were building in the past. We would expect to see more resources put there, certainly to bring us back in line where we were and then to build the business like we want to build the rest of our businesses at Wells. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. One last one was mortgage banking, Charlie. Any color on that, your plans for that? Obviously, you\u2019ve been a leading player. It\u2019s a much bigger piece for you than the other G-SIFIs. What\u2019s your thinking on that? You\u2019ve cut back on correspondent. What are you thinking as you look ahead, given that you\u2019ve cut back? That was just making me wonder. Charlie Scharf : No. Listen, I think, it\u2019s -- home lending is a really important business for us to be in. I don\u2019t -- when we look at what we want to do to serve consumers across Wells Fargo, home lending -- when I say consumers, I mean, both in our consumer and small business bank as well as customers that they deal with directly through their own channels as well as our wealth segment. Home lending products are extremely important to that relationship. We\u2019ve got a great team there. As you know, Mike Weinbach runs all of home lending. Kristy Fercho joined us as the CEO of our Home Lending business. And I think, for us it\u2019s going to be going to that next level of detail, which is really understanding on the origination side by channel, what does profitability look like, how do we continue to drive more profitability, how do we compete more effectively in digital originations where the banks generally have not done a great job versus what others have done. And on the servicing side being more thoughtful probably than we\u2019ve been about portfolio by portfolio, what are the servicing economics, where do we think it makes sense for us to service, where does it not make sense for us to service. And so, I think what you\u2019ll see is, us becoming -- putting a finer point on what that looks like from a service perspective and driving more profitability on the origination side, but it\u2019s important for us. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Okay. Listen, thank you very much. Certainly, we appreciate all the time that you\u2019ve put in, not just on this call, but we know the revised disclosures create a bunch of work for you all. But hopefully, it helps us have a better conversation going forward as we talk about what the future of the Company is. And as I said, I think, we\u2019ve got a lot of work still to do. I believe we\u2019re making great progress. And when these headwinds abate and the actions that we\u2019re taking are reflected in our performance, I continue to feel really good about what the opportunity holds for us. So, thanks again for the time, and look forward to talking to you some more. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.  I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials.  Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.  I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results, the operating environment, and update you on a few important topics. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review the first quarter results in more detail. We earned $4.7 billion or $1.05 per common share in the first quarter. As you can see, these results included a $1.6 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses. Higher net interest income more than offset a decline in net interest income, and expenses are just beginning to reflect progress on our efficiency work. The impact of this work should increase in the latter half of the year.  Credit quality continued to outperform our expectations with charge-offs at historical lows, but low interest rates and tepid loan demand remained headwinds for us during the quarter. And we continue to manage within the constraints of our asset cap which require us to anticipate the inflows from government stimulus, effects of QE, and additional fiscal actions which could impact our balance sheet.  Overall economic trends improved during the quarter, and while there are risks, the likelihood of improvement continues to increase, and you certainly see this in the markets. Equity markets are rising, spread have tightened, and liquidity is strong. Additional fiscal stimulus, continued monetary support, and the acceleration of vaccine availability provide a path to a more complete reopening and further economic expansion. U.S. GDP growth is on track to surpass its pre-pandemic peak by the end of the summer and is expected to increase in 2021 by more than any year since 1984.  Overall, the consumer is strong, though there are inconsistencies which I will address later. Consumer net worth was up 10% in 2020, hitting a new all-time high of $130 trillion. Personal savings is approximately $1.3 trillion greater today than it was a year ago. It's expected that more than $1 trillion will be spent over the next 5 months, and this does not include the impact of President Biden's proposed initiatives, Wells Fargo customers specifically as of last week, over $46 billion has flowed into our customers' deposit accounts related to round 2 and round 3 of federal stimulus payments, and we estimate that half has been spent and half remains in their accounts. For our customers who received federal stimulus payments, their median deposit balance was up 80% from a year ago. And for all of our customers, including customers who did not receive stimulus payments, median balances were up 62% from a year ago. Weekly debit card spend was up every week compared to a year ago during the first quarter. The year-over-year increase accelerated in March -- in mid-March due to the impact of last year's COVID-related restrictions and the impact of stimulus payments and was up approximately 70% during this week last year of the quarter compared to a year ago but was up 35% compared to the same week in 2019.  We are seeing increased consumer spending activity in both travel and restaurants, 2 categories that have been particularly suppressed since the onset of COVID-19. Specifically for travel, for the week ended April 2, debit card spend was up 422% compared to 2020 but was still down 4% compared to 2019. Consumer credit card weekly spend continues to strengthen over the course of the first quarter as well and ended up -- and ended the quarter up approximately 70% during the last week of the quarter compared to a year ago, but importantly up 8% compared to the same week in 2019. Businesses remained strong as well. Most clients still have strong cash positions, and line utilization remained low. Demand for consumer products is high, and dealer inventory levels are meaningfully lower versus historical levels. After declining during the second half of the year, commercial loan balances seem to have stabilized. And if the economy continues to pick up, we would expect to see increased loan demand from our commercial customers in the second half of the year. With vaccine distribution accelerating, I'm hopeful that we will be shifting to a more normal way of life soon, but there's still many that will continue to need help as not all have benefited equally during the recovery. Throughout the pandemic, our focus has been providing support for our customers and the communities we serve, and we continued those efforts during the first quarter. Since the pandemic began, we've helped 3.7 million consumer and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees. In addition to our $10.5 billion of PPP funding in 2020, in the first quarter, we funded approximately 70,000 loans, totaling $2.8 billion under the latest round of the Paycheck Protection Program.  This year, we focused even more on small and diverse businesses, and our average loan size was $40,000, down from $54,000 last year. We had the lowest average loan size amongst our large bank peers. 96% have been for businesses with fewer than 20 employees. 43% have gone to businesses in either low- to moderate-income areas where majority -- minority census tracts totaling more than $6 billion between this year and last year.  We committed last year to donate approximately $420 million of our fees from the PPP program and established our Open for Business Fund. We're in the process of distributing these funds to a combination of CDFIs and not-for-profits that serve diverse small businesses. To date, we have distributed over $125 million and are working to accelerate distribution of the remaining funds. We estimate that these actions have protected more than 66,000 jobs and hope to make an even more substantial impact with the funds remaining.  As we announced yesterday, we have invested in 11 Black minority-owned deposit institutions as part of our $50 million commitment to support MDIs. We expect to complete our investments in another two by the end of the second quarter.  And as I mentioned before, we processed over $46 billion of customer deposits related to the federal stimulus payments through last week and have cashed stimulus payments for noncustomers without charging fees. While we're proud of these actions, we know there is still more to do. Lower-income families and individuals, as well as minority-owned small businesses, will continue to need support, and we will continue to look for ways to help.  Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time. And last month, Wells Fargo announced a major step in our efforts to support the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions, including financed emissions, by 2050. We committed to publish data on our financed emissions and set interim goals as we work closely with our clients in this transition. We also released our first Task Force for Climate-related Disclosure -- I'm sorry, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures report in the first quarter, which provides an update on our progress managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Let me turn to make some comments about our strategic priorities. Last quarter in my shareholder letter, I discussed the -- and in the shareholder letter, I discussed the actions we're taking to improve our performance, and we're making good progress. We continue to prioritize the work necessary to build the appropriate risk and control infrastructure, and it remains our top priority. As a reminder, this is a multiyear journey. Progress may not be a straight line. And while we still have significant work to do, we are diligently doing what's necessary, issue by issue. It's hard to share specifics given the nature of the work, but I believe we're making progress, and we're confident in our ability to complete the work.  In terms of business exits, I highlighted on the call last quarter that we were focusing our efforts on our core scale businesses. And after rigorous reviews, we were in the process of exploring options for businesses that were not consistent with our strategic priorities. Mike will cover the financial details. But in the first quarter, we announced agreements to sell Wells Fargo Asset Management and the Corporate Trust Services businesses, and both are expected to close in the second half of this year. In addition, we completed a portion of the sale of the student loan portfolio, and we completed the sale of the majority of the remaining portfolio recently. We're pleased that we have found buyers who we believe have a similar approach to service and are focused on providing clients with innovative products and solutions. These announcements are an important step to simplifying our business and allowing us to focus on our core strategic priorities. Our work to simplify how we operate and create a more efficient organization continues. We made progress on our brand staffing and network optimization plans as we calibrate for changing customer behaviors and more traffic migrates to digital channels. We continued to execute on our commercial banking transformation as we optimize our coverage and operations model, consolidate lending platforms and automate and standardize many manual processes, such as onboarding, a customer pain point which has been key for us. And across the entire enterprise, we continue our ongoing efforts to reduce management layers to speed decision-making and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy. We are also focused on moving our businesses forward. A few examples. On the consumer banking side, we're accelerating our investments in digital with a particular focus on delivering a simple, easy-to-use, best-in-class customer experience for the most-used mobile app features. We're also simplifying enhancing our product line, including launching Clear Access Banking, our low-cost, no overdraft product, and we've opened over 500,000 new accounts since the launch last fall. And this summer, we will be improving the benefits of our portfolio by Wells Fargo checking customers. As I've spoken about before, we're underpenetrated in credit card given our customer footprint, and we're working on developing a significantly improved value proposition that we can introduce to the market. And on the commercial side, we're going after the middle market investment banking opportunity in a different way than we have previously. This includes joint accountability, investments in talent, name-by-name client prioritization and joint account planning. Mike will discuss capital more in his remarks, but our position remains extremely strong. We repurchased almost $600 million of common stock in the quarter. And based on the restrictions still in place for the second quarter, we have the capacity to return approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders. As a reminder, our asset cap limits our ability to deploy excess capital to our customers. Returning capital to shareholders remains a priority, and we look forward to resuming capital returns under the stress capital buffer methodology starting in the third quarter.  Last quarter, I discussed constraints to achieving return on tangible common equity greater than 10% and then around 15%. I should note that those returns did not include credit loss reserve releases. The asset cap and capital return restrictions continue, but the progress on vaccination distribution, ongoing monetary policy, additional fiscal stimulus and higher interest rates are helpful. We're in the midst of a multiyear transformation, and I'm confident that our operational and financial performance will continue to benefit from the progress we're making. I'd like to end by acknowledging that we've asked so much of our entire Wells Fargo team, and I'm proud of all the work they've done to support our customers and the communities we serve. We will continue to do all we can to support an equitable recovery and help those most in need of our support.  I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Charlie highlighted many of the ways we're actively helping our customers and communities, which we highlighted on Slide 2, so I'm going to start with our first quarter financial results on Slide 3. Net income for the quarter was $4.7 billion or $1.05 per common share. Revenue grew from both a year ago and the fourth quarter as the decline in net interest income was more than offset by higher noninterest income. Our first quarter results included a $1.6 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses. And as a reminder, in the first half of last year, we built reserves by a total of $11.5 billion, and we had $18 billion of allowance for credit losses at the end of the first quarter. We completed the sale of approximately half of our student loan portfolio in the first quarter, which resulted in a $208 million gain and $104 million goodwill write-down, and we closed the majority of the remaining portfolio just this past weekend. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 6.4%, which included net discrete income tax benefits related to closing out prior year's tax matters. Our capital and liquidity remained strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.8% under the Standardized Approach and 12.6% under the Advanced Approach. We repurchased 17.2 million shares of common stock for a total of $596 million, and we had $33 billion of excess capital over our CET1 regulatory minimum at quarter end. Our liquidity coverage ratio was 127%.  Turning to Slide 5, which summarizes the financial impact of the business sales Charlie highlighted. We have included the 2020 revenue and expense associated with the businesses in the slide. While they represented a little over 3% of 2020 revenue, the pretax earnings is much smaller. Note that the table does not include the credit cost associated with the student loan portfolio, which can have a meaningful impact on the business's P&L, and the expected expense reductions related to this business are incorporated into our $53 billion outlook for the year. Also, the expenses we have included related to the Corporate Trust and Asset Management businesses are the total expenses for those businesses. Some of those expenses may continue after we close the deals as we have transition service agreements, and roughly 10% to 20% of those expenses are items, such as corporate overhead, that will take time to manage out of the expense run rate. In terms of segment reporting, the Asset Management business is now reported in Corporate. Given that we announced the sale of the Corporate Trust business late in the quarter, that business is still included in Commercial Banking and will move to the Corporate sector in the second quarter.  Turning to credit quality on Slide 6. Our net charge-off ratio in the first quarter declined to 24 basis points, the lowest it's been in a number of years and down 14 basis points from a year ago. Our losses have trended significantly better than our expectations due to the impact of forbearance programs and the unprecedented amounts of government stimulus. While there's still a lot of uncertainty, there are encouraging and improving trends related to commercial credit quality. Commercial net loan charge-offs declined $159 million from the fourth quarter to 13 basis points, the lowest loss rate since the third quarter of 2019. The improvement was broad-based with declines in all asset types, including $116 million of lower commercial real estate losses. As we have done since the start of the pandemic, we continue to closely monitor our exposure to retail, hotel and office property types. The reopening of the economy has had a positive impact on retail and hotel as cash flow levels have begun to improve. That said, stress remains, and retail, in particular, was the driver of charge-offs in the first quarter. Though, clearly, there are negative demand trends in many office markets, the office portfolio continued to perform well, and we're not seeing any widespread stress in the portfolio as of now. Consumer net charge-offs declined $221 million from a year ago with improvements across all asset types but increased $88 million from the fourth quarter with higher losses in other consumer loans and credit card but still continue to be low. Nonperforming assets declined $692 million or 8% from the fourth quarter driven by lower commercial nonaccruals, primarily due to declines in energy and commercial real estate nonaccruals. $10.7 billion of our consumer loan portfolio, excluding government-insured loans, remaining COVID-related payment deferrals at the end of the first quarter. We stopped offering non-real estate-related COVID deferrals in the fourth quarter, and 98% of the balances that were still in deferral at quarter end were real estate-related. Loans that have already exited COVID deferrals have continued to perform better than we anticipated with over 95% of the balances current as of the end of the first quarter. Though we're not -- Though we're still not all the way back to pre-pandemic levels, we've continued to adjust our credit policies to reflect better economic conditions. Due to the reserve release in the first quarter, our allowance coverage ratio declined from the fourth quarter but was up 90 basis points from a year ago. Similar to the fourth quarter, while observed performance has been strong, there was still a significant amount of uncertainty reflected in our allowance level at the end of the first quarter, and we'll continue to assess the level of our allowance. If the economic trends continue, we would expect to have additional reserve releases. On Slide 8, we highlight loans and deposits. Our average loans declined for the third consecutive quarter and were down 9% from a year ago. The decline from the fourth quarter was driven by lower residential real estate loans due to continued high prepayments and re-securitization of loans we purchased out of mortgage-backed securities last year. Real estate loan balances have been impacted by actions we took early last year to discontinue correspondent nonconforming originations in home equity lending. We have started to originate correspondent nonconforming loans again and should start to see more volume from this channel over time. Commercial loans were relatively stable from the fourth quarter but were down 8% from a year ago when there was a strong borrower draw activity during the early stages of the pandemic.  Average deposits grew $55.5 billion or 4% from a year ago and 1% from the fourth quarter with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking, partially offset by declines in the Corporate, Investment Banking business, Corporate Treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. With continued deposit growth, we have been actively managing down our long-term debt outstanding. We tendered for $6.8 billion of senior and subordinated debt in the first quarter. And along with maturities, total long-term debt declined $29.6 billion or 14% from the fourth quarter and was down 23% from a year ago.  Turning to net interest income on Slide 9. Net interest income declined 5% from the fourth quarter driven by 2 fewer days, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, continued repricing of the balance sheet and lower loan balances. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit of lower long-term debt. On the call last quarter, we provided our 2021 net interest income outlook. We still expect net interest income to be flat to down 4% from the annualized fourth quarter level of $36.8 billion as the benefit of a steeper yield curve has been largely offset by softer-than-anticipated loan demand, low utilization rates on commercial loans and faster-than-expected prepayments on residential mortgages. That said, it's important to recognize we are still early in the year, and our ultimate results for the year will remain dependent on how rate and lending environments evolve. If rates follow the current forward curve and commercial loans grow as the economic recovery gains momentum, which is expected by the industry, we would expect NII to land near the high end of the range. However, if loan demand proves softer than expectations, our total loan balance or -- and our total loan balance remains flat compared with where we ended the first quarter, we would expect to finish closer to the middle of the range. We continue to closely monitor the evolving trends across each of the major drivers, and we'll provide updates to our outlook as the year progresses.  Turning to expenses on Slide 10. Noninterest expense increased 7% from a year ago driven by increased personnel expense. Deferred comp expense reduced personnel expenses in the first quarter of last year by $598 million. As a reminder, late in the second quarter of last year, we changed how we hedge deferred compensation, which reduced the volatility in our reporting for this item starting in the third quarter of last year. Personnel expense also increased from a year ago from higher incentive and revenue-related compensation, including the impact of higher market valuations on stock-based compensation, which was partially offset by lower salaries. All other expense was down 4% from a year ago driven by lower professional services expense due to efficiency initiatives. Our expenses declined 5% from the fourth quarter as seasonally higher personnel expense was more than offset by lower restructuring charges and operating losses.  Our 2021 expense outlook is unchanged at approximately $53 billion with lower annualized expenses toward the end of the year. As we said on our last earnings call, our outlook excludes restructuring charges and the cost of business exits, such as the $104 million goodwill write-down related to the sale of student loans.  We assumed $1 billion of operating losses in the outlook. The first quarter included $213 million of operating losses. But as you know, these expenses can be lumpy, especially as we continue to resolve legacy issues. We also assumed approximately $500 million of incremental revenue-related expenses as these have been higher than expected so far this year due to strong equity markets, which is a good thing, as revenue more than offsets any increase. If the current market level holds, we would expect incremental revenue-related compensations this year to be approximately $800 million, but we are still early in the year, and we'll update you as the year progresses. We are continuing to execute on efficiency initiatives, and additional initiatives continue to be identified and vetted.  Turning to our business segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Net income increased from a year ago driven by revenue growth in home lending and lower provision for credit losses. Consumer and small business banking revenue declined 6% from a year ago, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and lower deposit-related fees. The decline in deposit-related fees was driven by higher average checking account balances and higher COVID-related fee waivers. We expect a high level of Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness in the second quarter, which would result in higher net interest income. But as a reminder, the fees on those loans originated last year are being donated, so you will see a corresponding increase in donation expense, so it won't impact the bottom line.  Home lending revenue increased 19% from a year ago on higher retail originations and gain-on-sale margins. The 12% increase from the fourth quarter was primarily due to higher mortgage banking income related to the re-securitization of loans we purchased from mortgage-backed securities last year and an increase in retail originations. Credit card revenue declined 2% from both the fourth quarter and a year ago due to lower loan balances, reflecting elevated payment rates. We continue to make progress in executing our efficiency initiatives in our branches. Transaction volume continues to shift away from our branches with 82% of consumer and small business deposits in the first quarter done digitally, up from 76% a year ago. We have closed 395 branches since the first quarter of 2020, including 90 branches in the first quarter of 2021. We are on track to complete the remainder of the 250 branches we expect to consolidate this year. We've also continued to adjust staffing levels, including the reductions related to branch closures. Importantly, to date, we've been able to make these adjustments while reducing customer attrition and improving client satisfaction. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 12. Our first quarter retail mortgage origination volume was the highest since 2016. Total mortgage originations increased 8% from a year ago as a $6.7 billion decline in correspondent originations was more than offset by $10.5 billion of higher retail originations. Total mortgage originations declined 4% from the fourth quarter due to the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market and as a growth -- and as growth in retail originations was more than offset by a decline in correspondent originations. While the mortgage origination market is expected to decline in the second quarter as the anticipated increase in the seasonal purchase market is expected to be more than offset by decline in refinancings, we currently expect our origination volume to be robust as we have strong demand in the retail channel, and we continue to build up volume in the correspondent nonconforming market. Auto originations increased 32% from the fourth quarter and 8% from a year ago in a strong market with supply shortages for both new and used cars. With improving -- with the improving economic forecast, we are gradually returning to pre-pandemic underwriting policies. Turning to debit card. Purchase volume increased 3% from seasonally strong fourth quarter levels. Debit card volume increased 20% from a year ago, reflecting higher consumer spending due to stimulus payments and improving economic conditions. And credit card purchase volume declined from seasonally high fourth quarter levels. Purchase volume was up 6% from a year ago as lower year-over-year volume early in the quarter due to continued reductions in travel and entertainment spend was more than offset by growth in March. Commercial Banking net income was up from both the fourth quarter and a year ago due to a decline in the provision for credit losses. Middle Market Banking revenue declined 20% from a year ago driven by the impact of lower interest rates as well as lower loan balances from reduced client demand and line utilization.  Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue grew 7% from a year ago driven by higher net gains on equity securities in our strategic capital business as first quarter 2020 included impairments due to a decline in market valuations. This was partially offset by lower net interest income in first quarter 2021 from lower loan balances.  Noninterest expense increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher technology spend, partially offset by lower headcount and consulting expense related to efficiency initiatives. Average loans declined for the third consecutive quarter and went down 19% from a year ago as COVID-related draws were repaid, and loan demand and credit line utilization remained weak. Average deposits were up 8% from a year ago as stimulus programs have injected significant liquidity into the market.  Turning to the Corporate and Investment Banking business on Slide 14. In Banking, revenue declined 6% from a year ago driven by the impact of lower interest rates and lower deposit balances and grew 7% from the fourth quarter. The linked-quarter growth was driven by a 20% increase in Investment Banking revenue with strong debt and equity originations, partially offset by decline in advisory fees from strong fourth quarter levels.  Commercial real estate revenue grew 5% from a year ago, primarily due to improved CMBS gain-on-sale margins driven by spread tightening as well as an increase in low-income housing tax credit income. Market revenue increased 19% from a year ago on strong client demand for asset-backed finance products, other credit products and municipal bonds, which was partially offset by lower demand for rates, products and lower equities and commodities revenue. Average deposits declined 27% and average trading-related assets were down 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by continued actions we've taken to manage under the asset cap. As I mentioned earlier, Wealth and Investment Management results exclude Wells Fargo Asset Management, which is now reported in Corporate and prior periods have been revised. Net income declined 18% in the business from the fourth quarter. Revenue grew, reflecting higher asset-based fees and higher retail brokerage transactional activity. Expenses were up due to seasonally higher personnel expense. Net income declined 8% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower interest rates on net interest income, partially offset by the higher asset-based fees.  We ended the first quarter with record client assets of $2 trillion, up 28% from a year ago, reflecting strong market performance. Net flows into advisory accounts improved in the first quarter from a year ago in the fourth quarter. Average deposits were up 19% from a year ago, and average loans increased 4% from a year ago, largely due to customer demand for securities-based lending offerings. Slide 16 highlights our Corporate results, which included $1.2 billion of lower net interest income from a year ago, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, offset by a $1.4 billion increase in noninterest income. First quarter 2020 included equity impairments in our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships, and results in the first quarter of 2021 included a $208 million gain on the sale of the student loans portfolio. Noninterest expense declined from the fourth quarter on lower restructuring charges.  And we'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : I guess first one I wanted to ask about is on NII guidance. So specifically in terms of premium amortization, there's about a $250 million delta between today's level of premium am and where it was a year ago. Does that -- last year's level of about $360 million or so, does that represent, in your mind, a pretty typical level? And then kind of how quickly does it move back down to there? Michael Santomassimo : Scott, it's Mike. I think you really got to remember what happened last year that would have impacted premium amort, right? It was a bit of an abnormal quarter as you sort of got to the end of the quarter. I think from here, I think, based on what we're seeing, premium amort probably has peaked in the first quarter and starts to trend down from here. How long it takes to sort of get to a kind of normalized view, I think we'll see over the next -- we'll have a better clarity on that, I think, over the next couple of quarters. But we would expect it to start trending down from here. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. And then just a separate question. So the lending recovery is kind of a big question for you guys and others. I guess, just regardless of what happens with industry trends, maybe if you could speak to where you feel you guys are getting your fair share of loan growth and where you think you might still need to do better. I know you had mentioned, for example, credit card as being very underpenetrated, but just curious to hear broader thoughts there as well. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Look, as what you'll probably hear from a lot of folks, the demand across really most commercial client segments has been pretty weak now and probably has stabilized or seems to have stabilized over the last couple of months, but But I think we'll sort of see how that progresses into later this quarter. I think as we sort of look at where the opportunity is, as the economy and the momentum in the economy really starts to take off more, it's really across the board in our core client segments. In our Middle Market, our Commercial Banking, more broadly, I think there'll be opportunity in kind of the core large Corporate segment, maybe to a lesser degree, but we do really expect to see that Commercial Banking demand start to pick up as the economy picks up. And so, I would sort of highlight that.  I think Charlie has talked a lot about the credit card space. I think there'll be growth there, but given sort of the relative size of our portfolio to the balance sheet, I think that the impact there will be modest to the overall size of sort of our loan portfolio. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just wondering, Mike, if you can kind of just recodify that expense commentary for the year. You said the $53 billion number, and then you also talked about the revenue-related lift of about $800 million. So, is that just the reset to $53.8 [ph] billion, all things equal? I just want to make sure we know what that includes and doesn't include and how you expect it to traject from here. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Sure, Ken. Thanks for the question. So, if you recall how we sort of set the $53 billion target, I'll just give you a little bit of a background there so -- that we covered last quarter. So, embedded in that $53 billion target was an increase of about $0.5 billion of revenue-related expenses and about $1 billion of operating losses sort of embedded in there. And what we excluded from there is the cost to exit the businesses, which you saw a little bit this quarter, the $100 million or so this quarter for the student loans business and any restructuring charges that come throughout the year. So, as you sort of think about the go-forward piece of it, the $53 billion, we still feel really good about. I think what's putting a little bit of pressure on that is the incremental $300 million of revenue-related expense. So, I don't think it's a foregone conclusion. That -- it's -- we're going to be $300 million higher, but I do think that's putting pressure on the $53 billion. So, it's possible we're a little over that if the revenue-related expenses hold, which by the way should be a good thing, right, because that means there's plenty of revenue on the other side of that to offset it. Ken Usdin : And that was going to be my follow-up, Mike, which is was the revenue uplift, what you had already seen in the first quarter or is it things that you feel better about going forward that we haven't necessarily seen yet but you're now anticipating a better revenue environment? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. We did see a little bit of it in the first quarter as equity markets outperformed, I think, everyone's expectations. So, if those market levels hold throughout the rest of the year, that's when you'll see the rest of that revenue-related comp come in. And so, you'll see the revenue associated with it throughout the rest of the year. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then I'm sorry, just last one on it. Are you still expecting the end-of-year on expenses to be lower than the beginning, as you had said, also in the fourth quarter, that trajectory still holds directionally? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Directionally, that's right. We'll get more benefit from the efficiency initiatives that we're executing later in the year, so that will sort of impact the run rate, and I would just point out and remind people that we do have a lot of seasonal expenses that hit the first quarter. And so you sort of need to normalize for those as you go out for the rest of the year as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : My first question is a clarification question for Mike. Clearly, the market responded to this comment. I think you noted that if loan growth was going to be -- continue to be tough this year, that you would be -- NII would be down 2% from annualized fourth quarter, which I think the market is taking that you're bringing in your NII guide for the year. And I just wanted to make sure we interpreted that correctly, that it seems like a more realistic outlook for NII now with the curve steepening and perhaps green shoots on loan growth is flat to down 2%. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. No. Thanks, Erika, for the question. Our guidance still holds that down -- it's somewhere between flat to the fourth quarter run rate to down 4%. And consistent to what we said in the first quarter, to get to the top of the range, we need to see some loan growth. That's still the case, although rates have offset some weakness that we've seen so far. And I think to get to kind of the middle of the range, we really need rates to kind of hold where they are, and we won't need a lot of loan growth from here to hit that. But I think there's plenty of scenarios that you can sort of think through that put you somewhere else in the range. But what we tried to give you were a couple kind of realistic data points relative to where we think it -- what's possible in terms of where we'll land within the range. Erika Najarian : Got it. Very helpful. And my second question is for Charlie. Charlie, clearly, the market is reacting to what seems to be a brighter revenue picture for Wells and continued progress in your transition and turnaround, and it feels like it's shrugging off. Typically, your stock wouldn't be up 3% after saying that expenses could slip higher. And clearly, the market doesn't care given the revenue outlook. I guess I'm wondering as we look forward to 2021 and hearing you loud and clear on some of the investments that you're already planning to make in the consumer side, what are the puts and takes in terms of a greater bottom line or benefit from the second half of that $8 billion cost savings that you've identified versus an economic picture that is clearly brightened, even over the past 3 months? In other words, should we think of your expenses having a higher floor, let's say, $50 billion to $51 billion, as we look out to 2022? And obviously, that would come with greater efficiencies as revenue continue to improve. Charles Scharf : Thanks, Erika. Listen, I don't think there's anything more that we're going to say in terms of what we would expect expenses to be going forward beyond what Mike covered in his remarks and what we said on last quarter. When we look at the opportunities to continue to drive efficiency in the company, which is really all about just running a better company, those continue to be extremely significant. We laid out, just on a gross basis, what we thought those opportunities were and our degree of confidence in being able to achieve that given the level of specificity that we had in the line of sight. And I think that still holds true. And over time, we would expect to continue to find more, kind of peeling the onion back. And at the same time, we are investing in the business. And it's on the consumer side. It's on data. It's across the Home Lending platform, the card platform, our products in the consumer bank, what we're doing in our Middle Market Business with technology account, I mean, I can go on and on of all the things that we're doing.  So I think that's all embedded in our statement that we would expect the fourth quarter, in order to get to $53 billion, just would clearly be a lower run rate than the $53 billion itself. And that as we look forward, we hope to see net expense reductions as we continue to drive efficiency while continuing to add investments into the business. So hopefully, that's responsive to what you're asking. Erika Najarian : Strong message this quarter. Appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I had a question around how you're thinking about the dividend and the buybacks. We know that post-CCAR stress test, assuming you pass that, that there's a little bit more room for you to do both of those things. So maybe you could give us a sense as to how you would approach the buyback and the dividend decision post stress test. And in particular, what kind of time frame are you thinking about that you would need to optimize the capital structure down to your management targets because you're sitting with a lot of excess capital today, as you know? Charles Scharf : Sure. Mike, why don't I start and then you can pick up? I guess we'd start with the dividend. It's not lost on us that our dividend is quite low, certainly relative to where we're earning today and as we look forward. And we all know that that's a consequence of 2 things. It's a consequence of the restrictions that were put in place by the fed in terms of what those limitations were, but it was also a point of view that we had, which was we didn't want to have to, if the environment even would get worse from that point in time, be in a position to have to reduce the dividend again. So we would like to increase the dividend to a more reasonable level. We think about it as targeting a payout ratio, excluding reserve releases and things like that. And then beyond that, it is investment in the business. It's deploying our capital for our clients and the difference being buybacks ultimately, just given the amount of excess capital that we have today. And, Mike, you can talk a little bit about the timing. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. And as you sort of think about timing, obviously, we've got a lot of components to sort of think about there. But you sort of think about it over the next year or so or year, I think that sort of gets you probably a reasonable time frame to sort of work our way down, assuming, as we've been told, that the restrictions come off and we're back to sort of a more normal stress capital buffer regime. And so I would sort of think about it over that time frame, Betsy, in terms of what the timing looks like. And obviously, some of that's dependent upon CCAR and the results and how that all plays out. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And on the payout ratios, I mean, the dividend had been on the higher end of the peer group, but your peer group is running somewhere between 30% and 40%. And that's -- I would think what you mean by reasonable -- I'm not asking you to tell me what ratio, but I guess I'm asking you is that the right peer group? Or would you say you should widen your aperture a little bit and go more like 25% to 40%, bring in some of the G-SIBs in there? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. No. Look, I think as you sort of think about the payout ratio over time, I think we'll sort of come up. And obviously, it's going to be a Board decision, Betsy, in terms of what the dividend trajectory sort of looks like. But it's not lost on us that we need to sort of be in a reasonable sort of payout range over time. And obviously, that's going to be dependent upon what we think the earnings capacity is going to look like. And so I think you'll see that sort of come through over time and as we sort of have more ability to distribute capital. Charles Scharf : Yes. And I guess I would just add, Betsy, just real quick is, I think the way -- I mean, I think the numbers and whatnot, the way you talked about it is generally the right way to think about it in terms of how -- I mean, number one, we were clearly high relative to what others were and in terms of what we -- probably makes sense for us. That's not the way we're thinking about it. More long-term range in terms, I think what you talked about is right. We would like to do something sooner rather than later. And that might not get us to where we ultimately want to be, but it would be, I think, an important step that that's the direction that we're going. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Just on the margin front. I just wanted to see if you could quantify the impact of the hedge ineffectiveness on the net interest margin this quarter. And then separately, could you just talk about margin expectations from here, just given the rate backdrop as you look -- we're looking at the bottom here, and we could see some upside as we move through the rest of the year? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Sure. John, it's Mike. The hedging effect in this had about a 3 basis point impact on net interest margin. And as you probably know, we'll get that back, a negative 3 basis point impact, and we'll get that back over time. These are -- hedge ineffectiveness is sort of a temporary difference that comes back. As you sort of look -- think about the outlook from here, if the case that we sort of laid out that gets us to the top of our NII range plays out in the way that underpins that, then we should see some growth in both NII and NIM from here. And so this, hopefully, will be either bottom or pretty close to the bottom as you sort of look forward, if that case plays out. Now as you know, NIM can move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter, so you might have that bounce around, but the general trajectory should be positive. John Pancari : Okay. Got it, Mike. And then last -- separately, on the cost save side, I know you expect about $1.5 billion to follow the bottom line of the $3.7 billion this year. Can you maybe help us think about the magnitude that can fall to the bottom line of the remaining savings, of the remaining $4.3 billion as they're received? Any additional color you can provide this quarter now that you're beginning to peel the onion, as you noted earlier? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, John, I would just go back to what we just talked about a few minutes ago. As you sort of think about the trajectory of the expenses, we'll get more of that impact as we go throughout the year. And as Charlie just mentioned, the run rate as we go into the fourth quarter will be a lower -- at a lower rate. And as we sort of think about the investments we need to make and also the additional efficiency initiatives that we vet and sort of are working on top of what we talked about last quarter play out, we'll provide more guidance on that as we think about 2022 when we get later in the year. Charles Scharf : And this is Charlie. I just want to add a couple of things, if I can. First of all, I'd just remind everyone that we have a tremendous amount of work to do on our control environment and when you look at the consent orders and all those things. And so no one has asked about that. And again, there's really very little that we can say, as I said in my prepared remarks, but we have a lot of work to do. We're going to -- we're committed to spend whatever is necessary, and it is a significant amount of money. And as we get into next year, we're not going to lock ourselves into a certain number because we have to spend what's appropriate. And so as we get closer, we'll be in a better position to give you more color. But it's -- given it's 3 quarters away, it just doesn't make any sense.  And I also just want to -- just remark, we are very focused on improving efficiency of the company, but the world is moving really quickly. We have a lot of work to do in terms of building the businesses and putting ourselves in a position so that we do create the kind of revenue growth that we would expect to be able to get out of this franchise. And so that's just a reminder. Part of the reason why we're not being too specific about what we expect beyond this year because as we continue to do our work and plan for the future, we have the ability to do what's necessary to build the company for the long term, while we've still said, we still would expect expenses to be down on a net basis as we look into the out-years. But more to come as time goes on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James. David Long : Charlie, we've talked a lot about the businesses and becoming more efficient, if you will, and focusing on those that impact your strategic priorities. Are there any businesses that you would like to increase your critical mass in or new businesses to get into that you think would be helpful to your strategic priorities? Charles Scharf : I think -- so when you -- on the first point, I think the -- when we look at these -- our four businesses that we report publicly, we generally believe that there are material growth prospects in all of them, all through very, very different reasons. And so it's hard to sit here today and say whether one should be a little bit higher than the others, but I think we feel great about the positions we have. We feel great about the opportunities in each, and so I think that should be a -- that's an honest assessment of the way we view our businesses. What was the second part of the question again? I'm sorry. David Long : Just are there any holes or any opportunities that you see to increase critical mass and any specifics in any of those business lines? Just thinking about any areas where if we had some excess capital, could you invest it there to gain some market share, enhance your goal to improve your strategic priority outlook? Charles Scharf : Yes. I think all the things that we have to do at this point are continuing to build out the products and services that we have at the core of the franchise. I mean we're spending a significant amount of money and think we've got a significant opportunity given the size of our consumer footprint and in terms of what we should be doing from a digital perspective. The way we kind of look at it internally is we're in the game, but we're not at all a market leader in terms of what our digital capabilities are. We have a very, very clear road map about what we intend to build out, and we would start to be bringing those things to market this year. But as I said, when we talk about what we're spending this year in that $53 billion, that is included in there. And we've got opportunities like that across all the businesses, so I think we're not in a position to buy anything at this point. Our focus is on spending our money to strengthen what we have but still believe that there are material opportunities to do that, some shorter term and some longer term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Just a long-term strategic question, trying to look past the asset cap and everything. As we think about the Investment Bank, what is the vision for that longer term? You've got a competitive advantage in the SLR, which is becoming more and more evident with the fed exemption going away. I think you're about 100, 150 basis points above peers. Is there a way to better leverage that? And then maybe you could just also comment on the equity trading. And it's not huge numbers but was that impacted by a hedge fund out there? Charles Scharf : So let me start. I think our aspirations in the -- for our Corporate and Investment Bank, it's actually interesting because, actually, other than the fact that we're not afraid to talk about it, I actually don't think about it being really all that different from what we've been doing over the past bunch of years. When you look at our results, the Corporate and Investment Bank is an extremely important part of the company. That's not because I declared anything differently. All we did is we broke out the results, so you actually saw the importance of it.  A significant part of it is the Corporate Bank, but the Investment Bank is a meaningful portion of it as well. And so as we think about what it should look like going forward, we want to continue to build out the Corporate and Investment Bank, as we've been doing in a very linear way, not in an exponential way, not moving beyond our risk appetite that kind of defines what Wells Fargo is, but just by serving the existing customers that we have in most parts of the company in a much more holistic way. And ultimately, over a period of time, that does allow you to expand your reach in terms of what your client base is. And so we're focused on the products and services that our predominantly U.S. customers want from us. We've talked about the opportunities to penetrate the Corporate and Investment Banking products into the middle market. But it's true of there's significant opportunities in the large corporate market in the U.S., where we've got significant treasury management relationships, material lending relationships, and we're completely underpenetrated in terms of what fees are for those customers relative to -- at other institutions. So that's the way we're thinking about it. And again, I would just stress, it's a continuation of building it out in a methodical way, not focusing on using risk in order to grow share, but focusing on our customer relationships that we have because we have a shot.  And just to be clear, on the equity piece that you're talking about, just remember, we do have an equity platform, which you can see in our results. I would just describe in terms of our prime brokerage business because I'm sure we'll get a question on it, so I'll just answer it now. Our exposure in total and our individual exposures, I would describe as just very consistent with the size of our platform. We manage it the way we -- in terms of risk, the way we manage all the risks in the Corporate and Investment Bank. And I think you've seen the results over a period of time there in terms of what that means because it's not just what you do, it's how you do it. And so we did have a relationship with Archegos. We said publicly that we were always well collateralized. We exited it with all of our exposure with no loss, and I'll just add that we had substantial excess collateral after liquidation.  So it just says, again, in terms of the way we think about how we want to manage businesses that have risk in it, not that we'll be perfect all the time, and as is the case in all events, the lessons to be learned, both in terms of what we've done and what others have done, and we'll factor that into how we manage the business as we always would. Michael Santomassimo : And I would just add just one thing as you sort of think about our growth from here. We are a bit constrained in growing our Investment Bank with the asset cap restrictions that we have in place given the significant growth that we've seen in consumer deposits, in particular. So as you sort of think about that time line and that approach Charlie said, that will take some time to sort of play out. Charles Scharf : Yes. Just to reiterate that as we look at the actions that we've had to take to accommodate all the liquidity that we've seen, the Corporate and Investment Bank has beared the biggest brunt in terms of where we've actually gone to create a bunch of that capacity. So as we think about the future, the first step is actually just getting back to where we were. Matt O'Connor: And then just to clarify, the decline in equity trading year-over-year, is that just -- if it wasn't from Archegos, is that distortion from the retirement? There's some noise, I think, related to that in the year ago comp. Was that what's driving that? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. It's just activity levels in our business. And our business is a little bit different than others, a little bit smaller cash business that sort of, I think, drove a lot of activity this quarter. So I think there's a number of factors sort of driving it. No individual sort of item that's significant. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So wanted to start off with a question for Mike, just on the fee income outlook. Lots of moving pieces in the quarter. But how should we be thinking about the appropriate jumping-off point for core fee income as we think about the completion of the business sales and maybe some normalization in IB and mortgage activity? I know that there's more explicit guidance that's been given on the NII side. I was hoping you can maybe unpack how we should be thinking about that core fee income run rate from here, pro forma the completion of those sales. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. So obviously, we've given you a lot of detail on those sales, so you can model in the impact that that's going to have on fee income pretty easily. As you sort of think about some of the other big line items underneath that, we had about $2.8 billion in the quarter for advisory and other asset-based fees, primarily in our wealth business. And as you sort of think about the key driver there, it's going to be equity market levels. And so you can model what you think is going to happen there, plus flows that may come in.  As you said, another $1.3 billion in the mortgage business. That is a bit cyclical, as you sort of pointed out. But given what we're -- what we see at this point for the second quarter, we expect to have robust origination volumes in our business. And so that should be a good quarter, at least. And as rates continue to rise, you'll see some impact there in terms of volume impact there.  As you look at some of the other pieces, you got deposit and lending fees about -- just under a couple of billion dollars there, too. I think those are pressured in the short run but should see some normalization in growth over time. You've got card fees which should grow with economic activity. And then you've got another couple of billion that's kind of -- I'd kind of characterize as more transactional in nature, whether it's commissions or investment banking fees. And so I think if you sort of think about it that way, you can probably come up with a few drivers that sort of help you model that in a way that gives you some -- gives you a view on where it's headed. Steven Chubak : And just for my follow-up on NII, maybe focusing on liquidity deployment. You guys are in a very strong excess liquidity position. I know that a couple of quarters ago, and I think, Mike, it was actually your predecessor who alluded to the fact that your appetite was tepid to redeploy some of that excess into securities, just given, at that point in time, the curve was flat as a pancake. Now that we've seen some incremental steepening, was hoping you could speak to what's contemplated in the NII guidance in terms of excess liquidity deployment and your appetite to actually grow the securities book from here, just given your liquidity capacity to do so. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. No. As you point out, we've got plenty of capacity. And I think as you look at what happened in the quarter, kind of in a marginal way, a little under $10 billion we've increased the portfolio. So we've started to redeploy a bit of it. But as you sort of point out, although the curve has steepened, rates are still relatively low. And so we're working to balance sort of the short-term carry we're going to get by redeploying faster with OCI impacts over time and how to do this in the most effective way. And when we get good entry points, we're taking advantage of it. So I would think that we're going to continue to redeploy at a prudent pace as we see opportunities that sort of make sense from, not just the short-term carry view, but also all the other items that we sort of need to take into account as we sort of look forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Mike, I believe you mentioned that the expenses -- or some of the expenses associated with the Asset Management business and the Corporate Trust business will be sticky and will remain for a bit. And we're talking about, annual, in 2020, about $1.7 billion in aggregate. What's still a little bit unclear to me is in the $53 billion expense number, what proportion of that $53 billion or $1.7 billion is embedded in the $53 billion guide?  And I guess, as an adjunct to that, I guess, can you just talk about how sticky those expenses, how -- what proportion of those expenses will stick around? How do they roll off of what time period? Because I guess what I'm a little bit sensitive to is with the sale of the 3 businesses, you're creating about a $2.3 billion revenue hole and just want to make sure that they're -- that we understand that there is no notable impact on the expense base. So if you can just help us unpack some of this stuff, it would be helpful. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. No. It's a good question. So as you sort of think about Corporate Trust and Asset Management, we assume that those expenses would be here for the full year in the $53 billion. So there's no savings assumed relative to the outlook we gave you. So that's sort of, I guess, point number one.  On the other parts of the question, what we were trying to point out is with both of these businesses, probably -- certainly for the Corporate Trust business to maybe a greater degree, we'll have some transition services agreements as they take on and migrate these businesses. So some of the expenses stay. Some of that will get offset in other items, but some of the expenses will stay as part of those agreements. So not everything transitions sort of day 1. That's sort of point number one.  Point number two on it is that, as you would expect, there's a portion of these expenses that are more shared across the organization. I use sort of corporate overhead just as an example. So it will take us a little longer to work the majority of that out. And so I characterize that as somewhere between 10% and 20% of it will take a little bit longer. And then I guess, lastly, as we sort of get to closing on these deals, we'll be transparent and provide an update to our guidance on how these will impact it. Saul Martinez : Got it. But if we're thinking about 2022 in relation to the sort of the ongoing expense run rate, which was reflected in the $53 billion, really, the $1.7 billion, I'm just looking at Asset Management and Corporate Trust, the bulk of that should, by that point, assuming the deal is closed, should, call it, I don't know, 80%, 90% of that, should be out of the run rate by next year? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, subject to any impact from transition services agreements. Saul Martinez : Got it. Right. Michael Santomassimo : So as we get closer, we'll give you more guarantee on that. Saul Martinez : Which we would get paid for in revenue. Michael Santomassimo : Yes, yes, yes. As Charlie said, in most cases, for these transition service agreements, we'll have some expense still there, but we'll get reimbursed. And the way the accounting works on that is just geography. We'll get some revenue and offset by these expenses. Saul Martinez : Is there a reason why these are not placed in discontinued operations until the deal closes? Michael Santomassimo : Well, I think we moved Asset Management to Corporate, and so we moved it out of the segment that it's in. And as I noted on the call, we'll move Corporate Trust out of the Commercial Banking segment in the second quarter. So you'll be able to clearly see sort of the impact of it in the operating segments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Mike, two quick cleanup items. Just on the tax rate, can you remind us what's making the tax rate low this year and whether the reserve releases put some upward pressure on that? And then more importantly, what -- is it sustainably low as you look out into further years because of tax-advantaged investments? Or is part of it profitability related? Just give us the factors there. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. The biggest impact, John, on the tax rate, relative to kind of the marginal rate that we've got is the impact we get from the tax credits we get on our low-income housing and renewable energy investments. And as you can see from the K disclosures, those are -- those have been growing year after year, and they grew -- they will -- we expect them to grow in 2021 as well. And those are what they are, right? There's no -- those are pretty easy for us to identify and forecast, and that's the biggest piece of what's bringing down the effective tax rate. And that -- those will -- those credits will continue. Obviously, the more pre-tax income that we have above and beyond what we expect will sort of be at the marginal tax rate. And so presumably, if we -- obviously, theoretically, earn more money, then you'll see that effective tax rate sort of inch up over time. John McDonald : Okay. And then just on the mortgage outlook, you mentioned... Charles Scharf : John, this is Charlie. The only one I'd add on that is just -- and Mike, you can correct me. The reserve releases affect the rate, but the size of our total tax number, not that big. Again, the substantial impact on the lower rate is the dollar benefit that we get from these tax-advantaged investments that we have. And as Mike said, just on income going forward, think about it in terms of the marginal rate. John McDonald : Got it. So you're still expecting a single-digit tax rate this year, Mike, correct? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Yes. No. At this point, that's the case. John McDonald : Okay. And then just to clarify on the mortgage outlook, Mike, I think you said like the industry might be down in volume, but you guys expect to buck that a little bit because of some of the retail strength you have. Or were you kind of just saying that you'll be down a little bit but still robust? If you could just clarify your outlook on mortgage, that would be great. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Look, the industry data, typically, their forecast lagged a little bit relative to what the industry is actually seeing. And so I think the industry is projecting that second quarter is going to be down a little bit, but we'll see how that sort of plays out over the coming weeks in terms of what their forecasts are. But I think based on what we're seeing on our pipeline, we feel like it will be a pretty robust quarter on the origination side. You're likely to see that gain-on-sale margins come down, but we're likely to see an increase in volume as well. So... Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Just a couple of cleanup ones, just a little bit further on mortgage banking. Mike, since you just answered that partly. The question I have is Ginnie Mae buyouts. You talked about that boosting your mortgage banking gains. How much was that? And because then that could give us a sense of what did your gain-on-sale margin do in Q1 versus Q4? And how much are you expecting that gain-on-sale margin -- I'm sorry, the Ginnie Mae buyouts to continue in the next couple of quarters, how much more to do? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I think, Vivek, I don't have the number in front of me on the impact from the buyouts, but I would also sort of point out -- so we can follow up with you after. But I would also point out that the early buyouts, as we re-securitize them, that impacts sort of our balance as well, sort of our loan balance in Home Lending. And so I think that's another big driver. And we give you some data in the Qs in terms of what those balances look like quarter-to-quarter. So we would expect that over the coming quarters, that we're going to continue to re-securitize more of those loans. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And then the second one for both of you. I saw the numbers on the expected gain on sale on the businesses, well, the Asset Management and Corporate Trust. Is that net of goodwill? Or is that -- would we need to adjust a goodwill write-down on that, and that will obviously play into your share buybacks?  And, Charlie, given that we're all anticipating the asset cap to be lifted at some point, how are you thinking about the pace of share buybacks since that will give you an opportunity to put some of that capital to work in terms of growing the balance sheet, too? Don't worry, I'm not trying to pin you down on timing of asset cap getting lifted, but just the... Michael Santomassimo : Yes. So Vivek, I'll start there. So I don't want to get wonky on accounting, but the way we accounted for the student loan business was the sale of the portfolio. And so there was a goodwill write-down that showed discretely in the P&L and how that flows through. As you sort of look at the Corporate Trust business sale and the Asset Management sale, you won't have a corresponding write-down of the goodwill, the gains, net of all -- everything that goes into exiting there, so you don't need to adjust for that. I think as it comes to sort of the asset cap question, we'll go back to our stock answer around not -- sort of not commenting on that at all, other than the fact that, as Charlie has said a couple of times on the call, that we're -- it's our top priority, and we're continuing to do whatever we need to do to sort of work our way through that. And we continue to believe we're making good progress there. And as you sort of look at our capital and liquidity levels, we've got a significant -- continue to have a significant amount of excess capital. So... Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales. Charles Peabody : Yes. I have two questions, 1 on cards and 1 on NII. On the card front, you mentioned that you are punching below your weight. And just curious, you're hearing from a lot of the card companies and JPMorgan this morning that they're going to really accelerate their marketing spend on cards in the second half of the year. So are you expecting to grow -- how are you expecting to gain market share? Is it pricing, rewards? How are you going to improve your relative position in that business? Charles Scharf : Sure. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. I would say -- first of all, I would say, again, kind of like my comments on the Corporate and Investment Bank, when we think about the opportunity, we're not talking about doing anything that is materially different from a risk perspective for the company. The way we look at it is we have a business today which has $35-ish billion of receivables. When you look at the size of the consumer base that we touch across the franchise, it's hugely substantial, and we're hugely underpenetrated, even though we do have a reasonable-size business to start out with. Ultimately, when you look at what we do as a card company, the fact is our card propositions are not competitive what is available today in the marketplace or where people are going. When we look at our -- things that we do on fraud, when we look at our customer service, every step of the way, we think we have opportunities to make material improvements in what our offerings look like which will make our products far more attractive for those that currently have the products so that it becomes their primary product but also more attractive for the customers that we currently touch.  And so it's a very, very -- it's -- we're very, very clear about what we think we've got to do to increase that penetration. In a lot of ways, it's very, very basic because we're building on something which is particularly uncompetitive, which I just look at like it creates great opportunity for us. Charles Peabody : And as a follow-up question on NII, I believe you guys have modeled scenarios for negative rates at the short end. Can you share some of your findings on that? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Look, negative rates in the short end won't have a significant impact on us at all. I think we have the outlet at the fed at 10 basis points, and so I don't see that being an impact for us. Operator : I'll now turn the conference back over to management for any concluding remarks. Charles Scharf : This is Charlie again. I just want to thank everyone for the time, and we look forward to talking to you during the quarter and then on the call next quarter. Take care. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thanks, John. Good morning. I will make some brief comments about our second quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I will then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail. Let me start with the second quarter. We are in $6 billion or $1.38 per common share in the second quarter. These results included $1.6 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses as credit quality continued to outperform our expectations. Charge-offs continued to decline as the economy continues to improve and our customers continue to have high levels of liquidity. Revenue increased compared with the first quarter. While net interest income was stable, we had sizable gains from equity securities and card and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting increased spending. Expenses declined, reflecting a decline in personnel expense, which is typically highest in the first quarter and progress on our efficiency initiatives. If you look through the reserve release and outsized gains from equity securities, we are pleased that our results continued to show progress, even though high levels of liquidity, weakness in supply chains and low interest rates remained as headwinds. Economic growth was robust in the second quarter with real GDP estimated to have increased at an 8% annual rate with especially strong gains in consumer spending. We continued to see supply chain shortages impacting both supply and prices across many sectors. Home prices are estimated to have increased at a 24% annual rate as scarcity of properties for sale persisted and half of unit sales exceeded asking price. Used car prices continued to increase due to ongoing supply constraints with the second quarter Manheim Index increasing 17% from first quarter 2021 and 45% from a year-ago. However, prices may have peaked in May after four consecutive months of record highs with June\u2019s Manheim Index finishing 1.3% lower than May. For Wells Fargo consumer customers, nearly $50 billion of federal stimulus payments from rounds two and three have been deposited into our customers\u2019 accounts and we estimate roughly 25% remained in their accounts as of July 2. For our customers who received stimulus payments, their median deposit balance was up 56% compared to April 2020, which is prior to the first round of federal stimulus payments. And for all of our customers, including customers who did not receive stimulus payments, median balances were up 49% over that same time period. Weekly debit card spend was up every week compared to 2019 during the second quarter and areas hardest hit by the pandemic have recovered, including travel, up 11%; entertainment, up 38%; and restaurant spending up 28% during the week ending June 25 compared with 2019. Consumer credit card spending activity continued to increase, up 13% in the second quarter compared to 2019. As of the weekend to June 25, travel-related spending, which was hardest hit during the pandemic, was up significantly from 2020, but was the only category that has not fully rebounded to 2019 levels. Our commercial banking clients have also continued to have high levels of cash on hand and accommodative capital markets and supply chain disruptions continued \u2013 to a continued decline in commercial banking loans outstanding albeit at a slower pace than the last few quarters. Now that we are halfway through the year, let me update you on progress we\u2019ve made in the areas I highlighted at the beginning of the year. I\u2019ve spoken at every call about our most important initiative, making progress on risk and control. Wells Fargo\u2019s top priority continues to be building the right foundation for a company of our size and complexity. When done, this should meet our regulatory requirements and we remain committed to devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the highest levels of integrity and have appropriate control \u2013 an appropriate culture in place. The amount of customer remediation and control-related issues that existed when I arrived was many multiples of what should exist at our company. I\u2019ve spoken of what we put in place to address these issues and by most metrics, we are making significant progress. Regarding our work on consent orders and other regulatory requirements, the work remaining is significant and as such, this remains a multi-year journey for us. While what\u2019s required for each is clear, there are numerous complexities with managing this amount of work concurrently, and it will take time to consistently accomplish all at the level we and our regulators expect. As such, we may have setbacks and progress will not be a straight line. However, I remain confident in our ability to complete the work. Building a strong management team was another key priority. When I first joined Wells, our objective was to ensure we have the talent necessary to close our risk and control gaps. During the first half of my tenure, around 60% of senior level hires were in these functions and many more across the company directed their efforts towards these activities. This remains our most important priority today. We will continue to add resources here, but we are also adding significant resources to improve our competitiveness and provide the foundation for higher levels of performance. During the second half of my tenure, while we\u2019ve continued to hire senior leaders in risk and control areas, we\u2019ve been increasing our hiring in areas that will grow our business with over 70% of our senior level hires focused on this objective. This includes significant hires in the data platform and analytics, strategy, digital and our technology groups. We are focused on the cloud, payments, FinTech competition, tech companies and our own data and digital capabilities. Hires include a Digital Platform leader for all of our consumer businesses, a Head of Digital for Commercial Banking and the CIB, Head of Strategy and Innovation for Consumer and Small Business Banking, Head of our Commercial Auto Group, Head of Consumer Banking National Business Development and a new Head of Payment Strategies for the entire company. We are also adding bankers in the CIB and commercial bank where we see growth opportunities. We also just announced last week that we\u2019ve hired Bei Ling as the new Head of Human Resources. She will be joining us in October. And providing clear business focus and strategic direction has been important as well as we allocate our resources. We will not do anything to jeopardize our control-related work, but we have also begun to execute on plans to build what\u2019s necessary to compete effectively in today\u2019s dynamic business environment. Our playbook was dated and was time to provide direction and be more aggressive about building leading products, capabilities and innovating. We\u2019ve been focused on targeting our resources to what\u2019s most meaningful today for our customers by selling or closing businesses and we are leveraging our breadth and scale to compete with banks and non-banks alike by working to build new capabilities and work across the company to deliver all of Wells Fargo to our customer base. We are rebuilding core capabilities, but are beginning to instill a mobile-first mindset as part of our broader technology and data guided efforts. One example is our credit card business where we\u2019ve been working on it since I arrived to build a foundation to compete more effectively. Being competitive here is both an opportunity to grow, but more importantly is a strategic comparative as credit and payments are critical to maintain and build customer relationships, and we\u2019ll do this with both traditional card products and other ways over time. Our playbook is simple. Build an experienced management team, update and relaunch product customers who\u2019ll make top of wallet, improve customer service and leverage both our branches and strong digital capabilities to serve our customers. In the second quarter, we announced the first new product of several to come, an industry-leading cashback card, which is now just rolling out. We are also enhancing our deposit products. Our no-overdraft product, Clear Access Banking continued to perform well with over 825,000 accounts opened since the launch in the third quarter of last year. We also simplified and improved the benefits of our portfolio by Wells Fargo checking customers in the second quarter this year. These are just a few examples of how we are moving forward, but we have initiatives across all businesses, which we will cover over time. And lastly, we continue to take meaningful actions and are progressing towards better returns. As we highlighted at the beginning of the year, we see a path to get to double-digit ROTCE excluding credit loss reserve releases and then moving towards approximately 15%. We said that the path to double-digit ROTCE is dependent on capital optimization and executing on our efficiency initiatives. With CCAR complete and a return to the SCB framework, we are now in a position to return significant capital to shareholders. We expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend to $0.20 per share subject to final Board approval. Increasing our dividend is a priority and our plan contemplates continued increases as we grow earnings capacity. Additionally, our capital plan included approximately $18 billion of gross common share repurchases starting in the third quarter and concluding in the second quarter of next year. This may change depending on a variety of factors including our earnings and economic outlook. Mike will provide more context here. Importantly, we remain on target to accomplish the expense reductions contemplating and achieving the double-digit ROTCE level. Assuming no material changes in the economic environment or interest rates, we expect to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE excluding reserve releases and other special items both positive and negative on a run rate basis during 2022. Beyond this, we continue to believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors. Moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted, a modest increase in interest rates or further steepening of the curve, ongoing progress on incremental efficiency initiatives, a small impact from returns on growth-related investments in our businesses and continued execution on our risk regulatory and control framework. The combination of these factors we believe would take our ROTCE to approximately 15% over time. And while we are focused on improving our execution of results, we know that supporting our customers and communities will continue to be an important part of our mission. The work we did through the pandemic was meaningful and necessary to help those most in need especially consumers and small businesses, but there remains much more to do. We offered payment deferrals, waived fees, supported smaller and diverse small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. We committed to donate all gross processing fees from PPP loans funded in 2020 totaling approximately $420 million to help small businesses recovery efforts and have completed funding of $234 million of our commitment. We expect to fund the rest by the end of the year. We are also voluntarily extending our foreclosure moratorium on mortgage loans we own through the end of this year and we are pleased that the industry is contemplating similar foreclosure extensions. We issued our first Sustainability Bond, which will fund projects and programs that support housing affordability, socioeconomic opportunity and renewable energy. We partnered with diverse firms in the offering of our $1 billion Sustainability Bond with approximately 75% of the economics going into these firms, underscoring our commitment to supporting historically marginalized communities. We fulfilled the pledge that we made last year to commit $50 million to black-owned banks and communities across the country with investments in two additional African-American Minority Deposit Institutions during the second quarter. And we announced the Banking Inclusion Initiative, a 10-year commitment to help unbanked individual gain access to affordable transaction accounts. This is a complex and longstanding issue that will require gathering the best minds, ideas, products and educational resources from across our communities to bring about change and help remove barriers to financial inclusion. In summary, let me say that the outlook for the economy for the rest of the year is promising, assuming continued success against COVID. The restocking of inventories is expected to be substantial and the excess personal savings should provide a cushion for consumer spending. However, risks remain, interest rates have been volatile and the recent rally in rates is putting pressure on net interest income. We\u2019ve made meaningful progress in our important priorities during the first half of the year, but this is just the start of a multi-year process to transform Wells Fargo. I want to thank everyone at Wells for their hard work and focus on supporting our customers. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Charlie highlighted many of the ways we are actively helping our customers and communities on Slide 2, so I\u2019m going to start with our second quarter financial results on Slide 3. Net income for the quarter was $6 billion or $1.38 per common share. As Charlie highlighted, our second quarter results included $1.6 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses. Pre-tax, pre-provision profit grew from both a year-ago and from the first quarter as we grew revenue and reduced expenses. We had $2.7 billion or approximately $2 billion after non-controlling interests of pre-tax equity gains predominantly coming from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, approximately $2 billion was due to unrealized gains from follow-on financing rounds reflecting significantly higher valuations in a number of portfolio companies. The remaining approximately $700 million was realized gains. Given the nature of these businesses, these gains tend to be episodic however, since 2017 these businesses have generated annual gains in excess of $1 billion in every year except 2020, which was impacted by the pandemic. We completed the sale of student loans in the second quarter, which resulted in a $140 million gain and a $79 million write-down related goodwill. Our effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 19.3%, which reflected accounting policy changes for certain tax-advantaged investments. We elected to make these changes to better align the financial statement presentation of the economic impact of these investments with the related tax credits. Prior period financial statement line items have been revised, which had a nominal impact in net income on an annual basis. The changes did improve our efficiency ratio and increased our effective income tax rate from what was previously reported. We provide details regarding these changes on Slide 16 in the appendix of this deck and on Page 30 of the quarterly supplement. Reflecting these changes, we expect our effective income tax rate for the full-year to be approximately 20%. Our CET1 ratio increased to 12.1% in the second quarter. This year CCAR stress test confirmed the significant strength of our capital position. Based on the results, we expect our stress capital buffer to increase 60 basis points effective in the fourth quarter of this year. And as a reminder, our G-SIB capital surcharge will decrease by 50 basis points effective in the first quarter of next year, which will bring our CET1 regulatory minimum to 9.1% in the first quarter of 2022. As Charlie highlighted, we plan to return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders starting in the third quarter and expect to move closer to our internal target of 100 basis points above the regulatory minimum over time. We also currently expect to maintain an incremental buffer of 25 basis points to 50 basis points above our target to account for potential uncertainties and maintain flexibility. Under the SCB framework, we will have flexibility to increase capital distributions and if possible, we will be able to repurchase more than the $18 billion included in our capital plan over the four-quarter period depending on market conditions and other risk factors, including COVID-related risks. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our net charge-off ratio in the second quarter declined 18 basis points. The improving economic environment with the reopening of the economy, government stimulus and ample liquidity as well as customer accommodations have resulted in our credit losses continuing to trend significantly better than our expectations. Commercial credit performance continued to improve and loan charge-offs declined $69 million from the first quarter to 7 basis points, our lowest loss rates since the second quarter of 2018. The improvement was broad-based with declines in all commercial asset types, including net recoveries and commercial real estate. While the overall outlook for commercial real estate continued to improve, we remain focused on the areas most impacted by the pandemic. The reopening of the economy has continued to have a positive impact on retail and hotel as cash flow has improved. While losses and problem loans and office have been very low, we continue to monitor this sector as longer-term demand trends maybe influenced by changes in hybrid work-from-home models. It\u2019s also important to note that even with the reserve release in the second quarter our coverage ratio for commercial real estate loans was still higher than it was a year-ago.  Consumer net loan charge-offs declined from both the first quarter and a year-ago to 32 basis points in the second quarter. Non-performing assets declined $695 million or 8% from the first quarter driven by lower commercial non-accruals. Declines in C&I non-accruals were driven by improvements across a number of COVID impacted sectors, including entertainment and recreation, energy, transportation services and retail. Declines in commercial real estate were driven by improvements in office. A year-ago, $37.2 billion of our consumer loan portfolio, excluding government insured or guaranteed loans was in COVID-related payment deferral. Deferrals have declined 79% from a year-ago to $7.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. We stopped offering non-real estate related COVID deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2020, but continue to offer certain COVID-related deferrals in home lending for a maximum of 18 months. It\u2019s important to note that loans have already exited COVID \u2013 that have already exited COVID-related deferrals have continued to perform better than we anticipated with approximately 94% of the balances current as of the end of the second quarter. We started to tighten our credit policies in March 2020 in response to the pandemic and we have now essentially returned back to pre-COVID levels or policies. However, we continue to be thoughtful of the much higher asset prices in areas like residential real estate and auto. Due to the reserve release in the quarter, our allowance coverage ratio declined from both the first quarter and a year-ago. Similar to the first quarter, while observed credit performance was strong, there were still significant uncertainty reflected in our allowance level at the end of the second quarter, and we will continue to assess the level of our coverage. If current economic trends continue, we would expect to have additional reserve releases. On Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Although average loans declined in the quarter, the rate of declines slowed with balances down $18.7 billion or 2% from the first quarter. The decline from the first quarter was almost entirely driven by lower residential real estate loans, primarily due to continued high prepayments and the re-securitization of loans we purchased out of mortgage-backed securities last year. The total period end loans were down 1% from the first quarter. And while it\u2019s hard to predict exactly what will happen during the second half of the year and while line utilization rates remain low, we are seeing signs of green shoots with modest growth in period end balances compared to the first quarter in auto, other consumer, credit card and commercial real estate. Average deposits increased $49.1 billion or 4% from a year-ago and 3% from the first quarter with growth in our Consumer businesses and Commercial Banking partially offset by continued declines in Corporate Investment Banking and Corporate Treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Now turning to net interest income on Slide 7. Net interest income was stable from the first quarter, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, higher income due to additional forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program or PPP loans and one additional day in the quarter was offset by lower loan balances and the impact of lower interest rates. As we think about net interest income for the remainder of the year, the rate volatility observed over the last few weeks have shown how difficult it can be to forecast even for the next couple of quarters. The key drivers continue to be demand for loans and balance sheet yields, which are impacted by the level of rates, the shape of the curve and credit spreads. While the recent rally in rates and continued softness in loan demand have put downward pressure on net interest income, we still expect NII for the full-year to remain in the range of flat to down 4% from the originally reported and annualized fourth quarter of 2020 level of $36.8 billion. Where in the range we end up will be dependent on the factors I mentioned. If rates follow the current forward curve and overall loan balances remained flat from the period end balance at the end of the second quarter for the remainder of the year, which would require modest growth in commercial loans, we would expect net interest income to be in the lower end of the range. If we see rates back up from here and start to see more loan growth, we will move up in the range. We continue to closely monitor the evolving trends across each of the major drivers of net interest income and we will provide updates to our outlook as the year progresses. Turning to expenses on Slide 8. Non-interest expense declined 8% from a year-ago, primarily driven by lower operating losses and also reflected the progress we\u2019ve made on our efficiency initiatives. Let me highlight a few examples. Our customers are increasingly leveraging our digital capabilities with mobile active customers up 6% from a year-ago and the number of checks deposited using mobile growing 9% from a year ago. These changes and others have enabled us to adjust branch staffing and you can see this coming through with lower headcount and expenses in the Consumer Banking and Lending segment. Importantly, to date, we\u2019ve been able to make these adjustments, while improving client satisfaction. We reduced the number of our locations, including branches and offices by 5% since the start of the year, a reduction of over 2 million square feet. We also recently agreed to sell our tower in downtown Phoenix, which includes over 500,000 square feet. We continue to evaluate owned locations and locations with upcoming lease expirations for closure and consolidation opportunities. We reduced professional and outside services expense by 14% during the first half of this year compared to a year-ago. This reduction was driven by lower spend on consultants and contractors on various projects across the company. In Commercial Banking, we\u2019ve made progress on changing how we serve our customers, optimizing our operations and other back-office teams and reducing the number of Commercial Banking and Lending platforms. These efforts were reflected in lower headcount expenses in this segment. We are on track in executing our efficiency plans included in our expense outlook of approximately $53 billion. Our outlook excluded restructuring charges and the cost of business exits, which totaled $192 million during the first half of this year and included a $1 billion of operating losses, which totaled just over $500 million during the first half of the year. Keep in mind, operating losses can be lumpy and unpredictable and especially as we continue to address the significant work left to do to satisfy our regulatory requirements. We also assumed approximately $500 million of incremental revenue-related expenses and these have been higher than expected so far this year due to strong equity markets, which is a good thing, as the associated revenue more than offsets any increase in expenses. If current market levels hold, we would expect incremental revenue-related compensation to be approximately $1 billion, which could put us over $53 billion. We\u2019ll continue to update you as the year progresses. Turning to our business segments starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 9. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 7% from a year-ago, primarily due to higher debit card transaction volume and higher deposit-related fees, which were lower in 2020 due to fee waivers provided at the onset of the pandemic. Home lending revenue increased 40% from a year-ago, driven by higher servicing income as last year we had a significant negative valuation adjustment to our mortgage servicing rights asset. We also had higher origination and sales revenue in the second quarter due to higher gains from the re-securitization of loans we purchased from mortgage-backed securities last year and an increase in retail originations. The 7% decline in revenue from the first quarter was primarily due to lower retail held-for-sale originations and gain-on-sale margins. Gain-on-sale margins are expected to continue to decline in the second half of the year.  Credit card revenue increased 14% from a year-ago, driven by increased spending. Additionally, in response to the pandemic, second quarter 2020 included higher customer accommodations and fee waivers. Auto revenue increased 7% from a year-ago in higher loan balances. Now turning to some key business drivers on Slide 10. While we believe mortgage originations in the industry declined from the first quarter, our mortgage originations increased 3%. A decline in correspondent originations was more than offset by growth in retail, with an increase in retail held for investment volume, partially offset by lower held-for-sale line. Our second quarter retail mortgage origination volume increased 10% from first quarter and was the highest since 2015. We currently expect third quarter originations to decline modestly although refinancing volumes to be stronger than currently forecasted with the recent rate rally if lower rates persist. We also expect our retail originations to decline less than the industry as we\u2019ve improved capability to serve our customers\u2019 mortgage financing needs. Consumer demand for auto loans continue to be very strong despite higher prices and limited inventory. Auto originations increased 19% from the first quarter and 48% from a year-ago with June setting a new monthly record for originations exceeding our previous highs in June of 2016. Turning to debit card. Purchase volume increased 12% from the first quarter and 31% from a year-ago, reflecting higher consumer spending due to stimulus payments and improving economic conditions. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 21% from the first quarter as the economy continued to open and in May, we had our highest monthly spending volume in recent history. The increased activity has not yet translated into significantly higher balances as payment rates remain high. On Slide 11, the Commercial Banking results are highlighted. It excludes the Corporate Trust business, which is now reported in Corporate and prior periods have been revised. Middle Market Banking revenue declined 9% from a year-ago, primarily due to the impact of lower loan balances and lower interest rates, which were partially offset by higher deposit balances and deposit-related fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 12% from a year-ago driven by the impact of lower loan balances, which was partially offset by improved loan spreads, higher net gains on equity securities in our strategic capital business and higher revenue from our renewable energy investments. Non-interest expense declined 9% from a year-ago, primarily driven by lower salaries and consulting expense. Average loans declined for the fourth consecutive quarter and were down 22% from a year-ago. The demand for loans declined due to low client inventory levels and strong client cash positions. While there are some green shoots in select industries, demand has not yet picked up. Average balances were up 5% from a year-ago, reflecting significant liquidity from stimulus programs. Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 12. In banking, total revenue declined 6% from a year-ago. The decrease was driven by lower debt capital markets revenue, the impact of lower interest rates and lower deposit balances predominantly due to actions taken to manage under the asset cap. Commercial real estate revenue grew 21% from a year-ago, driven by higher CMBS gain-on-sale margins and volumes. Commercial real estate capital markets transaction volume increased significantly from a year-ago driven by low rates, tighter loan spreads, excess liquidity in the market and stable improving real estate fundamentals. While acquisition activity picked up in the second quarter, loan demand was predominantly driven by refinance activity. Markets revenue declined 45% from a year-ago from lower trading activity across most asset classes compared to the higher trading activity we experienced in the second quarter of 2020 as the markets recovered due to the monetary and fiscal stimulus in response to the pandemic. Our markets revenue has been negatively impacted by actions we\u2019ve taken to manage under the asset cap as well. Non-interest expense declined 12% from a year-ago, primarily driven by lower operating losses. Average deposits declined 20% from a year-ago, primarily driven by continued actions we\u2019ve taken to manage under the asset cap. On Slide 13, we have Wealth and Investment Management, which grew revenue by 10% in the second quarter compared with a year-ago. Non-interest income was up 18% from a year-ago, primarily driven by higher asset-based fees on higher market valuations, which was partially offset by lower net interest income driven by lower interest rates. Revenue-related compensation drove the increase in non-interest expense compared with a year-ago. We ended the second quarter with record client assets of $2.1 trillion, up 20% from a year-ago, reflecting strong market performance. Average deposits were up 6% from a year-ago and average loans increased 5% from a year-ago due to customer demand for securities-based lending offerings. Slide 14 highlights our Corporate results, revenue growth from a year-ago and from the first quarter was driven by the equity gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses that I highlighted earlier in the call, second quarter results also benefited from the gain on the sale of student loans and a modest gain on the sale of our Canadian equipment finance business. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hey. Good morning. Charles Scharf : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Can you hear me okay? Charles Scharf : Yes. Betsy Graseck : All right. Thanks. Hey, so I did just want to understand a little bit about the commentary that you\u2019re making earlier around the 10% ROTCE that you're expecting you will be able to do that in 2022 without reserve release, which is \u2013 seemingly a pretty bold statement given what consensus is looking for. If I ex out the reserve release, it feels like there's a percentage point or so differential there. Can you help us understand what the drivers are going to be to do that? And if it's in the expenses, can you give us some sense as to which parts of your business is going to be feeding that 10% most? Thanks. Charles Scharf : Yes. So let me start out and then Mike can chime in. I guess, the way we thought about it is to just \u2013 let's first start and think about the earnings of this quarter and do our best to look through all of those things, which we know aren't really recurring. And so if you think about the sale of the student loan business, the change in allowance, and even \u2013 obviously, we've got those outsized gains in NEP, NVP. But at the same time, we don't assume they go to zero over the course of the following year. And then you could even normalize for charge-offs, getting them to somewhat of a higher level. But if you do that, what we've said is that with our expense reductions that we've contemplated with the ability to return capital, you can get to that level. And so we've obviously had the ability now to return to significant amount of excess capital that we have. That's an extremely meaningful driver of the improvement in ROTCE, and it's a \u2013 I think about it is like a somewhat modest improvement and the rest of the performance to get there from \u2013 in terms of the company from where we sit today. So we don't want to talk in any level of specificity at this point about the specifics about expenses. But we're working extremely hard not just to get the efficiencies that were important to meet our expectations for this year, but to position us properly next year to reduce expenses on a net basis while we have the ability to invest significantly inside the company. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. And I would just point out, Betsy. It's not a full-year 2022. What he said was it\u2019s the run rate in 2022 at some point, right, so? Charles Scharf : Yes. Betsy Graseck : Right. So it could be your 4Q exit run rate? Michael Santomassimo : Could be. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just separately, could you speak to the flexibility on the buybacks? I know you indicated that $18 billion or $18.5 billion under the SCB framework. Should we be taking that as a minimum buyback level? Because I think that reflects your ask in the \u2013 or at least what you \u2013 not in ask, but what you put into the test, and you've got earnings that you're generating and the environments improving. So could you imagine that buybacks could be higher than that over the course of the next four quarters? Charles Scharf : Yes. I think the signal is that it could be higher or lower depending on exactly how our results turn out and what we think the outlook for the economy is and potentially where the stock price is even though that's really not a factor in our thinking today given our view of the valuation. We obviously would hope that it would be more, not less and we have the flexibility under the SCB framework to do that. So I think you all can do your calculations on what you think we'll learn next year. We've given you the guidelines for how we're thinking about where we're targeting our capital ratios to be, and we'd like to \u2013 we don't see any need to have excess capital sitting around the company at this point, especially given the fact that we have the asset cap. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Okay. Charlie, Mike, thanks so much. Appreciate it. Charles Scharf : Sure. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hey. Good afternoon. So I wanted to start-off with a question just on the headcount trajectory. You started to make some real progress, driving some of the headcount reductions that you've spoken to. It sounds about 6% year-on-year, but if I look \u2013 comp you against the peer group, BoA probably being the closest comp. You still have 50,000 more employees despite a similar business mix and scale. I recognize that certainly some of that's going to be tied to the consent order. But I was hoping, Charlie, you can maybe just give us some context or perspective on. As you start to execute on the plan of optimizing that headcount, what's the right level to support your strategic vision for the franchise? Charles Scharf : Yes. I think it's a great question. I think your numbers are accurate for sure. Just a couple of things I'd say. I think, first of all, you can imagine we try and do all those numbers ourselves. And between other places that we've all worked at the senior management team, it is very hard to get apples-to-apples because different people in-source different functions. And so \u2013 but directionally, your point is still right. So I'm not sure the magnitude is exactly right versus just Bank of America. But directionally, I think it's a fair statement. And I think that is a simple driver that gets everyone's attention here as well as, frankly, just as we look around the company and we see our processes and we see the things that we haven't done nearly as well. And so that's why when we think about the future that we have, we still continue to believe that there are significant efficiencies on a gross basis that we'll be able to continue to drive out the company. Over time, we would love to do as much of it through natural attrition as possible given the size of the company, we have significant attrition. And people self-select because of how we're going about doing things. But I think \u2013 we think about where we're going and our ability to reinvest in the company. We think that there's a lot there. And I think, again, as we get towards the end of the year, we'll talk about next year with some more specificity and at some point give you a little more clarity. I think we're still in the stage of peeling the onion back. And every time you peel a layer of the onion back, you see the next layer even more clearly. And I think we're still in that stage. But it does give us a pretty good feeling about our ability to continue to drive this forward. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that perspective, Charlie. And just for my follow-up on the NII outlook. Mike, I was hoping you could just unpack the NII guidance a bit further. Specifically, what is the contemplate in terms of premium am and excess liquidity deployment? And are there - is there any noise relating to some of the loan sales that could drive some volatility in the back half as we think about the trajectory? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. There is no noise from loan sale per se. But let me break out aspects of it and kind of talk through what was included there. So obviously the curve is going to be an important element of it. And what we said in the remarks, right, at this point, we're assuming it's about where it is, right. It's been bouncing around the last few days, but sort of think about it as about where it is right now. And then as you sort of look forward on loans and you assume that overall loan stay sort of flattish where we exited the quarter, that does require a little bit of growth \u2013 modest growth on the commercial side. And so that's sort of embedded in the assumption. I think on premium amor, you saw it come down a bit in the quarter versus the first quarter, we're still expecting that to come down. I think it could bounce around slightly versus what the assumptions are given where rates are, but we think the direction is still the right direction. And then you may have a little bit of noise between Q3 and Q4 given some of the PPP related forgiveness that may happen. But that's sort of what we're assuming overall to get to and that gets you towards the bottom of the range that we've given. Hopefully, we're surprised by loan growth or a backup in rates again. But that's we're assuming at this point. Steven Chubak : That's great color. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Thanks. Hey, Mike, on the mortgage business, I wanted to ask you, you said that you had the loans that were in the loan book that you moved into and resecuritized. Can you help us understand how much of a benefit that might've been in mortgage banking this quarter and just your general outlook for origination trends and what's happening in the gain-on-sale market? Thank you. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Good questions, Ken. So I'll try and pick it. If I miss something, let me know. But as you sort of think about gain-on-sale, the gain-on-sale continues to come down each quarter and we would expect that to continue. And at this point, what that's driven by is just the capacity that's been built up in the industry and as people get a little more competitive on price, that's going to drive gain-on-sale down. Now, I think what you've also seen us do there is really focused on the retail channel. And to some degree deemphasize the correspondent channel or use it to kind of fill in the capacity that we've got. And so that should be helpful as we sort of think about gain-on-sale, but the direction is certainly going down. And I think, as I said at this point, I think it's really capacity-driven more than anything else from here forward. As you look at the \u2013 and I also said in the remarks that we think origination volumes were going to be down a bit in Q3 versus Q2. Now there is lots of different prognostications on the market. We think based on what we're seeing, we think we'll be down less than the market. But nonetheless, will be a little bit down. Now, if we could see a little bit of a gap of refi activity that could change that a little bit. But right now, we think it's probably down just a little. As you look at the impact of the [ETDO] gains, it was about $150 million increase on a linked quarter basis. We do expect to continue to have some gains in the third and fourth quarter. It probably comes down a bit from where it was in the second quarter as we sort of look quarter-by-quarter, but maybe a little bit less than what it increased versus the first quarter, but we do expect those to continue. And you'll see, we've still got about a little under $20 billion of those loans on the balance sheet. And you'll see the exact number when we put out the Q. Kenneth Usdin : All right. Great. Thanks. And just one follow-up on consumer-related fees. Good to see the deposit-related side and card rebounding. Can you just talk about the type of momentum that you're seeing there and just \u2013 or should we expect ongoing improvements from here in those areas? Thanks. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Look, it\u2019s just activity levels picking up and you can see that in the card volume metrics that we put out there. And so I think, assuming, we continue to see the recovery take hold and activity levels pick up and there should be \u2013 those are highly correlated there, so\u2026 Charles Scharf : And this is Charlie, I would just add. I would say slightly different dynamics on debit and credit, right. Debit, if you look at the remarks that I made, consumers still have a substantial amount of cash you see it in overall deposit levels and the willingness to spend as things open up, it\u2019s certainly what you're saying. And so that should continue to drive debit spend upward. And then credit is having similar benefits from reopening that the whole industry is seeing. Kenneth Usdin : Understood. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. John Pancari : Good morning. I want to see if you can give a little bit more color just around the loan growth outlook. Maybe if you can talk about commercial versus consumer on the commercial side? Are you starting to see utilization trends turn and as CapEx beginning to contribute to some increased willingness to draw down? And then on the consumer side, just curious what you're seeing in terms of payment rates specifically in the card businesses? Or are we starting to see the payment rates inflect? And do you think that's sustainable? Thanks. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Hey, John, it's Michael. I'll take that and Charlie can jump in if he wants. I'll try to pick it apart piece by piece. In the commercial bank loans are still down and utilization rates are pretty low on a historic basis. And I think overall that has not inflected yet. And there's lots of reasons, high liquidity, supply chain issues, demand for product in certain industries. Lots of things that sort of underpin that, but we haven't really seen that influx yet. There's a little bit of maybe differences by size of clients or by sector, but overall it's still not quite there yet. Now there is lots of good conversations, so I think people are really thinking about investments and really are thinking about building inventory levels over the coming quarters. But I think that'll take some time before it starts to translate into loan growth in the commercial bank. In the corporate investment bank, we do see loans there are up a little bit. So you're seeing some activity in subscription, finance, real estate and a few places. But again, relatively small so far, but you are seeing a little bit of activity there and we'll see how that progresses. On the consumer side, I know, a lot of others are talking about this too. If you look at through the end of period balances, you're seeing a little bit of growth in auto. We had a really good quarter from an origination point of view in the auto business, but it's a relatively small portfolio in the scheme of the balance sheet. You're seeing little bit of growth in card. Although the activity has really picked up there, it hasn't quite translated into bigger volumes given the payment rates as you sort of pointed out. Payment rates are still really high. And I think they'll come down and normalize eventually, but they're still pretty high. So I think we'll see how that progresses. And then we still expect a further decline albeit at a much slower pace in the home lending space as we work out of the EPB \u2013 the early buyout loans and see prepayment activity start to stabilize in that business. So we'll see how it all comes together over the next quarter or two. John Pancari : Okay, Mike. Thanks. That's helpful. And then separately on the consumer front, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the rationale for exiting the personal credit lines as a product and if there's any other areas like that within your lending products suite that you might be considering similarly to exit? Thanks. Charles Scharf : Sure. This is Charlie. That was a product of a pretty exhaustive effort that we went through across the whole company to look at what we thought was core, where we had some kind of strategic advantage or where it really was important for the customer relationships as we look forward. And so out of that exercise came our decisions to sell corporate trust to exit the international wealth business, sell the asset management businesses and a couple of other things that we have announced. The things that we've announced to the things that we're actively working on and so there's really \u2013 there's nothing more in progress now. The way we looked at the business was quite simple. It was very, very small business for us. We have products in our card products as well as we're still in the personal loan business. And so we have the ability to continue to serve customers who either want access to credit or actual being able to draw down and fund it over term. And so again, the idea of just simplifying the company around focusing on products that are most important to the broadest set of customers. That's what led us to the decision. John Pancari : Got it. All right. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Mike, can you share with us \u2013 I think, I don't think you've addressed this. But your loan loss reserves remain very strong. You guys have very strong credit as evidenced by this quarter in the history of this company. And your reserves are about a 100 basis points I think above where they were at day one in January of 2020 when you guys did the CECL true up? Can you share with us the outlook for reserves? Could they get back down to that level? And if the outlook is even better than it was in January of 2020, could the reserves actually fall below the CECL levels? Charles Scharf : Yes. Look, Gerard, I think that's a \u2013 first on the reserves, we need to be reserve for a whole bunch of different scenarios on any given time. And so as we sort of look at the path that we're on, there's a lot to be optimistic about, but there are still some risks there that we need to be mindful of and from where we are today. But if things keep progressing, look we should have future releases as we have noted. As you think about where you end up, I think that's a hard thing to call right now in terms of any degree of certainty at a point in time because it will be a function of \u2013 as you mentioned, the outlook that you have at that point. The mix of your balance sheet and other factors that go into sort of the \u2013 your view on the future and what could happen. But could we end up a little bit higher, maybe could we end up a little bit lower, maybe \u2013 I think it's \u2013 they're all possible scenarios depending on what point in time you're talking about. And as you know, there's a lot of things like elements of the office market in commercial real estate, that'll take a while to really play out. And so we'll see how that progresses over time, but I think it will be a function of all those things of exactly where we end up. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. And I know this question is putting the cart before the horse and I'm not asking you guys to predict when the asset cap will be lifted. But when the asset cap is lifted, how do you think you'll proceed going forward? There's been some talk in the markets that some of your peer banks are being stretched with their supplementary leverage ratio. In fact, JPMorgan now has told us that this is their binding constraint. And you have to wonder if the wholesale deposit market is going to be disrupted because of this freeing up Wells Fargo without the asset cap may give you guys the opportunity to pick up some wholesale deposits. So again, not asking when the asset cap is going to be lifted, but how does it look after it is lifted? What are you guys thinking? Charles Scharf : Well, again, I think it's very hard to answer the question because as you know, we don't know the timing of the asset cap just as if we don't know the timing of any changes, which could potentially happen on SLR or the way other banks will deal with that. So there are a whole series of unknowns that go into the question that I'm not sure that we're in a position to answer this, quite frankly. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. And I would just add two things. If you think about the actions and we've been very public about this, a lot of the actions we've taken as a result of the asset cap is to work with clients to manage deposits to other vehicles or other institutions in some cases and we continue to do that. So there's likely to be opportunity there with clients and we've managed areas like our market's business down. And think a lot of that could be financing type trades. And some of that, we think there'll be demand at the right time. And so I think as you sort of look at that, there should be plenty of opportunity for us as we look forward. But as Charlie said exactly, what shape that will take is a little bit of a function of when it happens. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Appreciate the color. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: Hi guys. Some of those has been kind of weaved throughout the call. But I was hoping you could just put together. If we look at the next two or three years and obviously assuming you're well past the asset cap, what are some of the key organic revenue growth drivers for Wells Fargo and how meaningful can they be? You mentioned credit card, you just mentioned some of the markets and wholesale business, the wild card. But maybe kind of list like three or four of them if there are and what might move the needle as we think about the next few years because you're probably one of the few stories where yes, you've got leverage to rising rates, but there's also an organic cost opportunity like you talked about and probably from organic revenue opportunity too. So hoping it's just kind of packaged that together for us? Thanks. Charles Scharf : Yes. I appreciate the question. And again, so I'll just put aside the interest rate environment for a second. And I think, listen, the reality is for a \u2013 I'm not sure what the right period of time is, but I'll just say for a period of time, we have been laggards across most of our businesses at growing revenues. For many, many years we had very, very strong financial performance. It's been a while since that's been the case. And when you look at the underlying trends of the businesses, while I personally think we've done remarkably well in terms of our share stats across the franchise given all of this company has been through which says an awful lot about the people on the front lines that do it day in and day out. There's just been very little that we've really done to focus on growing the franchise. And I do want to be fair to everyone here, right, which is that given all the issues that we've had, whether it's sales practices and the consumer bank, as an example, Mary Mack\u2019s job when she was put into that role was to fix that problem, not to focus on growing the business. And we continue to have other issues around the company. So as we've talked about where our priorities are, as I said in my remarks, we understand that continuing to build the risk and control infrastructure and satisfy the regulatory requirements is a gate to a really successful future of ours that we need to get through. But at the same time, just answering your question, I really do believe the opportunities exist in every one of our core businesses. And when we go through and we think about the consumer segment again, we've been getting a reasonable share of deposit flow, not because we're pricing for it, not because we've done anything really interesting in our coverage model, our products are digital or anything like that. It's because of who we are in the relationships that we have. We need to alter the course by changing all the things that I just mentioned. And those are the things that we're actively working on the background \u2013 in the background, whether it's all of our digital capabilities with this mobile-first attitude, looking at all of our products and services, thinking about how we serve the different segments using the data and information that we have to become more targeted in our offerings, that should drive a different level of growth in the consumer business.  We've talked about the card businesses as one of the pieces of our consumer lending business. You pick the business. In our middle market business, we don't see much revenue growth both because of rates and because of balances there. And we do believe we're the best commercial lender in the country and the best at being in a position to serve those customers far more broadly. And so whether it's through improving our treasury management products or the work that we've talked about utilizing our CIB platform to sell investment bank products to these customers who we bank for decades is just a very meaningful opportunity for us. The CIB, we're not going to be all things to all people. When you look at our fees relative to the lending commitments that we have out there, just as a measure of opportunity, we're not even close to where a company with risk, our existing risk profile should be. And by the way, it's been \u2013 the team has been improving it, but we're not shy to say we want to improve it even more from here, focused by industry, focused by product, utilizing the competitive advantages that we have. So I really believe and I don't leave anyone out when the exact same thing, we've got online capabilities and [indiscernible] that we've completely underutilized. We have a platform for brokers that want to go independent, that we've completely underutilized and there too \u2013 all the things that Barry Sommers is doing to bring our platforms together, to be able to offer all of the best products across all the platforms, do a better job with things like security-based loans and mortgages, where our stats clearly lag the competition. Those are just some sound bites, but we really believe it's everywhere. And so that work is going on the background and hopefully what you'll start to see, like we've seen \u2013 like you've seen with credit card is you'll start to see things come to market. But again, nothing is going to jeopardize the risk work we have to do. Matthew O'Connor: So it obviously sounds very broad-based in terms of the opportunity, but any way to size it either if you didn't have the asset cap, your balance would be, say $200 billion bigger now or if loan growth for the industry is 4% over the next several years per year you can do 50% better than that. Just any sound bites on sizing or where you could be now if you didn't have it or [indiscernible] longer-term? Charles Scharf : Matt, honestly, like we're not even thinking about what life is like without the asset cap. We quantify for ourselves and what the impact is on having it in this environment because that's the reality of it. But there are plenty of opportunities. I mean, if you go through all the things that I spoke about before, very few of those require balance sheet. Now, it doesn't mean that there's not opportunity costs for having it, but that's not an excuse for us not to do some other things. And when we get to the future, we'll talk about it when we get there. Matthew O'Connor: Understood. Thank you. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. And Matt, I've quantified some of the actions we've taken in the past that in other forums. And so I'd go back to some of that, but it's significant, and it's hundreds of billions of dollars of actions we've taken to help manage through the asset cap. So that should give you a pretty good sense of what the impact has been. Matthew O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions Charlie and Mike. Quick clarification through your onset to this \u2013 the last question, as soon as Charlie has said you aren't contemplating life without the asset cap, does that mean that the $18 billion buyback that you're talking about in the CCAR that does not \u2013 that assumes the current situation, it does not assume the lift of the asset cap? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Vivek, that's what I think he meant was, we're not playing a bunch of what ifs, like where we would have been right now if like the asset cap wasn't in place, right. So I think that's \u2013 I would take that in that context. And I think as we sort of look for our capital planning, we're assuming that it's in place during the period. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Second quick one for you, Mike. Hedge ineffectiveness gain you meant \u2013 how much was it and could it continue? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. The hedge ineffectiveness absolute impact in the quarter is very small. You do have a bit of a linked quarter variance because we had a negative hedge ineffectiveness result in the first quarter given what happened with rates during the first quarter. But the absolute impact that's embedded in the second quarter is actually really small Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So then something else drove down that long-term debt costs by 50 basis points? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I think if you look at long-term debt, right, part of it is we reduced our long-term debt. If you look at the absolute long-term debt costs, we reduced the rate and we reduced the amount and the rates down. Vivek Juneja : Okay, great. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of David Long with Raymond James. David Long : Hi, everyone. As it relates to the buybacks, it seems like you guys are pretty optimistic on your capital levels and the economic backdrop. Can you accelerate the pace of buybacks here in the near-term? By that, I mean, is it possible that you could buyback a higher fraction in the third quarter, meaning $5 billion or $6 billion worth of your stock? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Look, we're always looking at like the pace and we're not going to get into specifics of what we're going to do before. But when you say fast, like we haven't said how much we intend to do by core, yes. And so obviously we're going to be mindful of how with the pacing that we do it and we're going to be prudent about that. And we start with a lot of extra capital. So we feel really confident that we'll be able to get that moving at the right pace soon. David Long : Got it. Thanks for that color. And then my second question relates to the PPP forgiveness, and it's not going to be huge to the bottom line for you guys. Did you disclose what the impact was on forgiveness fees in the quarter specifically to the second quarter? Michael Santomassimo : We did not, but you did see \u2013 we did see our PPP balance has come down from roughly about $12 billion to about $8 billion, and we'll see those continue to come down and we'll continue to have some impact from as the remaining loans start to get forgiven over the next few quarters. Charles Scharf : And also keep in mind that we had said that we are giving away the fees and so very little if any net bottom line impact from that. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. So we're giving away the fees for \u2013 the gross fees for the loans that are originated in 2020. And that's mostly what's been forgiven now. David Long : Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi. Just had a very quick follow-up. And I know this is a few years out on Charlie, but I think you mentioned, over time you think the bank can achieve a 15% ROTCE. Is that \u2013 how much of that is dependent on interest rates moving higher and does that eventually need the asset cap to move higher for Wells to get to that 15% kind of ROTCE? Charles Scharf : Yes. It certainly does. Assume that the asset cap has gone and it assumes higher rates and we haven't really been specific about exactly what that means. And what we've said is, listen, we first want to get to double-digits, this is a \u2013 we're on a journey and that's kind of where we're headed. And once we get to 10%, then we can talk with some more clarity about what's next. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just in terms of clarifying your guidance on expenses. As we think about beyond 2022, is it safe to assume that incremental expense growth would be driven by revenue generation as opposed to further investment, so there maybe some room in terms of cost expense savings beyond this year? Charles Scharf : Yes. We haven't talked about our outlook on expenses past this year. I think what we've said, which I think is continuing to be true is that we've got a \u2013 we're in the middle of a multi-year efficiency program. And even with some of the investments that we need to make that we should be able to bring expenses down on a net basis for the next couple of years. So I think that still stands. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous. John McDonald : Hey, Mike. I wanted to just do another quick follow-up on the expense comments for this year. Could you just repeat what you said about the revenue-related expenses and where they're trending relative to what you baked in and kind of how that ties to the $53 billion target for this year? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Sure, John. Thanks. Embedded in our original outlook of about $53 billion, we assume that revenue-related would increase about $500 million. And at this point, we think that's probably more like $1 billion, so an incremental $500 million, and that's really largely driven by the advisory assets and business that we have in our wealth management group that's doing really well, particularly given where the market levels have been. And so that's putting pressure on the $53 billion. So it's possible if that holds that we could be a little over $53 billion, and obviously that excludes restructuring and the cost of business exit. So that's the way to think about it. John McDonald : Okay. And it also includes the expense benefit of business exits too, right, so that's not factored into that? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. The $53 billion, John, assumes that those businesses were here the full-year except for the student loan business. But for corporate trust and asset management assume they were there the full-year. Once we get to closing, which should happen later this year, we'll update how we think that's going to progress based on how we think the transition service agreements will play out. John McDonald : Okay. And then just looking at your year-to-date expense numbers, the cadence then implies that you're stepping down in the back half of the year to something that kind of averages closer to $13 billion a quarter. I'm just kind of playing out the math. Is that right way to think about it? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I think that's what the math would imply. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Charles Scharf : Thanks, John. Operator : With that I'll turn the conference back over to management. Charles Scharf : Right. Well, listen, thank you all so much for the time. We appreciate it. And if we don't talk to you during the quarter, we'll talk to you next quarter. Take care. Operator : Thank you all for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you [Indiscernible] (ph). Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Our CEO, Charles Scharf, and our CFO, Michael Santomassimo, will discuss Third Quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third-quarter earnings materials including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.  I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials.  Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thanks, John. And good morning, everyone. I will make some brief comments about our third-quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review the third-quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some third-quarter highlights. We earned $5.1 billion or $1.17 per common share in the third quarter. These results included a $1.7 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses as credit quality continued to improve. Revenue declined on lower gains from equity securities, which were elevated in the second quarter, though still strong. Expenses continue to decline, reflecting progress on our efficiency initiatives and included $250 million associated with the September OCC enforcement action. And for the first time, since the first quarter of 2020, we grew both period and loans and deposits in the third quarter. We continue to see that our customers have significant liquidity and consumers are continuing to spend, while lower than the peak in March, our consumer customers median deposit balances continued to remain above pre-pandemic levels, up 48% for customers who received federal stimulus, and 40 -- I'm sorry, up 48% for customers who receive a federal stimulus, and 40% higher for those who did not receive federal-Aid.  Weekly debit card spending during the third quarter was up every week compared to 2019. And in the week ending October 1st was up 14% compared to 2020 and 26% compared to 2019. Areas hardest hit by the pandemic have recovered, including travel up 2%, entertainment up 39%, and restaurant spending up 20% during the week ending October 1 compared with 2019. Consumer credit card spending activity continued to increase by 18% in the third quarter compared to 2019, and 24% compared to 2020. During the week ended October 1st, travel-related spending, which was the hardest hit during the pandemic, was up significantly from 2020 but remains the only category that has not yet fully rebounded to 2019 levels, still down 8% compared to 2019.  Commercial banking loans were up slightly at the end of the third quarter, while line utilization was stable at historic lows. Supply chain difficulties and labor shortages continue to represent significant challenges for our client base. And as I said earlier, overall credit performance continues to be strong. Now, let me update you on the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. First, building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure has been and remains Wells Fargo's top priority.  We reached a significant milestone with the termination of the CFPB consent order issued in September 2016 regarding improper retail sales practices. Its exploration reflects years of hard work by employees across Wells Fargo intended to ensure that the conduct at the core of the CFPB order will not recur.  As a reminder, this is the second important regulatory milestone we achieved this year with the OCC terminating a consent order related to our BSAAML compliance program in January. But the recent OCC actions are a reminder that the significant deficiencies that existed when I arrived must remain our top priority. I believe we're making meaningful progress, and I remain confident in our ability to close the remaining gaps over the next several years. Having said that, it continues to be the case that we are likely to have setbacks along the way.  We are a different bank today than we were several years ago. We run the Company with greater oversight, transparency, and operational disciplines. We have a new leadership team, 15 of 18 Operating Committee members are now new to their roles. I've spoken of our new leaders in many of our control functions but we also have many new business leaders.  This includes new leaders in consumer banking, small business banking, auto-lending, home lending, credit card, merchant services, retail services, and personal lending, digital strategy, wealth and investment management, and commercial banking. Our control infrastructure is different and we continue to invest in it.  We take a different approach to the consumer today. We created a sales practice oversight and management function and an office of consumer practices. Our approach to consumer remediation is dramatically different as we have meaningfully increased the amount paid to consumers and have accelerated payments to customers.  While we're committed to devoting the resources necessary to our risk and regulatory work. We are also focused on improving the products and services we offer. We're making investments in digital capabilities and making it easier for customers to do business with us. In the third quarter, we announced our new long-term digital infrastructure strategy that will move us to a multi-cloud environment.  This is a critical step in our multi-year journey to be digital-first and offer easier-to-use products and services. We also joined AutoFi's North American network to provide car buyers and dealers with fast and easy online sales and financing. And as I've spoken about previously, we're on track to roll out a new consumer mobile app at the beginning of next year. We've also been making significant enhancements to our payments capabilities and are seeing that momentum pull-through on our customers and Zelle usage, with Zelle users increasing 24%, transactions up 50% and volumes are up 56% from a year ago. We're executing on our work to simplify our products and build compelling offerings tailored to different customer segments.  Clear Access, our no-fee overdraft checking product now has over 1 million outstanding customer accounts. As a reminder, this launched in September 2020 and all of our retail accounts, which received ACH direct deposit have our overdraft rewind feature, which automatically reevaluates transactions from the prior business day that have incurred in overdraft. This feature has helped over 1.3 million customers avoid overdraft-related fees on 2.5 million transactions in the third quarter.  For the emerging affluent and affluent segments, we're making substantial changes to more consistently and intentionally serve these customers including products, service, marketing, and management routines. You'll hear us talk more about how we're executing on this in the coming quarters.  After successfully launching Active Cash, our new cash back credit card in July, earlier this month, we launched Reflect Card that rewards customers for making on-time payments. Our new head of the small business., Derek Ellington will start in just a couple of days, and we believe this is another attractive growth segment for us.  Next month, Paul Camp will be joining Wells Fargo as the Head of our Global Treasury Management businesses. This new role brings together our Treasury Management and Global Payment Solutions Teams into one organization. Which will enable us to be more efficient and leverage our capabilities more effectively to help clients manage their funds and process payments worldwide.  While we've been focused on improving the products and services we offer to our customers, we've continued to support our communities. We voluntarily committed to donating all gross processing fees from PPP loans funded in 2020 and created the open for the business fund to support small businesses impacted by the pandemic. We've now donated $305 million in support of small business recovery, including 215 CDFIs, which in turn is expected to help nearly 150,000 small business owners maintain more than 250,000 jobs.  Additionally, in the third quarter, we launched Connect to More resource hub for women-owned businesses and a mentoring program partnering with Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center to empower 500 women-owned businesses. We committed to invest $5 million through the Neighborhood Lift program to help more than 300 low and moderate-income residents in Philadelphia with home down payment assistance. And we published our updated ESG report and goals and performance data, which includes new disclosures on our workforce by race, gender, and job category.  As we look forward, while there certainly are risks that remain, including the latest wave of COVID infections, the recent U.S. fiscal policy stalemate, and inflation concerns, the outlook for the economy is promising. Consumer's financial condition remains strong with leverage at its lowest level in 45 years and the debt burden below its long-term average, companies are also strong as well. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past on a run-rate basis at some point next year, and will then discuss our plan to continue to increase returns. I want to thank our employees for continuing to work hard to make Wells Fargo better for our customers, shareholders, and communities. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Charlie. Good morning, everyone. Charlie summarized how we're helping our customers and communities on Slide 2. So I am going to start with our third-quarter financial results on Slide 3. Net income for the quarter was 5.1 billion or $1.17 for the common share. Our results included a $1.7 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses. This is reflective of the continuing improvement in credit performance and the economic recovery. Pretax, pre-provision profit grew from a year ago as lower revenue driven by a decline in net interest income was more than offset by lower expenses. We continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives, which have helped improve the expense run rate. And as Charlie highlighted, the third quarter included $250 million in operating losses associated with the September OCC enforcement action.  Non-interest income was relatively stable from a year ago. Within that, equity gains declined from the second quarter, but increased 220 million from a year ago, predominantly due to our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. We also had an increase in investment advisory and other asset-based fees from a year ago, as well as in card, deposit-related, and investment banking fees.  These increases were more than offset by declines in other areas, including lower mortgage banking revenue and lower markets revenue in corporate investment banking. Our effective income tax rate in the third quarter was 22.9%. Our CET1 ratio declined to 11.6% in the third quarter as we repurchased 5.3 billion of common stock.  As a reminder, our regulatory minimum will be 9.1% in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a lower GSIB capital surcharge. Additionally, under the stress capital buffer framework, we have the flexibility to increase capital distributions. And if possible, we will be able to repurchase more than the $18 billion included in our capital plan over the four-quarter period, depending on market conditions and other risks factors, including COVID related risks.  Turning to credit quality on Slide 5, our net loan charge-off ratio was 12 basis points in the quarter. Commercial credit performance continued to improve and net loan charge-offs declined $42 million from the second quarter to 3 basis points. The improvement was broad-based and included modest net recoveries in our energy portfolio and in commercial real estate. The commercial real estate portfolio has continued to perform well.  The recovery in retail and hotel properties reflected increased liquidity and improve valuations. While we have not seen any widespread stress in the office, we continue to watch this sector closely and believe that any impact as a result of a return to office or hybrid working plans will take time to play out.  Consumer credit performance also continued to improve with strong collateral values for homes and autos and consumer cash reserves remaining above pre-pandemic levels.Net loan charge-offs declined 80 million from the second quarter to 23 basis points. We continue to have net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios and losses in both credit card and auto declined. Non-performing assets declined 321 million or 4% from the second quarter, driven by lower commercial non-accruals with declines across all asset types. The energy was the largest driver, given significant improvement in fundamentals on the back of higher commodity prices. Our allowance level at the end of the third quarter reflected continued strong credit performance. The continuing economic recovery and the uncertainties still remain. If current economic trends continue, we would expect to have additional reserve releases. On Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were relatively stable from the second quarter with a decline in residential mortgage loans largely offset by modest growth in our -- in most of our consumer and commercial portfolios. Total period-end of loans grew for the first time since the first quarter of 2020 and we're up 10.5 billion from the second quarter with growth in commercial and industrial loans, auto, other consumer credit card, and commercial real estate.  Average deposits increased 51.9 billion or 4% from a year ago with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking, partially offset by continued declines in corporate and investment banking and corporate treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Turning to net interest income on Slide 7, net interest income grew 109 million or 1% from the second quarter and was down 470 million or 5% from a year ago. The decrease from a year ago was driven by lower loan balances and the impact of lower yields on earning assets, partially offset by a decline in long-term debt and lower premium amortization on our mortgage-backed securities. We had 20 billion of loans we purchased out of mortgage-backed securities or EPBOs at the end of the third quarter, down 4 billion from the second quarter.  These loans do contribute to net interest income and we expect these EPBO loan balances to decline substantially by the end of 2022. At the end of the third quarter, we also had 4.7 billion PPP loans outstanding. And we expect the balances to steadily decline over the next several quarters and to be under a billion by the end of next year. We continue to expect net interest income to be near the bottom of our initial guidance range of flat to down 4% from the annualized fourth quarter 2020 level of 36.8 billion for the full year. Turning to expenses on slide 8, non-interest expense declined 13% from a year ago. The decrease was driven by lower restructuring charges and operating losses and the progress we've made on our efficiency initiatives.  During the first 9 months of this year, these initiatives have helped to drive a 16% decline in professional and outside services expenses by reducing our spending on consultants and contractors. An 8% reduction in occupancy costs by reducing the number of locations, including branches and offices. Occupancy costs have also declined from lower COVID-19 related costs, and a 5% decline in salaries expense by eliminating management layers, and increasing expansion control across the organization, and optimizing branch staffing. Now let me provide some specific examples of the progress we're making on some of the initiatives. We are continuing to work on reducing the underlying costs to run our consumer banking business.  The pandemic accelerated customer migration to digital, which continues with mobile logons up 14% in the third quarter from a year ago. While teller transactions were flat from a year ago, they were over 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels as transactions have migrated to ATMs and mobile. Over the past year, we've reduced our number of branches by $433 or 8% and lower headcount and branch banking by 23%.  We continue to focus on generating efficiencies in our branches and have a number of initiatives designed to further reduce expenses, including reducing cash handling time and simplifying certain branch processes. Wealth and investment management has had strong increases in revenue-related compensation.  However, by executing on efficiency initiatives, non-revenue-related expenses in the third quarter declined 6% from a year ago, and nonadvisor headcount was down 10% from a year ago. We have aligned our wealth management business and our eight divisional leaders creating better coordination and efficiency. We have also implemented a more efficient client service model across all distribution channels and have reduced total square footage by rationalizing our real estate footprint.  Corporate and investment banking has continued to make progress on various efficiency initiatives. These efforts include reducing headcount, supporting products, regions, or sectors with low levels of market activity and opportunity, optimizing operations and support teams, vendor optimization, and insourcing, and reducing spending on contractors and consultants.  We're also working on initiatives and centralized functions including operations, where we have realized savings from location optimization, lower third-party spending by eliminating consulting arrangements, and consolidating vendors. The operations group has also reduced spans and layers with savings coming from eliminating manager roles. Automation efforts and strategy enhancements have driven process improvements while reducing costs in many areas, including fraud management card collections. We've also been working on additional opportunities through technology enablement that has longer lead times, but should result in benefits that we expect will reduce operations-related expenses over time. With three-quarters of actual results, already, our current outlook for 2021 expenses, excluding restructuring charges, and the cost of business exits is approximately 53.5 billion.  Note that we had 193 million of restructuring charges and cost the business exits during the first nine months of the year. This outlook includes an expectation of higher operating losses and higher revenue-related expenses than we assumed earlier in the year. Our expense outlook also assumes a full year of expenses related to Wells Fargo asset management and our corporate trust services business and we expect these sales to close during the fourth quarter. We will update you on the expense impact of these initiatives after they close.  As mentioned, the outlook accounts for the fact that we expect full-year operating losses to be approximately $250 million higher than our assumptions at the beginning of the year. This includes approximately a billion dollars of operating losses incurred during the first 9 months of the year. And our outlook assumes 250 million of operating losses in the fourth quarter. Just to remind you that operating losses can be lumpy and unpredictable, especially as we continue to address the significant work needed to satisfy our regulatory requirements.  Our current outlook also assumes revenue-related compensation will be approximately a billion dollars this year, which is higher than the 500 million we assumed at the beginning of the year. Strong equity markets have driven revenue-related expenses, which is a good thing as the associated revenue more than offsets any increase in expenses.  Now, turning to our business segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 9. Consumer small business banking revenue increased 2% from a year ago, primarily due to an increase in consumer activity, including higher debit card transactions and lower COVID -related fee waivers. The lending revenue declined 20% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in mortgage banking income driven by lower gain on sale margins, origination volumes, and servicing fees. Net interest income also declined driven by lower loan balances. These declines were partially offset by higher gains from there - securitization of loans we purchased from mortgage-backed securities last year.  Credit card revenue was up 4% from a year ago, driven by increased spending and lower customer accommodations and fee waivers in response to the pandemic. Auto revenue increased 10% from a year ago in higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on slide 10. Our mortgage originations declined 2% from the second quarter, with correspondent originations growing 2%, which was more than offset by a 5% decline in retail.  We currently expect our fourth quarter originations to decline modestly given the recent increase in mortgage rates and the typical seasonal trends in the purchase market. Despite strong consumer demand for autos, inventory shortages are putting downward pressure on industry sales and driving higher prices.  The competitive environment has remained relatively stable, and we've had our second consecutive quarter of record originations with volume up 70% from a year ago. Turning to a debit card, transactions were relatively stable from the second quarter and up 11% from a year ago with increases across nearly all categories.  We had strong growth in new credit card accounts of 63% from the second quarter, driven by the launch of our new active cash card. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 24% from a year ago and 4% from the second quarter. While payment rates remain high, average balances grew 3% from the second quarter, the first time balances have grown since the fourth quarter of 2020.  Turning to commercial banking results in Slide 11, middle-market banking revenue declined 3% from a year ago, primarily due to lower loan balances and lower interest rates, which were partially offset by higher deposit balances in deposit-related fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 12% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and lower lease income.  Non-interest expense declined 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower salaries and consulting expenses due to efficiency initiatives as well as lower lease expenses. After declining for 4 consecutive quarters, average loans stabilized in the third quarter, line utilization remain low, and loan demand continued to be impacted by low client inventory levels and strong client cash positions. However, there was some increase in demand late in the quarter and period-end balances increased 1.6 billion or 1% from the second quarter. Turning to corporate investment banking on Slide 12, in banking, total revenue increased 12% from a year ago. This growth was driven by higher advisory and equity origination fees and an increase in loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances predominantly due to actions taken to manage under the asset cap. Commercial real estate revenue grew 10% from a year ago, driven by higher commercial servicing income, loan balances and capital markets results in stronger commercial gain on sale volumes and margins and higher underwriting fees.  The market's revenue declined 15% from a year ago, driven by lower trading activity across most asset classes primarily due to market conditions. Non-interest expense declined 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by reduced operations expense due to efficiency initiatives. Wealth and investment management revenue on Slide 13 grew 10% from a year ago, a decline in net interest income due to lower, lower interest rates were more than offset by higher asset-based fees, primarily due to higher market valuations. Revenue-related compensation drove the increase in non-interest expense from a year ago. I highlighted earlier the progress we've made in efficiency initiatives to reduce non-revenue-related expenses, including salaries and occupancy expenses. Client assets increased 13% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher market valuations. Average deposits were up 4% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending.  Slide 14 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, primarily due to the sale of our student loan portfolio and lower non-interest income due to lower gains on the sale of securities in our investment portfolio. The decline in revenue from the second quarter was primarily driven by lower equity gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. And expenses included the $250 million operating loss associated with the OCC enforcement action in September. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator : At this time. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please record your name at the prompt. If at any time your question has been answered. [Operator Instructions] to withdraw your question from the question queue [Operator Instructions] Please stand by for our first question. Our first question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could address the cost outlook. I certainly appreciate the commentary regarding the fourth quarter in particular. I think as we look forward, you guys have had the expectation that costs could come down year-over-year for the next couple of years. Of course, puts you guys in a very unique position vis-a - vis many of your peers, but so many people are talking about things like wage inflation right now. Just curious, to what degree are you seeing that, and more importantly, is there enough flexibility in your existing outlook such that even despite higher wage pressures you could still see cost down year-over-year for the next couple of years? Charles Scharf : Sure. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. I guess -- let me start with the wage inflation. I think we certainly are seeing wage inflation. I would say it's very different across different parts of the Company and very different across different shot categories that we have. And so as we approach it, we're trying to be very thoughtful about ensuring that we are continuing to be as fair with people as we can be as well as paying competitively. We actually are making awards to people in our branches, which equate to roughly $2.50 an hour from the beginning of October through the end of the year.  To thank them for what they're doing, but also address the competitiveness that exists out there and we're evaluating what makes sense for the longer-term. And in places of the Company where we do see wage pressure, we're acting accordingly, but I would not say that it's something that we see everywhere across the entire Company and every single job. But we're certainly prepared for it and look at it very, very regularly as we look at things like attrition and whatnot. To the broader question, I think, first of all, we're in the middle of doing our budgets now as I'm sure you hear from everyone when they do these calls at this time of year. Our goal is still the same that we've said in the past, which is we still would like to see net reductions in the overall expense base. We are in a unique position in that, I would say in two ways. First of all, we do have the significant amount that we're spending on regulatory orders and we're not assuming that we get efficiencies out of that in the near future. But one day when we built all that's required, that will be an opportunity for us, but that's not even on the radar screen for us right now. But we still have just tremendous excess expenses across the Company. You can see it in headcount.  You can see it inefficiency ratios across the businesses. And what I found here is the same thing I think that Mike and I've seen that a lot of other places, which is it's like peeling an onion back. You think you see what's incredibly clear. Once you actually get rid of those inefficiencies, you then start to see the next level and it becomes part of the culture. And we engage the entire Company is moving that way. So we still think that there extremely meaningful efficiencies that we can pursue for quite some time here which hopefully will both allow us to have net reductions, but also invest appropriately, whether it's in technology or products which, as we've said we're extremely focused on as well. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Thank you very much. And then, I was hoping, Mike, you might be able to expand on comment you made about loan growth, or excuse me, loan demand improving later in the quarter. There seems to be a little bit of a divergence emerging between the demand we're seeing it in say smaller and middle-market companies, for instance, versus what we're seeing with larger corporates that might have better access to the capital markets. Curious if you could just provide a little more color on where you're seeing that improved demand, please. Michael Santomassimo : Yeah. And I assume we will see some divergence across different -- some of the peers as you look at this. But if you look at the Commercial Bank as an example, we're actually seeing the demand in the pipeline build in the middle and upper end of the client-base, with a little bit less of demand emerging so far on the lower end, which I know is contrary to what you -- the way you asked the question. But I think that's what we're seeing right now. And I think in part that's because the clients in the lower end of our client base still have a lot of excess liquidity and they're still dealing with supply chain crunches and other issues that are sort of impacting their need for liquidity and their need for credit.  And so I think that'll -- we'll start to see more demand I think more consistently across the client base over time as things play out, that's what we're seeing in the commercial bank. I think when you look more broadly and you look at the consumer side, we have seen balances grow on auto, we've seen them in card. When you look through the home lending data that we give you, we are seeing growth on our kind of core, non-conforming mortgage book as well. That's offset by the declines in loans that we bought out from securities last year.  But we are seeing some growth there, too. And then, you see some growth in the commercial -- in the corporate investment bank. And that's really a little bit of a lot of things happening across the corporate Investment Bank, whether it's real estate, subscription, finance, and other sectors that are really driving some of that growth. And so again, it's still relatively modest so far in terms of what we've seen, and I think it will take some more time for it to really play out in a more meaningful way. But it's encouraging to start to see at least a little bit manifest so far. And I would just encourage you to make sure that you look at the period end balances as well as the averages because it gets -- it certainly gets to the heart of the question. And then just one final thing I'll say on these switches, we're not stretching in any way in terms of credit or pricing or things like that to try and get to a result. We're continuing to the same disciplines that we've always had. And it's going to be a question of no balances are rising because of greater customer activity. Scott Siefers : That's terrific. Thank you, guys very much. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open. Kenneth Usdin : Hey, guys. Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering, Mike, if you could just talk a little bit about just some of the ins and outs on underneath NII outside from balance sheet movements, meaning you saw a little bit of increase in premium, and can you just remind us like how that mechanism works in terms of what rates we need to do to have ongoing improvement there. And are you at the point -- how closer to the point where your incremental purchases or replacements on the securities book are getting closer to what's rolling off? Thanks. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Thanks, Ken. I think when you think about premium amortization, I think you said it backward, but like we're getting a benefit from premium amortization coming down in the quarter. And you saw that in our results is roughly $90 million a little bit, maybe a couple of bucks less, but and so we expect as we've been saying, we expect that to continue to come down. I think it will be somewhat gradual as we look at the next couple of quarters. You're not going to see big step-downs. I think it'll come down again in the fourth quarter, maybe a little less than we saw from the second to the third quarter. As rates, as you've seen over the last three months, rates have been a little all over the place. It's a bit of a function of where mortgage rates are and there's a little lag to it as it comes through the data. But we still expect the general trajectory to be coming down on premium amortization. It's just a matter of exactly how fast and over what time period that'll happen. I think on the second part of the question, what was the second part again, Ken, the -- Kenneth Usdin : Just about reinvestment rates versus the underlying portfolio and the securities book. Michael Santomassimo : Yeah. No. And again, I -- even on that, I keep reminding people as you look at the third quarter, rates were much, much lower than they are today for most of the second quarter. And so, really, we've seen them rally at the tail end of the quarter and stabilize to come down slightly since then over the last week or so. That gap is closing, obviously, in terms of what's rolling off and getting closer to the overall average in the portfolio, but we still have a little way to go for rate to -- for reinvestment rates to match what's rolling out of the portfolio. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Got it. And just last quick one. Just long-term debt you've been meaningfully reducing the footprint and helped by that mix, improving on the balance sheet is. How much more of an opportunity is that to continue to lower the long-term debt footprint and reduce the cost of it? Thanks, Mike. Michael Santomassimo : Yeah. No. It's a good question and I think our constraints going to be TLAC, you know, how much TLAC we have to hold. And I think you can probably model that out a little bit. So we have a little bit more room to go to continue to optimize the mix here and bring the long-term debt down. But it's likely at some point -- it's likely at some point next year, that'll start to change. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good afternoon. I'd ask a follow-up on Ken's last line of questioning around the NII outlook. And if I take all the different component pieces that you mentioned, it is stored in the blender. So more constructive loan growth commentary, some modest but steady premium, and benefit, but still some reinvestment headwinds. Is it reasonable to expect that you can grow NII versus the lower end of the guidance range for '21 and separately, what's your appetite to deploy excess liquidity just given your excess reserves parked at the Fed, at least as a percentage of the overall balance sheet, is still quite elevated relative to many of your peers. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Maybe I'll start with the second one and I'll come back to the first part, Steven. As we think about redeployment, we're still being pretty patient. And as I just mentioned to Ken's question, you look at what's been happening over the last few months. Rates were much lower, they rallied recently. At the same time, the basis between treasuries and mortgages is actually compressed a bit so made them a little bit relatively more expensive. And so I think -- so we're -- and if you look at what's happening in inflation and with tapering coming and we still think that there's more risk to upside on rates than there is downside at this point.  And so we're still being patient as we sort of look at our redeployment there. And when opportunities present themselves, we'll take advantage of them and we did that a little bit right at the end of the third quarter where we accelerated some purchases that we were making given the spike in the rally that we saw there.  And so we'll continue to do that, but we're going to be patient as we see how things develop over the coming months. If you try to think about the range for the full year, we've been giving a range for a reason because there's a lot of moving pieces and there's still a few months to play out. And I think if we obviously see a faster loan growth than we expect, that'll be a positive. If we see rates move a little bit higher than what the forward curve has, that'll be positive. We still have to, just to keep up with where the securities portfolio we have a lot of purchases to make in the fourth quarter.  And so where rates end up throughout will be important. And then on the margin, there's things like PPP and other factors that sort of drive that and that will be determined based on the client forgiveness trends that we see in our client base. So I think there are scenarios where we could be a little bit better than what we projected there, and there's some scenarios where we could be a little bit worse depending on how all those factors play out. Steven Chubak : And that's great color. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hi, I wanted to follow up on the expenses. When we think about the aspiration for expenses to be down next year and understanding that you've gone through budgeting and that's a goal right now, Mike is that -- can we think of it Is that your goal relative to the 53.5 and wouldn't include help from the business exits. Michael Santomassimo : Yeah, John. We think about the business exits just separate from the core efficiency we're driving. And for lack of a better way to describe it, if we think that there's going to be a savings of X dollars as these businesses roll off, take the 53.5% and subtract the X and that'll be the new -- our new goal in your starting place. When we gave you a high level, some detail about that in April, and when these close and we've got good clarity on it, we'll be very transparent about how to reset the baseline and starting point. John McDonald : Sure. And in terms of you expecting gains on sales, I assume those are -- you thinking the same lines, and those should probably come in the fourth quarter is what you're currently thinking? Michael Santomassimo : They may not all be in the fourth quarter given how the deals were structured, not 100% of the gains will be in the fourth quarter, but a good chunk of it will be in the fourth quarter. And obviously, we'll be clear on what that was when it happens. John McDonald : Okay. And the last thing for me is if we want to dream about loan growth coming back for the industry, how do we think about how much capacity you have to grow loans while staying under the asset cap and where does that come from? Does it come from cash liquidity mix and moving other stuff around the balance sheet. Can you just give us some thoughts on that? Michael Santomassimo : We all dream of faster loan growth. I think we're aligned there like. I think we've got plenty of room to grow on the loan side and whether it comes initially from cash that's sitting at the FED or -- that would be the first place. But if we needed to, we could reduce the securities portfolio as well if it grew much faster than what we expected, that would be a nice problem to have. But at this point, we have plenty of capacity to grow. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess just one big picture question, Charlie. Appreciate you mentioning the risk of setbacks as you go through the whole regulatory process. At the same time, when we talk to investors, I think there is a [Indiscernible] the longer you stay within that asset cap. I was wondering if you could address just in terms of when we think about the franchise, both from a talent and client standpoint, how what it should your shareholders be about that? Or do you think that's well taken care of? Charles Scharf : Well, I think it's well -- I would say I do think it's well taken care of? I'll start there, but I think we think about it. We think about it every day that we take actions to stay below the cap. I think as Mike just spoke about, we have significant room on the asset side of the balance sheet, which is we really want to be there for clients where they need you. And so when you're out hustling for business, we're certainly able to fulfill their needs on it doesn't matter whether it's consumer or whether it's a corporate. Our experience has been that we continue to find ways to optimize the balance sheet in a way that has very little client impact. And where we have to move deposits off the balance sheet, we work with customers to come up with other off-balance sheet solutions for them.  And I think my experience has been that customers are very, very understanding of what that is. Again as we think about -- and by the way, we have not limited the growth of deposits on the consumer side at all. When we think about the more long-term impacts, I think we certainly would have liked to have been in a different position if we had a choice, but we're trying to be very smart about having as little franchise impact as possible when we make these decisions and make sure we're communicating with customers. I think the people here at Wells have done an amazing job of striking that right balance. And as I said, I think we're as open for businesses anyone on the asset side. I think customers appreciate that as well. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thanks for shedding that perspective. And just one quick one, Mike, on the NII. When we look at the fourth quarter, you on your full-year guidance, should -- does the net of all of that implied that fourth-quarter NII should at least grow from third-quarter levels? And can you disclose what the PPP impact was for the third quarter NII number? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I think on the fourth quarter, you can model based on what your assumptions are. And as I've said, will be near the bottom of the range and you can pick where you think we will be based on how you feel about it. I think for third quarter, the PPP impact was about a 115 million. And just to give you a little context, that was a little bit lower than what we saw in the second quarter and we would expect the fourth quarter to be a little bit lower than that potentially, but that will be -- all be based on how clients -- the pace of forgiveness request that we get from clients. But overall, a pretty small sequential impact. And that's always our forecast. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. On the expense side, how should we think about the timing and the magnitude of the remaining 4.3 billion in cost saves? And would you say that any of the latest regulatory developments impacted how you're thinking about the magnitude or the timing of the realization of those saves? Thanks. Michael Santomassimo : Yeah, John, it's Mike. as we said in beginning of the year, we were going to get about 3.7 billion of the 8 billion this year and the annualized impact starts to build as you go through the year. So some of that you get in the run rate coming out of 2021. And some of that will take more time to get at. And as I mentioned, where we have to introduce new technology or other new capabilities, it just takes longer to get at some of it. And as we said in the beginning of the year, this is a multi-year plan, so we're not going to get all of that in the first 12 months by any stretch. And as we get to January, we'll give you a better view of what to expect in 2022. John Pancari : Okay. Got it. And then separately on the loan front, can you just maybe give us more detail on trends you're seeing in the card business, including spending volume as well as payment rates. And then separately, any thoughts on the impact of the buy now, pay later product on how you're thinking about your product set. Thanks. Michael Santomassimo : Yeah, I think when you look at payment rates, they're still really high. They bounce around a little bit month-to-month in the last quarter. So -- but they're still really high. And so, what you are getting -- When you look at the balance growth you're seeing, you're really getting that through an increase in the point-of-sale purchase volumes that are coming through. Charlie highlighted a bunch of stats based on what we're seeing in the book, but I'd say, overall, spend patterns, spend is pretty -- still pretty strong, pretty stable from where we saw in the second quarter up versus the comparable periods last year or in 2019.  And as you'd expect, in any given week or month, or quarter, the different categories move around quite a bit depending on what's happening based on that time period. And then I think when you look at, as you can see, that point-of-sale volumes dropped 24% from the quarter a year ago, 4% sequentially. And you can see the new account growth which is up quite a bit under 50% from a year ago and 63% from the second quarter, based on the new products we've launched. So I'd characterize it as still really strong activity levels despite the noise you see out there related to the Delta variant and other things. Charles Scharf : And on the -- this is Charlie. On buying out pay later, I would say, I would describe buy now, pay later as another option of providing credit and serving the merchant. I think as others have said, it's still overall a relatively small portion of the market. But I think it'll be a place for it, but it's not going to supplant all the other types of credit that exist out there. We have our own retail services business; we have our own personal lending business. And we've got a significant number of merchant relationships ourselves. It's a place that we will be in addition to the products that we have. And over time, my guess is it will continue. It will, seeing a proliferation of people involved now, at some time, at some point will become far more consolidated for all the reasons that these other industries have been consolidated, including those that can really provide a differentiated experience for the merchant. So hopefully that helps. John Pancari : Thanks, Charlie. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Hey guys. Charlie, I wanted to follow up again on the comment about likely to have additional setbacks and the regulatory stuff. And just to push here for a little bit, if you don't mind, is this kind of like a broad risks statement just in case, like \"you never know, \" or should we just be prepared for something more meaningful whether it's a speed bomb or potential landmine between here and specifically the end of the asset cap, which I think everyone views key turning point? Charles Scharf : You know, I guess -- I would describe it this way. Everyone focuses on the asset cap, and I understand all the reasons for that, for sure. And I think just what's important to us is that we want to make sure that there's complete transparency, which we believe we have if you read our 10-Q. But also, we want to make sure that you're just thinking about the broad set of things that we're dealing with. And the reality is the asset cap embedded in the FED consent order is one very important order. But we still have other consent orders with other agencies which are still extraordinarily important. We have other inquiries that are in progress that are described in there.  I just think it's important that we're completely transparent. It's nothing different than what we've been saying. And when you talk about [Indiscernible] versus land mines, hopefully, we all work to make sure that we minimize the likelihood of a land mine. But as I said before, there's the interconnectedness, just the pure number of things that we have to do are complex. We're judged on practices that were in place years ago, as well as practices that are in place today. And we're judged based upon the overall progress, based upon the initial due dates of some of these things. So nothing changes my perspective about net now that we're moving forward. I absolutely believe we are. Again, we have -- we're able to see all the internal metrics every interim date, and things like that, which the outsiders can't see. But we choose our words very carefully on things like that, so I just want to make sure that people understand that we have these things that are out there and don't want you to be surprised if something happens, but it doesn't change our point of view of what the opportunity is and how confident we are about being able to close these things. Matthew O\u2019Connor: And as a follow-up, I know you can't tell us what the conversation content is with the regulators. But can you at least tell us, do you have what the point of conversation like on the asset cap, we submitted the plan, you accepted that. Like how long does this going to take? Like, is there -- we all just on the outside of trying to understand like what the level of communication is because I think on some fronts, there's a large communication, like the OCC, I think, sits in all the banks and offices, so there's a lot of regular communication there. But with the FED and the asset cap is like -- is there any conversation about it even if you can't tell us? Charles Scharf : A couple of things. First of all, we have and I think this is not just us, I think this is true of all banks. We have regular conversations with all of our regulators. Absolutely, with the OCC, as you say there, many examiners in our offices on a regular basis. But we have an extremely open and interactive relationship with the CFPB, with the FED, with the FDIC, and all other appropriate regulators, including the SEC, FINRA, overseas regulators. That is the way we treat the relationships. I have found the FED to be clear, consistent in their approach to issues that relate to supervision. I think this is just a general comment that I would say. I haven't seen things deviate from that. And as I've said, when you look at the consent order, it doesn't say submit a plan. And then we'll talk about lifting the asset cap. It describes in there, what we have to do. And so, you just assume that there is -- we have a constant level of engagement that we're really clear on what we have to do. And we're doing the work to get there. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. That's helpful color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Mike, can you share with us your credit quality is very strong similar to many in the industry. Your net charge-off ratio, of course, was an incredibly low 12 basis points. Do you have an idea of how long you could sustain such a strong level of net charge-offs. and when you may want -- when it may reach a more normalized level of sometimes looking out. And then second, your reserves relative to loans, I think we're about a 170 basis points and when we go back to that day, one [Indiscernible] number that you guys put out in January of 2020, it was about 93 basis points and that difference, [Indiscernible] at the widest of all your peers. So any thoughts on just where the reserve could go as well? Thank you. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Gerard. A couple of things. I think so far, we've all, I think, in the industry have been wrong about when credit or how credit will normalize. And at some point, I think we all expect that we're going to get back to more normal charge-off rates. Having said that, the new normal might be different if people, keep higher sustained higher liquidity balances throughout time. So I think that's something that still play out. I think at this point, as Charlie highlighted in his script that we still -- people still have high liquidity balances. We're seeing high payout chart, pay-off rates in credit cards and other loans. And so, there's no reason to think that we shouldn't continue to have strong credit performance in the near term.  12 bases may -- they may not be 12 basis points, but it should still be historically quite strong, at least in the near term. And we will see how it starts to normalize. I think as it really -- Let me add one thing on that. I just think when we think about long-term earnings power of the Company and we talk about our ability to get to sustainable return numbers, we assume that the charge-off number will go up from there. So we agree it's extremely low, that it won't stay here. And as you think about when we think about our returns, we make adjustments for that.  And so, if they do start to rise next year, then it will be hopefully in our assumptions, and if not, then we'll get there sooner maybe, but we'll explain why. And as it relates to the coverage ratio today, as we've said for the last couple of quarters, we continue to be reserved for whole number of different scenarios and hopefully will prove out to be very conservative relative to what plays out over the coming quarters. And if we continue to see trends continue, we'll have more releases as we go.  I think whether you get back to a day one, seasonal levels or not, I think is a really almost impossible question to answer, given it's going to be a function of all the variables you now have to consider, and what your outlook is, what the different risks are at that time. And if you go back to first quarter of 2020, I think we had with 3.5% unemployment at that point, and it was a very [Indiscernible], I think pre - COVID it was a very Utopian environment I think from an economic perspective. And so will we get it back to exactly that outlook, hard to say. But I think we continue to think if things play out, we'll have more releases and that number will go down. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, can you give us an update in the middle market investment banking initiatives? How successfully you guys been in penetrating your existing customer base? Michael Santomassimo : Yeah, I know -- we've highlighted, Gerard, we think that's a really big opportunity over a long period of time, but it doesn't happen in a quarter or two. It takes some time to really make sure that we've got those relationships built out in the way we want. We really started to put some extra focus on it in a very disciplined way late last year, so I'd say we're still early. I think we're seeing some encouraging green shoots where we've had some opportunities that we've won over the last few months or a couple of quarters that we might not have been in a position to have before that, but it'll take some time to play out, but we do think the opportunity is pretty big. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, how are you doing? Charles Scharf : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Two questions. One on branch network, just wanted to get your updated thoughts on how you see your footprint today, and is there more of an opportunity to expand or to optimize? Charles Scharf : That's a good question, Betsy. I think we're actually doing a bunch of work on exactly what that looks like because we have been very, very focused on net reductions given the fact that we were behind some others. And so the team has done a great work and just terms of identifying, what I will describe as just we had a significant number of very obvious consolidation opportunities they're really not closures, which typically they're really consolidation where we have the appropriate local coverage.  I think the work that we're doing is we -- is to really think through, at this point, where we have significant share, where we have less share, but we have enough concentration. What our footprint looks like in some of those places to figure out how we can actually reorient the existing number of branches that we have over a period of time. So I think the reality is we will continue to optimize because as time goes on, we will continue too needless. We're focused on not leaving communities that need our help without solutions. We're going to certainly wind up with smaller footprints in a lot of the places because branch usage is changing. But we will use that as an opportunity to figure out how to redeploy some of those resources as well. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Now, I have a same question on your wealth platform. I know you recently brought in Barry to run that and just want to understand the strategy there if you don't mind. Charles Scharf : Sure. I think we've got [Indiscernible] falls into four distinct buckets. Number one, is we have our -- think of it as our independent broker channel where it's the old [Indiscernible] words and businesses like that, [Indiscernible] that came together to form that network. We have then financial advisors that work extremely closely with our bank branches and believe that's still a relatively untapped opportunity for us. We also have a platform where brokers can actually go -- and when I say independent those are wrong phrase, in the beginning, those are people who are employees, but we have a platform where people can actually go independent and continue to do the business through us. And then, we have our online business, WellsTrade. And so we've got those distinct different points of distribution. And we're focused equally on maximizing the value that existed in all of those. Historically, I think we ran it much more as just one big opportunity. And I think we feel like we have underinvested in the online piece and the independent piece for sure. And the bank branch piece is something which we think is just, as I said, just a very meaningful opportunity given the amount of [Indiscernible] customers that we have in our branch footprint. Betsy Graseck : Thanks. Michael Santomassimo : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Thank you. Once again, if you would like to ask a question, [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi Charlie. Going to go back to the regulatory consent orders. Want to get a sense from you. Given the setback we had this quarter with the additional consent order, you've obviously spent a lot on these, you\u2019ve hired -- you brought in a lot of folks already since you've been there over the last two years and a lot of consultants, a lot of in-house people. So what do you need to do differently, especially as a management team, to not have more of those setbacks and to have it go in the direction you were hoping it would go with this? Charles Scharf : Yes. I would say there's nothing new that we have to do as far as reaching an endpoint. So if you said pre-consent order or post-consent order, does it change what we have to do to build out the right capabilities with the right controls, in this case, in mortgage? The answer is absolutely not. And so again, whether or not it's being done fast enough, in the regulators minds relative to how long some of these things have been going on, which predate many of us. That's the context which they need to look at this end.  Because that's who they regulate and how they have regulated. So again, I think for us, and I'm not minimizing a consent order. Consent order is a very big deal. But the work that's embedded in there, the end-state, is the same end-state that we would have contemplated. Building ourselves. And so there's a lot more formality that's part of the process now, in the OCC will be more deeply involved in the series of the checkpoints, and things like that. And there certainly is some more work that comes out of an exercise like that. But the end-state is the same. Vivek Juneja : And so when you say, several years, Charlie, and should we think that in terms of as in three-year timeframe, is that five-year timeframe just -- you're right, we've all been dealing with this before you got there, so there's already been 5 plus years, so any sense of direction there? Charles Scharf : I think this -- and I don't want to -- in the perfect world, we'd lay out all of our plans for everyone, but we're obviously not in a position to do that. And I think what I would just encourage you to do is look at the things that we've closed. Hopefully, you'll continue to see progress as we look forward and you'll be able to draw judgments based upon that. And relative to what it means for our business. As I said, we still have a fair amount of flexibility in order for us to grow fee-based businesses and grow businesses that require balance sheet usage on the asset side. I can't give you any more specificity other than we don't want to mislead people. And it's not as if we're not thinking about the future. And so again, we try and be very careful not to weigh too much on one side or the other. But we've got a lot of people here that serve customers every day and every single person isn't working on a consent order. Many are, we got a huge number of resources that are dedicated to it. But as you see, we're building products in the card business. We are building products in our retail services business. We're doing the same across the digital platforms across the Company. And as we execute on these items, you build the confidence of the regulators.  So it's not as if you have to wait until everything is completely done to be able to continue to move forward, not just with your confidence, but with their confidence in as well. And so, hopefully, in terms of the progress that we believe we're making, that's what we're seeing. And so, you'll see us put all the resources towards these things to minimize the timeframe, but get them done properly at the same time that we're moving the business forward.

Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our 2021 results, the operating environment, and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results and some of our expectations for 2022 before we take your questions. Let me start with some 2021 highlights. We earned $21.5 billion or $4.95 per common share in 2021. Expenses declined 7% from a year ago, reflecting lower operating losses and progress on our efficiency initiatives. Revenue increased 6% as we benefited from strong gains from equity securities and gain from sales of our student lending, asset management, and corporate trust businesses. We also have broad-based revenue growth across our businesses, including home lending, consumer and small business banking, credit card, auto, commercial real estate, banking and wealth and investment management. Credit quality improved significantly as the economy improved and our customers had high levels of liquidity. Our loan charge-off ratio declined from 35 basis points in 2020 to 18 basis points in 2021, and our allowance for credit losses declined by $5.7 billion. Deposits increased $78 billion or 6%, and loans grew 1% with declines in the first half of the year offset by a 5% increase in the second half. We also returned significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share in the third quarter, and we repurchased $14.5 billion of common stock, predominantly in the second half of the year after the return to the SCB framework. Our results in the fourth quarter also showed continued broad-based momentum. We earned $5.8 billion or $1.38 per common share. We grew loans by $32.6 billion or 4% and deposits by $12.1 billion or 1% from the third quarter. Expenses declined 1% from the third quarter and 11% from a year ago, and we generated positive operating leverage over both periods. Most importantly, we continued to prioritize our risk and control work, and the strong economy continues to positively impact our customers and our results. Consumers continued to have more liquidity than prior to the pandemic, though we do see this decline as the median balances today are 27% higher than pre-pandemic levels but are down 10% from the third quarter. Consumer credit card spend also continued to be strong, up 28% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 27% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Holiday sales were strong with spending up 31% the three weeks leading up to Thanksgiving and that momentum continued post Thanksgiving. All spending categories were up in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, with the largest increases in travel, fuel, entertainment, and dining. Weekly debit card spend during the fourth quarter was up every week compared to both 2019 and 2020. This increase was driven by higher transactions but also higher spend per transaction, reflecting inflationary impacts and increased spending in higher cost categories such as travel. We are watching the impact from Omicron on consumer spending. And while there is some softening in restaurant, travel, and entertainment in recent weeks, overall spending remained strong in the first week of January with credit card up 26% and debit card up 29% versus the same week in 2020. And we saw strong loan growth from the third quarter across our commercial businesses, including commercial real estate, asset-based lending, middle market banking, and our markets and banking businesses. So, I've been at the Company for a little over two years now, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes giving you my thoughts on our progress. Overall, I feel great about what we've accomplished and continue to feel energized about the opportunities in front of us. I think about this along several dimensions : talent, leadership and culture, risk regulatory and control, financial and strategic progress, and our work on ESG and broader reputational issues. I've spoken of the substantial talent changes we've made, but just to remind you 11 of 18 members are new to the operating committee and two are new to their job since I arrived. Additionally, well over half of the senior-most people at our company, meaning those who are one level below the operating committee are new to their roles and a significant proportion of them were hired from outside the Company. This is a dramatic change in our leadership. And with it, we've changed how we run the Company, how we prioritize our work, and how we view our responsibility broadly. We began a process two years ago to change the culture and priorities of the Company. And the most significant part of this prioritization was the building and implementation of an effective risk and control framework across the Company. Our approach and our progress are entirely different than they were when I arrived. We are laser-focused on meeting our own expectations and those of our regulators. We have clear plans in place and clear owners for every regulatory deliverable we have. We have detailed reporting on how we're progressing on those plans. We review this reporting every single week at the operating committee level. The detailed involvement of the operating committee members is very different from what was happening before I arrived. Our ability to identify issues has also improved from two years ago. I continue to believe that we're making significant progress, and this is based on what we see in our internal reporting. It doesn't mean that we're perfect. The fact that we have multiple consent orders makes it complex. It takes time to build all of our capabilities. And it's certainly in the regulator's purview to look at issues that have been outstanding for a long time, like the OCC did in the third quarter. But I would point you to the comment made by the OCC in their recent consent order that highlights that we have taken steps to comply with their 2018 order, and we're committed to addressing remaining requirements. I remain confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years. Having said that, it continues to be the case that we're likely to have setbacks along the way, but that doesn't change the fact that we believe that the quality of the talent we now have and the processes we now have in place will enable us to get the work done. We're making progress increasing the earnings power of the Company and have also begun to invest in a more holistic and aggressive way to drive stronger organic growth in all of our businesses. We're just now beginning to bring things to market that are differentiated and the number of significant opportunities are exciting. We're continuing to track to the financial return goals we' ve discussed : first, achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past and then target 15%. We continue to believe that we will achieve the 10% during one of the quarters in 2022 on an annualized basis. To achieve this, we're aggressively focused on driving efficiencies and we're seeing net expense reductions after significant investments in our control build-out and our businesses. We are aggressively returning excess capital to shareholders now that we've returned to the SCB framework. We continue to manage credit well, and we're seeing early benefits from higher interest rates, growing loan balances and higher fees in certain businesses. We're doing this while devoting significant resources to building our franchise. We have fallen behind in providing competitive digital capabilities for our clients. This is changing. In the fourth quarter, we announced a rebuilt mobile banking experience for consumer and small business customers that is set to beginning -- set to begin rolling out this quarter. It has a new modern look and feel and a simpler user experience that will help our customers more easily accomplish their banking needs. This platform is necessary to drive significantly higher digital adoption from our customers. Even with our existing capabilities, in the fourth quarter, our customers logged in 1.6 billion times using a mobile device, up 7% year-over-year. Teller transactions remained more than 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels. We also announced that later this year, we'll be adding an all-new virtual assistant, Fargo to the app. Customers will be able to get answers to their everyday banking questions, ask Fargo to complete the task for them, and Fargo will also provide personalized insights and recommendations to help customers better manage their finances. We will also be introducing the first phase of the redesign of our public website early this year. In addition, we're beginning to become more active on the wholesale side. For example, we announced that we're collaborating with HSBC to optimize the settlement of foreign exchange transactions through a blockchain-based solution, which will reduce settlement risks and associated costs. We're also approaching payments and credit cards very differently. We believe credit cards will remain important as both the credit and as a payment vehicle. We were also doing additional work around non-card payments and believe we must succeed here to be a key financial services provider. Two years ago, our products and capabilities supporting those products were not as competitive as necessary. In 2021, we launched two products including, Active Cash, which we believe is the best cash-backed product in the marketplace, and Reflect, which rewards customers for on-time payments. We improved the core experience, including investing in advertising, simplifying our digital application and enhancing our underwriting. These efforts have driven an increase in digital card activation, paperless statements and enrollment alerts. We are opening approximately twice as many accounts as we were prelaunch of these products, and importantly, we're not competing on credit. In fact, the quality of applications and the accounts for booking continues to be better than what we were booking historically. Away from card, we're beginning to invest in our broader digital payments across the platform, enhancing our capabilities, increasing limits and broadly reducing the friction and moving money. As evidence, Zelle momentum continued to accelerate with Zelle transactions up 46% from a year ago. We are also taking a very different approach in that we believe that for us to be successful. We must consider a broader set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. This is not in lieu of shareholders. In fact, we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. We have taken significant efforts to support small businesses since the beginning of the pandemic and recently fulfilled our roughly $420 million Open for Business fund commitment to assist small businesses in recovering from the pandemic, by working with not-for-profits to offer capital, technical assistance and long-term programs. The fund was created by donating the gross processing fees we made from administering the Paycheck Protection Program loans in 2020. Additionally, we made significant climate commitments in 2021. In the fourth quarter, we joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance, an industry-led leadership group designed to foster collaboration and support banks in aligning their financing with the goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time. And last year, we announced our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions attributable to financing by 2050. We expect to announce our first finance emission targets for the oil and gas and power sectors later this year. We made our first solar-plus-battery-storage tax equity commitment. Once it is operational, it will be one of the largest solar and battery projects in the Company. Last year, we surpassed $13.3 billion in cumulative tax equity investments in nearly 600 wind, solar and fuel cell transactions. These investments have provided 13% of all utility scale wind and solar capacity in the U.S. over the past 16 years. We continue to be one of the top investors in affordable multifamily housing in the U.S. as well as an active lender for affordable rental housing developments. Additionally, we're committed to expanding affordable homeownership. For example, in the fourth quarter, we committed to invest $5 million through the NeighborhoodLIFT program to help more than 300 low and moderate income residents in Houston with home payment down assistance -- I'm sorry, home down payment assistance. We've also supported our employees and in December, we announced that as part of our commitment to providing comprehensive benefits and competitive pay, we're increasing U.S. minimum pay hourly pay levels to a range of $18 to $22 effective at the end of this month. Just this week, we announced new efforts that will roll out over the course of 2022 to help our consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and cover short-term cash needs, building on other changes we've made over the last several years. The changes we announced include the elimination of transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection, the elimination of nonsufficient fund fees, early access to direct deposit by providing customer access to funds up to two days before their scheduled deposit, a 24-hour grace period for customers that overdraw their account to cover the balance before incurring an overdraft fee, and a new short-term credit product for customers to meet personal financial needs. This builds on existing features we already have in place, including Clear Access Banking, our no-overdraft checking account that we launched in September 2020, and we now have over 1.1 million outstanding customer accounts. Overdraft Rewind, which was introduced in 2017, which automatically rewinds overdraft fees when a covering direct deposit is received by the next morning, which were replaced by our expanded 24-hour grace period. Balance alerts that help customers avoid overdraft by sending more than 1.3 million alerts every day. Putting all of these changes in perspective, these fees are down significantly since the financial crisis. We have alternatives for both customers that do not want to overdraft and those that do. This is a competitive marketplace. We continue to review our capabilities and pricing with the goal of providing value to our customer. And let me make a few comments now as we look forward. While there is a risk with the continued growth of the Omicron variant or potentially other variants later this year, I expect to see continued strong economic trends in 2022. Consumers' financial condition remains strong. Modest debt growth, strong asset appreciation and higher deposit balances have left household balance sheets in excellent condition, which should help drive continued strong consumer spending. Corporate America has demonstrated the ability to adapt to the ever-changing pandemic conditions. Inventories remained unusually lean as businesses adopted a defensive posture and supply chains have been disrupted. This is expected to result in substantial gains in industrial production as they continue to restock. We're beginning to see loan growth and expect this to continue. In a moment, Mike will provide our thoughts on net interest income and expenses for 2022. I commented earlier that we remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past, on a run rate basis at some point this year. And that once we've achieved this goal, we'll discuss our plan to continue to increase returns. But at a high level, we continue to believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors including a modest increase in interest rates or further steepening of the curve; ongoing progress on incremental efficiency initiatives; a small impact from returns on growth-related investments in our businesses; continued execution on our risk and regulatory control framework; and moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted. It's important to note we currently have the ability to grow loans even under the asset cap. The changes we made to the Company and continued strong economic growth prospects make us feel good about how we're positioned entering 2022. We also remain cognizant that we still have a multiyear effort to satisfy our regulatory requirements with setbacks likely to continue along the way. And we continue our work to put exposures related to our historical practices behind us. As we look forward, we will continue to be aggressive in driving progress and improvement in our performance, embrace our responsibility to our customers and communities, and I remain incredibly optimistic about our future. I want to conclude by thanking our employees who continue to serve our customers through another challenging year. I appreciate their hard work and their resiliency while we made progress on making Wells Fargo better. I look forward to all that we accomplish in the year ahead. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Great. Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everybody. Charlie summarized how we helped our customers, communities and employees last year on Slides 2 and 3, so I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.38 per share -- common share. Our fourth quarter results included a $943 million net gain on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. There could be future gains related to these sales due to post-closing adjustments and earn-out provisions; an $875 million decrease in allowance for credit losses as credit trends continue to be strong; and a $260 million impairment of certain leased railcars due to changes in demand for these cars. We also had $2.5 billion or $1.9 billion after non-controlling interest of equity gains, primarily from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, the third consecutive quarter of strong returns in these businesses. Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately 23%, including the discrete impacts related to business divestitures. Our CET1 ratio declined to 11.4% in the fourth quarter, reflecting share repurchases and an increase in risk-weighted assets primarily from loan growth in the quarter. We repurchased $7 billion of common stock in the fourth quarter, partially offset by $1.4 billion of new issuances, predominantly for the annual matching contribution for our 401(k) plans. As a reminder, the regulatory minimum for our CET1 ratio will be 9.1% in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a lower G-SIB capital surcharge. Turning to Credit Quality on Slide 6. Our net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points in the fourth quarter. Commercial credit performance continued to be strong with net loan charge-offs declining $10 million from the third quarter to 2 basis points. Despite the challenges created by the pandemic, the commercial real estate portfolio has continued to perform well. Commercial real estate valuations and investment activity has rebounded off their lows across all property types, although there is still some risk in office and select hotel and retail segments. Consumer credit performance also remained strong with higher collateral values for homes and autos and consumer cash reserves remain above pre-pandemic levels. Consumer net charge-offs of $393 million increased $172 million from the third quarter. $152 million of the increase is related to a change in practice to fully charge off certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans. Nonperforming assets increased $145 million or 2% from the third quarter, driven by an increase in residential mortgage nonaccruals, primarily resulting from certain customers exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Loans that were modified in 2021 upon exiting forbearance are reported as nonaccrual until they perform for a period of time. Overall, early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have been aligned with our expectations. After increasing during the first four quarters of the pandemic, commercial nonperforming assets have declined for four consecutive quarters, and we're back to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. Our allowance level at the end of the fourth quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, the ongoing economic recovery and the uncertainties that still remain. If the economic recovery continues, we would expect to have additional reserve releases. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 2% from the third quarter with growth in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. We had strong growth late in the quarter and period-end loans grew $32.6 billion or 4% from the third quarter with broad-based growth across most of our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth geographies over when discussing business segment results. Average deposits increased $89.9 billion or 7% from a year ago with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking, partially offset by continued declines in corporate, investment banking and in corporate treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Turning to Net Interest Income on Slide 8. A year ago, we provided our expectation for 2021 net interest income to be flat to down 4% from the originally reported annualized fourth quarter 2020 level, and we ended up being down 3% for the full year. Fourth quarter net interest income was down $93 million or 1% from a year ago and grew $353 million or 4% from the third quarter. The increase in the third quarter was driven by higher loan balances, including higher interest income from loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs. We also benefited from higher trading assets and a favorable funding mix. In the fourth quarter, we had $318 million of interest income associated with EPBOs, and at year-end, we had a total of $17.3 billion of these loans, down from $34.8 highlighted last quarter, we expect these balances to decline substantially by the end of this year. We also had $130 million of interest income in the fourth quarter from Paycheck Protection Program loans or PPP loans, and are outstanding decline to $2.4 billion at year-end. We've reflected the headwind from these portfolios running off in our 2022 net interest income waterfall that I will review later on the call. The net interest margin increased 8 basis points from the third quarter 3 basis points of which was due to higher interest income from EPBOs. Now turning to Expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 11% from a year ago. The decrease reflected progress we made on our efficiency initiatives, including reductions in personnel costs, consultant spend and occupancy expense. I will provide specific examples of the progress we made in our efficiency initiatives in 2021 later on the call before updating you on our expense expectations for 2022. We also had lower restructuring charges and operating losses in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago. Fourth quarter expenses included one month or approximately $100 million of operating expenses from our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management prior to their sales on November 1. Now turning to our business segments starting with Consumer Banking lending on Slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily due to higher deposit-related fees as fourth quarter 2020 included some COVID-related fee waivers. Fourth quarter 2021 also reflected an increase in consumer activity, including higher debit card transactions compared with a year ago and the benefit of strong deposit growth was largely offset by lower spreads. Charlie highlighted the enhancements and changes we're making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees. The impact from the fees that will be reduced, including the elimination of nonsufficient fund or NSF fees as well as overdraft protection transfer fees, is estimated to be approximately $700 million annually. Also, we expect that they may be partially offset by other fees due to higher levels of activity as well as the expiration of various fee-related waivers that were in place in 2021. In terms of new features to be rolled out in the latter part of the year, including a 24-hour grace period for overdrafts and a new short-term loan product, we will have to observe how customers respond. Home lending revenue declined 8% from a year ago, primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, driven by lower gain on sale margins and origination volumes. Even before the recent rate back up, we started to see a drop in application volume in December, and we expect originations to decline in 2022, which will put pressure on margins as the industry adapts to the lower volume. Credit card revenue was up 3% from a year ago, driven by higher point-of-sale volume, partially offset by higher rewards costs, including promotional offers on our new active Cash Card. Auto revenue increased 17% from a year ago and higher loan balances with the average balances up $6.8 billion. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Our mortgage originations declined 7% from the third quarter. We expect our first quarter originations to continue to decline due to lower refinance activity and the typical seasonal slowdown in the purchase market. We increased our nonconforming originations in the fourth quarter and have grown our nonconforming portfolio for seven consecutive months, reflecting the improvements in our capabilities as well as the reintroduction of cash-out refinancing late in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to Auto. Limited vehicle inventories continued to constrain industry new car sales. However, we had our third consecutive quarter of record originations with volume up 77% from a year ago, with the majority of our originations coming from used cars. Originations also benefited from the enhancements we continue to make in our capabilities. Importantly, we are maintaining our underwriting standards and continue to be cautious about the increase in vehicle prices over the last year or so. Turning to Debit Card. Transactions were relatively stable from the third quarter and up 10% from a year ago with increases across nearly all categories. Credit card point of sale purchase volume continued to be strong, was up 28% from a year ago and 11% from the third quarter. While payment rates remain elevated, balances grew 5% from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products. New credit card accounts more than doubled from a year ago, driven by our new active cash card, and we're pleased by the quality of the accounts we've been attracting. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 2% from a year ago. Results included higher deposit balances and modestly higher investment banking fees, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 1% from a year ago, driven by higher net gains from equity securities and higher revenue from renewable energy investments, partially offset by lower loan balances. Noninterest expense declined 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower personnel and consulting expense due to the efficiency initiatives as well as lower lease expense. Loan balances started to increase late in the third quarter and now have grown for four consecutive months with growth accelerating in December. As with other portfolios, we are adhering to the same credit risk appetite. Increases in the Middle Market Banking were driven by growth from our larger clients, a modest uptick in revolver utilization and strong seasonal borrowing. Growth in asset-based lending and leasing was driven by new client wins as well as increased levels from higher prices and some increases in inventory levels. Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago. Investment Banking had a strong quarter, with higher debt origination and advisory fees. Banking results also benefited from higher loan estate revenue grew 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and capital markets results in stronger commercial real estate financing activity. Loan originations returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we had a healthy pipeline as we started the new year. Markets revenue was relatively stable from a year ago. It was down 14% from the third quarter, primarily due to lower trading activity in spread products and equity derivatives. Average deposits in Corporate and Investment Banking were down $23.7 billion from a year ago, driven by actions taken across all lines of business to manage under the asset cap. Average loans increased from both the third quarter and a year ago across all lines of business. On a period-end basis, loans grew every month since June and growth accelerated in December. Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 14. The revenue grew 6% from a year ago as higher asset-based fees and market valuations more than offset a decline in net interest income due to lower interest rates. The 5% increase in expenses from a year ago was primarily driven by higher revenue-related compensation, which was more than offset by higher revenue. This increase was partially offset by lower salaries expense, reflecting progress on efficiency initiatives. Client assets year ago, primarily driven by higher market valuations. Average deposits were up 7% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Slide 15 highlights our Corporate Results. Revenue increased from a year ago, driven by strong results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and gains on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $1.6 billion of revenue in 2021, excluding net gains on sale and $1.5 billion of noninterest expense. We expect approximately $200 million of these expenses associated with remain in 2022, with offsetting revenue so its P&L neutral. We also expect approximately $300 million of corporate overhead expenses related to these businesses to remain in 2022, which we expect to manage down over time. Turning now to our expectations for 2022, starting with Net Interest Income on Slide 16. As the last couple of weeks have demonstrated, it's challenging this early in the year to predict the rate environment, loan demand and other variables that impact net interest income for the full year. But let me highlight the key drivers of our net interest income for 2022. We are assuming the asset capital remain in place throughout 2022, moving left to right on the waterfall. As we have discussed previously, we have a headwind this year from the runoff of PPP and EPBO loans. However, our current outlook loans is for average balances to grow low to mid-single digits from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022, along with other balance sheet mix changes, this is expected to more than offset that headwind. This net result would increase net interest income approximately 3% in 2022 from the $35.8 billion we generated in 2021. Moving to rates and repricing. The recent forward curve includes approximately 325 basis point rate hikes this year beginning in May. Assuming these were to play out, net interest income has the potential to grow up to an additional 5%, resulting in approximately 8% net interest income growth in 2022 versus 2021. That said, the implied forward curve has changed a lot over the last 1.5 months, so it's very hard to forecast with any certainty. Another way to view our asset sensitivity is from the disclosure we provided in our third quarter 10-Q filing. It showed that the estimated impact of an instantaneous 50 basis points increase in short-term rates would increase net interest income by approximately $2.7 billion over the next 12 months. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2022 will depend on a variety of factors, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, loan demand and cash redeployment. Now turning to Expenses on Slide 17. We made progress last year on our efficiency initiatives and we continue to identify new opportunities. Our portfolio of initiatives that includes realized and identified potential gross saves has grown from approximately $8 billion to $10 billion, and we are continuing to work across the Company. We expect to execute on our remaining identified initiatives over the next two to three years, and we'll continue to invest across our businesses. Importantly, similar to last year, we are excluding from our efficiency initiatives the resources needed to address our risk and control work, and we'll continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work. We've been reducing expenses across our businesses, but let me highlight a few examples of the progress we made last year. We eliminated management layers and increased bank control with a 20% decrease in managers with low spending control. We completed approximately 270 branch consolidations in 2021, a continuation of the progress we've made the last few years with branches down 11% since 2019. We've also optimized branch our customers or how our customers are using our branches. Within our technology organization, we reduced non-engineering roles by approximately 40%, driven by accelerated adoption of the agile framework. And headcount across the Company declined approximately 6% from a year ago, excluding divested businesses. In addition to reducing the number of branches, we also reduced our office real estate portfolio by approximately 7% and occupancy expense was down 9% compared with a year ago. This year, we expect to continue to realize savings from these initiatives, including an incremental 5% reduction in office real estate. Additionally, the investments we're making in technology should drive improvements in operations, consumer banking, consumer lending, commercial banking. Importantly, these efforts should not only reduce expenses but also improve the customer experience with enhanced fraud detection, more service self-service capabilities and faster underwriting decisions. Now turning to our 2022 Expense Outlook on Slide 18. Following the waterfall from left to right, we reported $53.8 billion of noninterest expense in 2021. This was largely in line with our most recent guidance, except for higher operating losses. We had approximately $500 million of expenses in 2021 related to business exits and restructuring charges and the civil money penalty associated with the OCC enforcement action in September. We also had approximately $1 billion of expenses in 2021 from the Wells Fargo Asset Management and our Corporate Trust Services business, which were sold and that will not continue in 2022. So we believe a good starting point for the discussion of 2022 expenses is the $52.3 billion. We are assuming a modest increase in equity markets this year and expect revenue-related expenses to grow by approximately $300 million. This includes expected increases in Wealth and Investment Management and Corporate Investment Banking, partially offset by expected declines in home lending, reflecting lower origination volumes. Higher revenue-related compensation is a good thing, and the associated revenue will more than offset any increase in expenses. We also expect approximately $500 million of wage and benefits-related inflationary increases in 2022 above and beyond the normal level of merit and pay increases, driven by higher personnel expenses, including the minimum wage increase that Charlie highlighted and other compensation changes. Through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize approximately $3.3 billion of gross expense reductions from 2022. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by approximately $1.2 billion of incremental investments primarily related to higher personnel in expenses in commercial banking, corporate and investment banking and technology as well as increased spending on risk management. We also expect approximately $500 million in increased spending in other areas, including higher FDIC insurance assessments, higher travel and entertainment expenses, which were significantly lower in 2021 due to the pandemic. Accordingly, our full year 2022 expenses are expected to be approximately $51.5 billion, a net reduction of approximately $800 million versus the $52.3 billion. Embedded in our assumptions are approximately $1.3 billion of operating losses for 2022, which is the amount we had in 2021, excluding the $250 million associated with the OCC enforcement action. While we've made significant progress on working through legacy issues, as we've previously disclosed, we still have outstanding litigation and regulatory issues, and related expenses could significantly exceed the levels we had in 2021. We made substantial progress last year in executing our efficiency initiatives, but we still have significant opportunity to get more efficient across the Company. We are focused on achieving net expense reductions while appropriately investing in our businesses. This remains a multiyear process, with the ultimate goal of achieving an efficiency ratio in line with our peers and based on our business mix. We'll now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question of the day will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Sir, your line is open. John McDonald : Mike, I was wondering if you could give us some sense of if the asset cap remains in place, how much capacity do you have to grow loans? Obviously, the H8 data is picking up. It feels like loan growth is getting better for the industry. I just want to make sure that you're invited to that party and you guys can grow loans while staying under the asset cap. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. John, thanks for the question. So just as you know, and I think it's implicit in what you asked, but the constraint for us on the asset cap is really on the deposit side. And so that's the part where we're actively taking action to make sure we've got the room we need particularly for our retail clients, and we're continuing to do that. On the loan side, we still have -- we're not constrained on growth on the loan side, so we still have plenty of room to continue to grow with our clients. John McDonald : And could you give us some sense, in your NII outlook, what kind of loan growth you're building in and also liquidity deployment assumptions? And how you're thinking about liquidity deployment given where the curve is here? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, sure. Embedded in -- on Slide 16, we've assumed kind of low to mid-single-digit growth when you compare fourth quarter '21 to fourth quarter '22. And so hopefully, we're optimistic that we'll be able to get there and maybe there's certainly some scenarios where it could be -- it could grow faster than that, but that's the assumption that we use there. Embedded in that column too on the chart in the loan growth and other balance sheet stuff is some modest redeployment into the securities portfolio, I'd say modest so sort of single -- kind of mid- to low-single digit sort of increases in the securities portfolio as well. And so, those are the assumptions embedded there. And I think as we look at where the curve is today, we're still being, overall, pretty prudent and patient, but we are in a very kind of small way, beginning to buy some securities in the portfolio. Operator : The next question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open. Ken Usdin : Mike, you had mentioned that where you did a little bit better last year, $4 billion of gross saves versus what you originally thought at $3.6 billion, and you just commented that you still have a good line of sight as far as efficiency initiatives. Can you help us understand, like $3.3 billion for this year, how you're feeling about that? But more importantly, that line of sight, how far out do you have that? And do you continue to see an ability to take out this type of cost as you go forward even past this year? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No. And Ken, what we're really trying to do is make sure we embed this in the DNA of how we operate the place, and so that's ultimately what's going to be really important for us over the long run. And I think you're seeing that. The portfolio grew from 8 billion to 10 billion in terms of the initiatives that we've either executed on or in the process of executing. And so, I think you're seeing sort of that progress and growth there. So, you can sort of do the math of what we've accomplished so far, what we've identified for this year and what's left for next year. And I continue to believe that we've got more to do that we haven't sort of built into that portfolio yet. And so, the team continues to work on that every day. As you look at our confidence level on the $3.3 billion that we put into the forecast, we feel good. We've got really good line of sight. And I think given what the team was able to do last year, we have confidence that we'll be able to execute on that. Charles Scharf : Let me just add to something that Mike said, which is I'm always -- I'm a firm believer on these efficiency initiatives, especially in a company like this. Even if you go back over a decade, one of the strengths of this company was never efficiency. It was far more on the revenue side. And so, as we get the efficiencies that we're starting to see, it is like peeling the onion back, where then the next set of opportunities become even clearer. And so, we're ginning up the same process that we did at the beginning of this venture where we came up with initial $8 billion to back and say, okay, now what's next in a very methodical way across the Company. So we feel -- I feel really good about what's in our numbers for next year. And we're going to continue to pursue this. And I think it's, just as you've seen in our numbers, it gives us the ability to spend our investments and to become more efficient overall as a company. So, I personally don't feel like we're close to done. Ken Usdin : Got it. And if I could just ask the other side of that question too, which is that you're doing a little less than incremental investments versus what you did last year, how do you get comfortable that you're doing enough, especially what we're hearing from the industry pressures, not just inflation but just on the need to continue to, and you mentioned this, Charlie, about all the new things you're rolling out? But how do you land on that number? And how do you get the confidence that it's the right amount that you're reinvesting? Charles Scharf : Yes, it's a good question. I think we do I think what most good companies do, which is they sit around tables and they ask everyone to come back with what you want to spend money on and then figure out what you can actually do. I think we've accomplished a tremendous amount on the technology side since Saul Van Beurden, who runs technology for us, was brought in. And I think we're going to try and spend as much as we physically can get done. But I think we're always asking the question of what's next. But I think the different position that we're in versus others is we're still in the ramping-up stage, which I also look at as opportunity because we have moved slower historically investing in some of these areas. And to the extent that we find more efficiency money, it gives us the opportunity to spend more broadly. But I do feel -- I think we as a company, we as a management team do feel good about what we're investing next year relative to where we stand as a company. Operator : The next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : I had two questions. One was on the overdraft fees that you mentioned. I think you said that it was like a $700 million impact, but we look at the regulatory filings and the regulatory filings show a higher level of overdraft fee run rate like in the $1 billion kind of range. So I'm just trying to understand what -- why would it be only $700 million? Charles Scharf : Well, first of all, I mean, we're not eliminating overdraft fees. We're making a series of changes that we think makes sense for the consumer. We have an account that doesn't allow overdraft but we have an account that does allow overdraft. And so we think it's got -- it's more consumer-friendly than it was in the past, but we do continue to believe that there are a substantial number of customers out there that want us to pay overdraft on their behalf after they've worked through a bunch of the buffers and benefits we're giving them, and they're willing to pay for that. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay. So the NSF fees will be eliminated but you'll have a different product that comes in? Charles Scharf : Well, no, it's the same -- NSF fees will be eliminated entirely. Our overdraft fee will stay, but we've added a series of things such as we'll give you availability on direct deposits two days in advance. We'll give you an additional 24 hours after you otherwise would have been charged for an overdraft to cure it. So our overdraft fees will go down, but we're still going to be providing the overdraft product and we'll still be charging for it. Betsy Graseck : Okay. All right. So my bad because I thought overdraft and NSF were pretty similar, but that's not... Mike Santomassimo : Yes, I think -- Betsy, think of the NSF fees as when you don't pay something into overdraft like a check and you return it, then historically, you would have charged a fee for that returned item. That's an NSF fee. The overdraft fees come into play when you actually pay something in overdraft. Betsy Graseck : Yes. Yes, I got it. Okay. So I was using too much jargon and that's my bad. All right. And then the second question is on the loan growth that you were talking about earlier in the prepared remarks and with John. LIBOR is no longer able to be used as a reference rate for C&I or CRE or any loan or any product rights starting Jan 1. How does that impact you? Is that -- could that be a benefit to your loan growth in C&I and CRE? And how are you thinking about shifting the reference rate that you're going to be using with your clients? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I mean, we've started that shift already as you would imagine, right? And we started -- we stopped offering new -- effectively stopped offering new LIBOR-based loan products in the -- at some point in the fourth quarter. We've probably done, in the wholesale side, maybe including WIM, so take out the consumer mortgage business, we've done something like 4,500 or just under that new facilities based on SOFR, with the large majority -- and obviously, there's different ways to calculate SOFR, the large majority of those are using sort of a daily simple rate. So if SOFR moves, obviously, that will adjust. And so I think we're seeing clients start to get used to it and start to use it. Complementing what we're doing on the wholesale side is we've got -- we've stopped offering LIBOR-based ARMs last year. And so we've got, I don't know, tens of thousands -- a couple of tens of thousands at this point in terms of ARMs on the books using using SOFR there as well. And so I think it's starting to take hold. Betsy Graseck : Yes, I was just thinking like the capital markets might not be deep enough yet to be competitive against SOFR or product at least for the first half of this year. So could that give you a little advantage here in originating? Mike Santomassimo : I don't see that having a huge impact on loan growth but maybe we'll be surprised a little bit, but I don't see that happening. Betsy Graseck : All right, because I didn't think the CLO bid was there yet for SOFR. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I guess I don't see that happening. I think there are starting to be some CLOs and SOFR, but like I don't see that happen being a big driver. Operator : The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Mike, my first question is for you. Could you give us a sense of what deposit growth or runoff assumption you have in your 2022 NII simulation? And similarly, what kind of deposit repricing you presume? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No, thanks, Erika. Look, as you can guess, like we're in a bit of a different spot than others, right, given our asset cap. And so, we're already constrained on deposits and so we're pushing away deposits every week now. And so, I don't expect this year to have much of a runoff in deposits. And if we start to see deposit levels going down, we'll stop pushing others off. And so I don't see that going to be a big driver for 2022. As you think about betas and deposit pricing assumptions, it's largely similar to what we saw the last rate cycle. But I would say that over the last three, four, five years, our deposit base has changed quite a bit. If you look at just based on the segments we are in, as a shorthand, where 57% of our deposits are in our consumer and small business banking business today. If you go back a number of years, that was probably closer to 43% or 45%. And so the remixing of sort of our deposits as a result of some of the actions we've had to take will kind of lower the overall beta for the first number of rate hikes. But I think it will look pretty similar to what we saw. And as you can imagine, since we're constrained on growing deposits, we're not going to be the leader on pricing likely as we go over the next number of quarters. Erika Najarian : And just to clarify, so the betas in the last cycle, if I remember, were driven by a handful of CIB deposits, right? Clearly, that has been pushed out, given assets -- some of that has been pushed out, given asset cap restrictions. So embedded in this NII number is the experience of the last cycle that included the betas contributed by those deposits, whereas as we actually look out today, you have a much better and less rate-sensitive deposit base. Mike Santomassimo : For sure. And the betas might be similar on the CIB deposits. We just have less of them as a percentage of the overall book, which lowers our overall beta. Charles Scharf : Just the mix. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, so -- but we'll see. And a lot of that will be driven by what we see in the competitive environment, right? So particularly on those wholesale deposits, but it will have a smaller impact on us than it did in the past, just given the mix. Erika Najarian : Understood. And my last question is for Charlie. I think your investors are receiving very warmly what you and Mike have said about you're trying to change how this bank is thinking by constantly identifying cost saves to fund future investments. And as we look out in what looks like a more favorable rate backdrop and revenue backdrop, from a growth perspective for banks, do you see yourself reinvesting more of the identified savings as we enter a more favorable revenue backdrop? Charles Scharf : I don't think -- I guess the way I'd put it is we don't think about it relative to what the rate scenario is or how much we're making in NII. I think, again, just think about where we are in the stage of our evolution, which is we're limiting our investments based upon just what can physically be done, not based upon how much we actually want to spend. I mean, there are always a couple of small places around the place where people want to spend and you do have to prioritize. I think a lot of the answer to your question will have to do, as we continue to do our work strategically, to determine where we want to create additional capabilities across the Company, we would expect the investment number to grow for sure. But also, as you know, we're spending a lot of money on infrastructure. And I'm not talking about the risk build-out. I'm just talking about the basic infrastructure of the Company. So I think as we sit here today, we still think that we have an opportunity to both become much more efficient and to continue to grow the level of investments that are going to drive business results inside the Company. And that's I would say, is focused upon where we think we need to get to relative to how much money we should be spending as a company as opposed to any upside that we had because of just the change in rates at this point. Erika Najarian : Got it. That's clear. Thank you. Charles Scharf : And no reason I would add, I just think for us, that just -- it takes the pressure off of us to think that if we were to think that way. If we were to say, okay, because if nothing we've done, rates have gone up, we then start spending a lot more money. We're still in this -- as I said earlier, we're still in this phase of challenging ourselves to become as efficient as we should be. And that -- having that pressure across the Company at this stage for us is still a good thing, just as it is to challenge people to come up with where we should be investing. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O'Connor: So I wanted to ask about the cap. And can you just remind us like where you are in the process from your perspective? Have you implemented everything that you submitted in your proposal and it's just a matter of consistently executing on those changes? Or are there still, call it, material changes that you're making to address those issues? Charles Scharf : Matt, I understand you're very consistent in wanting to know the answer and I certainly appreciate that. We have, across all of this regulatory work. We still have a substantial amount to do. It's really not right for me to talk about under any specific consent order where we think we are in the process because, again, what I said ultimately is what's going to matter is whether our regulators believe it's done to their satisfaction. And it's really unhealthy to get into the game of do we think we're done? Do we think they're making the right conclusions? I think it's on us to continue to do all that's necessary. And when they're comfortable that we've satisfied those obligations, they will make that determination. And so I just -- again, I'm sorry. I understand why you seek more detail, but it's just a difficult thing and probably not the right thing for us to get to that level of specificity. Matt O'Connor: I appreciate that. And I know I ask this line of question kind of every quarter, but obviously, it's such a key part for the stock. And I know I've also asked this kind of follow-up question. I think you have like a slew of local regulators on site or at least on site virtually. But I think there's a perception that it's kind of more of the central regulators that are kind of going to be the ones that make the call. And just remind us, in general, what is like the frequency of the dialogue with some more of those central regulators? And just any flavor you can add on the communication there? Charles Scharf : I think it's fair that I think I would speak for most big banks that the level of dialogue with both local staff and with D.C. is substantial and meaningful. I mean, I can just tell you, even from my last role, it's the right thing to do. Again, we certainly have increased, I think, the level of dialogue that we have since the new team has gotten here. And it's hard to put specific how often we do it. But it's very, very regular. And I think it's true that all of the big banks, both the local staff as well as the staff in D.C. are both extremely important in their monitoring and the way they draw conclusions about the Company. And we worked hard to treat both extremely respectfully. There's a very direct and open communication on their side as far as I can tell. And as I said, we say the same to the local people as we do to the D.C. staff. But again, they're a very, very important part of the journey that we're on. And we want them to be as knowledgeable about what's going on here on all of these important issues. And we're always available and willing to have those conversations with them. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Mike, I wanted to ask in a little bit more detail about rate positioning. I think I can figure this out mostly from your guidance disclosures but would still be curious to hear your thoughts. Just with your significant asset sensitivity, can you talk a little bit about sort of where you're most sensitive on the curve and sort of when and how you'll benefit like, put simply, is the first hike, the same benefit as the third and so on? Or where is it more -- where or when is it more or less powerful? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And to state the obvious, probably the short end of the curve is most meaningful, right? So when you look at just the whole curve shifting up, something like 2/3 of the benefit ends up being on the short end. And so that's going to be by far the most meaningful piece of it. I think for the first number of rate rises, it's hard to say exactly how many. I think the first three or four, though, it's pretty linear. And you can use our disclosures as a way to sort of model that. You get it earlier in the -- you get it in March, it's worth a quarter or more than if you get it in June and so forth. And so it's a pretty good guide at this point to use it that way. Scott Siefers : Okay, perfect. And then just separately, so one of the criticisms on the story over the past few years is been that there are a number of competitors, a lot of smaller banks out there that sort of suggest that it's still pretty easy to steal talent and business from Wells Fargo. Your emerging loan growth seems to be running kind of contrary to what's been that argument for the last couple of years. Can you just sort of touch on that criticism and sort of where you are in terms of comfort with sort of stability and growth of the workforce? Charles Scharf : Yes. Listen, I feel -- we feel great about the people that we have here. And I've listened to that for quite a while since I've been here. And when I ask people for specifics, very little seems to come back. Listen, it's a very, very competitive workplace. We lose people to competition. We hire people from competition of all sizes. I think I would say, as I've said before, when you look at the team that we have in place, both at a senior level all the way down to people that we cover customers, I feel great about it. And I can honestly tell you, we -- I'm trying to remember, Mike, keep me honest here, if we sat around a room and talked about, \"Gee. Oh my God, look at all the people that we're losing to these smaller competitors and what are we going to do about it?\" That conversation hasn't happened. And we're very knowledgeable about attrition that's happening at the Company. So if a small company hires a banker, it might be a big deal for them. We're lucky enough to have a very broad set of coverage officers. But that's not to say it's not competitive. So maybe they're right, but we feel good about the people that are here, and we're going to work hard to keep the people that are here. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And I would just add a little color. We've been happy at what we've been able to recruit in places like the investment bank. We've hired almost a few like two to three dozen sort of relatively senior investment bankers. We've hired a bunch of people in the commercial bank on the front line. And so I think as Charlie said, it's definitely competitive. And you could always find an anecdotal story of where somebody left to go do a bigger job at a smaller place or so forth. But we feel -- I think the teams feel good about being able to attract good people into the roles. And so obviously, we've got to be competitive on pay. We've got to be -- but I think people are attracted to the franchise and attracted to the sort of direction. And so far, it's been constructive there. Charles Scharf : Yes. And I just want to say one other thing, which is especially when you get down into places like the Commercial Bank and different businesses that cover consumers. As we've talked about having to improve the talent in some parts of the Company, the talent that we have in those areas is really exceptional and it's really deep. And it's a huge strength of the Company. It's been a strength of the Company for a very long time. So again, I think that might tell you just how we think about the people that we have. And again, we never want to lose good people, but it happens. But it's not something that we worry about hurting the franchise at this point. Operator : The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : On the low single-digit to mid-single-digit loan growth assumption, can you give us a little more detail on how that breaks out among the products, either in core C&I versus commercial real estate and consumer? And then separately, are there any areas of the loan book that you're really emphasizing at this point or seeing opportunities to ramp your activity similar to what you've been doing on the credit card side? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Look, it's a little bit of growth really across the board, John. And I think we're seeing opportunity really everywhere. And I think if you look at -- on the card side, we are expecting to see some growth in the card side. Some of that will be like through revolve balances. Some of that will be some of the intro balances coming off the new products, which will start to really pay off at the end of next year into the year after. We've been really happy with what we've seen in the auto space, which in this environment are pretty good assets, pretty short-lived assets and high quality in terms of what we've seen there. So we see some continued opportunity to grow there. And then on the consumer side, you have to go a little bit -- I'm sorry, on the mortgage side, you have to go a little bit below the covers. And if you look at the nonconforming space, we are seeing some growth there, which we think will continue as we go into the year. That's offset by these EPBO loans going away. But nonetheless, we see some growth there. So it's really -- and I gave some color on the Commercial Banking stuff in my comments. And we do expect some more opportunity in the multifamily and apartments and asset classes like that in commercial real estate. So in places like commercial real estate, we're being really targeted about it. And even where you see a little limited growth in places like office in the quarter, and even in places like that, cash to equity ratios are up, structures are better, spreads are better, given sort of what we've -- the way we're managing that. So we're being really cautious in that space. But I do think it will be a little bit of growth across the board if we're successful. John Pancari : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then separately, on the buyback front, buybacks came a little bit better than we had expected in the fourth quarter. Maybe if you can just give us your thoughts on the outlook there and your appetite buybacks and also the -- how you're thinking about the dividend here in terms of deployment? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Look, I think we've talked about this before, and we're maybe in a different spot than others, just given some of the constraints we have on the asset cap. But we still feel like we've got excess capital. You can see that in the numbers yourself. We do expect that we'll continue to see some loan growth. So that will drive some RWA and so that -- we've got to be thoughtful about that. And so, as we laid out earlier last year, we said we would do at least $18 billion of buybacks through the four-quarter period ending next -- in the second quarter. That still is achievable and we potentially have the opportunity to go above that if we decide that's the right path either this quarter or next quarter. So we'll look at sort of how we feel with all the things we got to think about and make that decision. As you sort of think about the dividend, I think Charlie covered this a couple of times last year is, you think about a payout ratio that we hope to get to on a normalized basis to take out some of the onetime things that you see in the results, it's really kind of a 30% to 40% payout ratio is what we target over time. And that just takes some time to get there. And so I think we'll -- ultimately, that's a Board decision in terms of when and how much we increase the dividend. But we'll -- we're still marching down that path and -- but it takes some time to get there. Operator : The next question comes from David Long of Raymond James. Your line is open. David Long : You've talked in the past about the operating expense savings being a multiyear plan and/or initiative. And so with your guidance this year in the $51.5 billion range, should we be expecting 2023 operating expenses to still be below that level? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Look, at this point, as we think about it, our goal would be to see a net reduction next year. I think we'll obviously give you more guidance on how that's progressing as we get towards the end of the year. And that will be a function of what we think we can invest properly and what inflation looks like and a whole bunch of factors. But we're certainly given what our view on the efficiency side is targeting that, but we'll give you more guidance on that later in the year. I don't know if you have anything to add. David Long : Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, a little bit longer down the road, once the consent orders are mostly in the past, if you replace the cost today to improve and upgrade your internal operations with the expected cost to sort of just maintain proper controls and risk management for efforts, how much savings do you see there? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Look, I think there is some savings there, but that's -- our focus now is getting the work done and getting all the stuff in place and making sure it's operating properly. And so we're focused a little bit -- we're being thoughtful about how we implement that stuff, but our focus is a little bit less on making it the most efficient and optimized process. So we will get there when that stuff is all done and running for a while, but it -- that's a few years off, I think, in terms of really optimizing the risk and compliance. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : So just wanted to squeeze one more question in here just on the fee outlook. A fair amount of noise in the fee line this quarter, I know you didn't give an explicit fee guide for 2022. But as we reflect the impact of business sales, the overdraft change, some weaker mortgage banking and normalization equity gains, how should we be thinking about the right jumping-off point for fee income, just looking ahead to next quarter and '22, just more broadly? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I think you just outlined it, to be honest. I think you just have to take the lines, right? And I know we've talked about this on calls before. Like if you look at one of the biggest fee lines, you take the investment advisory and other asset-based fees, that's a function of our client assets and what the equity market is doing primarily. And so that's probably something that you can model. And we've got -- that grew a bit as we went through the year last year. And then I think as you said, we're in the mortgage space, we'll see some -- the fourth quarter number in the consumer side is probably a good place to start your jumping-off point and modeling. And as I think others have spoken about too is we all expect the mortgage market to be down with refinancings really driving that. And how well we do will be a function of how well we're able to sort of penetrate on the purchase side. So hopefully, we're down a little less than what the market is, but that will be a function of what we can deliver. And so I think you just got to take each of those lines and sort of model it forward. Steven Chubak : And maybe I'll just squeeze one more in, if I can. Just on the earlier discussion around excess liquidity deployment. It looked like you deployed some of that excess in the quarter. And yet, if I look relative to pre-pandemic levels, you've still seen a doubling of excess reserves and those deposits that you guys have on balance sheet, as you noted earlier, should be stickier as the Fed initiates QT just given some of the changes in deposit mix. I was hoping you could just size the amount of excess liquidity available for deployment today. And if the long end continues to grind higher, is there any appetite or willingness to deploy more aggressively than that mid-single-digit growth that's contemplated in the NII walk? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I mean, the first thing we'll be looking at is how fast loans are growing, right? So obviously, that's like the place you'd want to -- you'd see that liquidity get deployed first to support customers. And so that will be a function of what we think is going to happen over a series of quarters. But -- and I think when you look at the securities portfolio, we have done a lot in the last year, both in increasing our mortgage exposure, increasing our structured product CLO exposure. The place that you saw the decline was really in the treasury side. And so given sort of what's happening in the rate environment. And so I think you will see us start deploying more. And as I mentioned earlier, we've started in a very small way already given sort of what we've seen over the last couple of weeks. And I think really how much -- how fast we go or how much we go will be both a function of what we think is going to happen with rates but also how fast we think loans will grow. And so those two things, I think, will drive sort of the pace. And at this point, embedded in our outlook or considerations there, we do expect a modest increase in the portfolio. And so we'll see how -- but we'll make that determination based on all the factors there that I mentioned. Operator : The final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Charlie, you talked about joining the Net-Zero Alliance as with some of your peers. Can you frame out for us, as you guys get deeper into that and your peers do as well? How should we try to estimate what types of risks you might be coming up against? And how do you guys monitor those risks? Charles Scharf : Listen, I think it's a great question. I think it's the question that everyone is asking. And I think the whole point about joining these alliances is to ensure that we're all benefiting from each other's experiences, and those that have experienced this in other parts of the world to understand how to actually think about that. What we're doing is we're going through how we think the impact of climate on a much longer-term basis can impact all of the different businesses from a risk perspective but also understanding where the opportunities for us are. And so whenever we talk about where we're going on climate with our goal to get to net zero, I think people too often jump to that means we're going to stop doing things. First of all, what we're trying to do is to assure that we're doing everything we can to help all of our clients transition. And that doesn't mean walking away from clients. It means helping them invest in areas, whether it is -- and we can do that in lots of different ways across the Company with our own balance sheet or the public markets to invest in very, very different ways. And I think what you'll start to see from us and others is a lot more disclosure on what the embedded risks are, but also all the different things that we're doing to play our part in reducing emissions more broadly. So I just think it's a question that I think we should continue to ask as we all continue to provide more significant disclosures than we've all done in the past on the topic. Gerard Cassidy : I appreciate that. Thank you. And pivoting to the follow-up question on credit, obviously, your guys' credit is fantastic like the industry, considering what we just came through. Can you give us some color on the reserve? I assume as we normalize credit, you and your peers, how should we be looking at the reserve building over the next -- in 2022 going into 2023, the loan loss reserve building, that is? Charles Scharf : Well, let me start, Mike, and then you just pick up. I think the one thing I obviously, I think you guys all know this is not everyone starts at the same position when you look across what people have done with reserving across the industry. I think we feel very good about where we are relative to what we're seeing. We all have to make determinations. Remember, on a forward-looking basis as to what the embedded losses are. And I think everyone's got a different point of view on that on the way that looks. And I think we're at the -- we're doing the right thing, but I still think it's our assumptions are appropriate and conservative. And beyond that, remember, the idea of looking forward in terms of what's going to change in addition to just loan growth and making sure that we provide for growth in the balance sheet. It's going to depend on the ultimate outcome of the performance of the economy. And so as we sit here today, we feel very, very good about it. But it can take lots of different turns. And hopefully, we're still insulated from some level of downturn from where we sit today, given the assumptions that we've made because of the uncertainty that exists in the environment. So I'm not worried about where we are in 2022 personally, but I think as we look beyond that, it's a living breathing calculation. Charles Scharf : Listen, thank you very much, everyone, for the time, and we appreciate it, and we will talk to you over the next quarter. Take care. Bye-bye. Operator : Thanks, everyone, for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today\u2019s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I\u2019d also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today\u2019s call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll make some brief comments about our first quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I\u2019ll then turn the call over to Mike to review the first quarter results in more detail, before we take your questions. Let me start off with some first quarter highlights. We earned $3.7 billion or $0.88 per common share in the first quarter. Our results included $0.21 per share impact from a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. We have broad-based loan growth with both, our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the fourth quarter, while net interest income was down modestly from the fourth quarter, driven by fewer days in the quarter. It grew 5% from a year ago. Higher interest rates, along with our expectations for continued loan growth, should drive higher net interest income growth than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. Mike will provide more details regarding our current view later on in the call. However, the increase in rates negatively impacted our mortgage banking business. The mortgage origination market experienced one of its largest quarterly declines that I can remember, and it will take time for the industry to reduce excess capacity. Credit performance remained incredibly strong, and our net charge-off ratio declined to 14 basis points. While we have minimal direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine, we\u2019re monitoring certain industries that have the potential to be impacted by the conflict and economic sanctions, but thus far don\u2019t have concerns. In addition, we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, including repurchasing $6 billion of common stock and increasing our common stock dividend to $0.25 per share. The significant changes we\u2019ve made across the Company have put us in a position to increase the dividend and our work continues. The health of our consumer and businesses so far has remained strong, though we\u2019re entering a period of uncertainty. March was the eighth straight month in which inflation outpaced income with lower income consumers being most impacted by rising energy and food prices. That said, higher deposit balances and rising wages have thus far allowed consumers to weather these headwinds. We continued to see median deposit balances above pre-pandemic levels, up approximately 25% compared to 2020, but down from the highs observed in 2021. Consumer credit card spend remained strong, up 33% from a year ago. All spending categories were up with the highest growth in travel, entertainment, fuel and dining. After strong growth in the first quarter of 2021, driven by stimulus payments, debit card spending increased 6% in the first quarter of 2022. Discretionary spending remained strong with entertainment up 39% and travel up 29% from a year ago. The increase in energy prices was reflected in a 27% increase in fuel spending. Loan demand from our commercial customers increased with growth in both commitments and loans outstanding as customers\u2019 borrowing needs are increasing to fund working capital expansion. Credit quality remained strong with net recoveries in our commercial portfolio. Now, let me update you on progress we\u2019ve made on our strategic priorities. Building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and I continue to believe that we\u2019re making significant progress. Early in the first quarter, we named Derek Flowers, our new Chief Risk Officer, following Mandy Norton\u2019s retirement announcement. Derek has extensive experience managing risk including the work he\u2019s done over the last several years of managing the build-out of Wells Fargo\u2019s risk and control framework. Derek has been with Wells Fargo for over 20 years and his familiarity with the Company and his risk background make him the ideal candidate to succeed Mandy, who I\u2019d like to thank for the tremendous progress she made in transforming the risk organization. We also continue to make progress in resolving legacy regulatory issues with news in January that the OCC had terminated a consent order regarding add-on products that the Company sold to retail banking customers before 2015. We have much more work to do to satisfy our regulatory requirements, and we will likely have setbacks, but I\u2019m confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years. We remain focused on improving our financial performance while investing to drive growth across our businesses. Providing our customers with simple, easy to use and fast digital experiences is one of our most important strategic priorities. In the first quarter, we began rolling out our new mobile banking experience for our customers in our consumer businesses, and feedback has been very positive. Digital adoption, which is critical to both delivering seamless digital experiences that our customers expect and reducing the cost to serve has continued to increase with mobile active customers up 4% from a year ago. We added approximately 500,000 new mobile active customers in the first quarter alone. We continue to invest to improve our digital capabilities with additional enhancements planned for this year. We\u2019re also focused on reducing friction and moving money. We\u2019ve continued to invest in Zelle and made changes to expand customer usage, including increasing sending limits. These changes have helped to drive 21% growth in active send customers and a 33% increase in send volume from a year ago. We continued to enhance our credit card offerings with our partnership with Bilt Rewards and MasterCard. This first of its kind co-brand card allows members to pay rent and earn points with no transaction fees on rent payments at any apartment in the U.S. In the first quarter, we selected nCino to streamline our origination, underwriting and portfolio management for our small business customers. This collaboration is expected to provide our customers with a more streamlined lending experience and builds on our existing relationship that we announced last year to accelerate our digital transformation within our Commercial Banking and corporate investment banking businesses. Let me just make some summary comments before I turn it over to Mike. As we sit here today, our internal indicators continue to point towards the strength of our customers\u2019 financial position but the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will take actions necessary to reduce inflation and this will certainly reduce economic growth. In addition, the war in Ukraine adds additional risk to the downside. Wells Fargo is positioned well to provide support for our clients in a slowing economy. While we will likely see an increase in credit losses from historical lows, we should be a net beneficiary as we will also benefit from rising rates, we have a strong capital position, and our lower expense base creates greater margins from which to invest. We remain diligent in extending credit and are focusing on managing the other risk types within the Company as well. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we\u2019ve discussed in the past on a run rate basis at some point this year. We continue to focus on a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. As we have all seen, the reports and images coming out of Ukraine are deeply concerning. In order to support those most impacted, we announced $1 million in donations across three nonprofits in support of humanitarian aid for Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees as well as services that support the U.S. military. Earlier this week, we also announced plans to introduce HOPE Inside centers in select branches to increase access to financial education and guidance. Working with Operation HOPE is one important way that we can remove barriers to financial inclusion as part of our banking inclusion initiative, which is focused on helping more people who are unbanked gain access to affordable mainstream banking products. Since the pandemic began, close to 100,000 of our employees never left the workplace. And last month, we started to welcome the rest back to the office. It\u2019s been great to be back together again, and I want to thank all of our employees as they work together to better serve our customers, our communities and each other. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.7 billion or $0.88 per common share, and our results included a $1.1 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses, predominantly due to reduced uncertainty around the economic impact of COVID on our loan portfolios. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 16%, which included net discrete income tax benefits due to stock-based compensation. We expect our effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately 18%, excluding any additional discrete items. Our CET1 ratio declined to 10.5%, still well above our regulatory minimum of 9.1%. We highlight capital on slide 3. The decrease in our CET1 ratio from the fourth quarter reflected a $5.1 billion reduction in cumulative other comprehensive income, driven by higher interest rates and wider agency MBS spreads, which reduced the ratio by approximately 40 basis points. Higher risk-weighted assets driven by growth in loan balances and commitments, we adopted the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk, which had a minimal impact on total risk-weighted assets, and we continued with our strong capital returns. We repurchased $6 billion of common stock in the first quarter, bringing our total repurchases since the third quarter of 2021 to $18.3 billion, which is in line with our 2021 capital plan. While we have flexibility under the stress capital buffer framework to exceed the share repurchases contemplated in our capital plan, we will be disciplined in our approach, given the current rate volatility and currently expect to have significantly lower levels of share buybacks in the second quarter. Finally, we\u2019ve submitted our 2022 capital plan. And as I\u2019ve called out before, it\u2019s possible that our stress capital buffer could increase when the Federal Reserve publishes our official stress capital buffer in the third quarter, while our GSIB surcharge of 1.5% will remain the same for 2023. Turning to credit quality on slide 5. Our net loan charge-off ratio declined to 14 basis points in the first quarter. Commercial credit performance was strong again with $29 million of net recoveries in the first quarter driven by recoveries in energy, asset-based lending and middle market. Consumer credit performance was also strong. Credit losses were down $59 million from the fourth quarter, which included $152 million of net charge-offs related to a change in practice to fully charge off certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans. The first quarter included higher auto losses and seasonally higher credit card losses. Nonperforming assets decreased $323 million or 4% from the fourth quarter. Commercial nonaccruals were down $423 million, declining again this quarter and are now below pre-pandemic levels. Consumer nonaccruals increased $82 million, driven by an increase in residential mortgage non-accruals, primarily resulting from certain customers exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Overall, early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have exceeded our expectations. Our allowance for credit losses at the end of the first quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, less uncertainty around the economic impact of COVID, the economic recovery thus far and an outlook that reflects the increasing risks from high inflation in the Russian-Ukraine conflict. On slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 3% from a year ago in the fourth quarter. Period-end loans grew for the third consecutive quarter and were up 6% from a year ago, with growth in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. I\u2019ll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing business segment results. Average deposits increased $70.6 billion or 5% from a year ago, with growth in our consumer businesses and Commercial Banking, partially offset by continued declines in Corporate and Investment Banking and corporate treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Turning to net interest income on slide 7. First quarter net interest income increased $413 million or 5% from a year ago and declined $41 million from the fourth quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter was driven by $178 million of lower income from EPBO and Paycheck Protection Program loans as well as two fewer days in the quarter, which offset the impact of higher earning asset yields and higher securities and loan balances. Last quarter, we highlighted that net interest income for full year 2022 could potentially increase by approximately 8%, driven by loan growth and other balance sheet mix changes as well as the benefit from rising rates, which was based on the forward curve at that time. Obviously, a lot has changed over the past three months. Loan growth has been solid and average loan balances were up 3% versus the fourth quarter and 2% at period end. If we continue to see increased demand, it\u2019s possible that average loan balances will be up in the mid-single digits from the fourth quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2022, up from our prior outlook earlier this year of low to mid-single digits. The rate increase is currently included in the forward rate curve would also drive stronger net interest income growth than we anticipated earlier in the year. However, it\u2019s important to note that the benefit from rising rates is not linear, and we would expect deposit betas to accelerate after the initial rate hikes and customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products would also likely increase. Higher rates will also have a negative impact on mortgage volumes and potentially on market-related fees in Corporate and Investment Banking, private equity and venture capital businesses and in wealth management. Given our current expectations for higher loan growth and recent forward rate curves, net interest income for full year 2022 could be up mid-teens on a percentage basis from 2021. That said, net interest income growth will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas and loan growth. Now, turning to expenses on slide 8. Noninterest expense declined 1% from a year ago. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives and expenses also declined due to divestitures last year. The first quarter included approximately $600 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement eligible employees and 401(k) matching contributions. We also had $673 million of operating losses, which were primarily driven by higher customer remediation expense, predominantly for a variety of historical matters. Our full year 2022 expenses are still expected to be approximately $51.5 billion. However, as we experienced this quarter, operating losses can be episodic and hard to predict, and we will continue to update you on our expense expectations throughout the year. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and lending on slide 9. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to higher deposit balances, higher deposit-related fees, primarily reflecting lower fee waivers and an increase in debit card transactions. We continue to reduce the underlying cost to run the business and serve customers. Customers have continued to migrate to digital channels and correspondingly teller transactions are down 45% from pre-pandemic levels. Over the same period, we\u2019ve decreased our number of branches by 12% and branch staffing by approximately 30%, and we have more opportunities to improve our efficiency while we continue to make enhancements to better serve customers. Earlier this year, we announced changes that we are making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees. We began to implement some of these new policies and we\u2019ll be rolling out the rest of the changes this year. We eliminated fees for nonsufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions in early March. So, these changes didn\u2019t have a meaningful impact on the first quarter results. We still expect the annual decline in these fees to be approximately $700 million. However, as we highlighted last quarter, this is an annualized estimate and the reduction may be partially offset by higher levels of activity, and we will observe how customers respond to the new features that will be introduced in the latter part of the year. Home lending revenue declined 33% from a year ago and 19% from the fourth quarter, driven by lower mortgage originations and press margins, given the higher rate environment and competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry. Mortgage rates increased 156 basis points in the first quarter and are above rate levels observed for the most of the last -- for most of the last decade. Reflecting this environment, we expect second quarter originations and margins to remain under pressure and mortgage banking revenue to continue to decline. We\u2019ve started to reduce expenses in response to the decline in volume and expect expenses will continue to decline throughout the year as excess capacity is removed and aligned to lower business activity. Credit card revenue was up 6% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and point-of-sale volumes. Auto revenue increased 10% and personal lending was up 2% from a year ago, primarily due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on slide 10. Our mortgage originations declined 21% from the fourth quarter. We believe the mortgage market experienced its largest quarterly decline since 2003, primarily due to lower refinance activity in response to higher mortgage rates. Home lending loan balances grew modestly from the fourth quarter, driven by the third consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio, which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs. Turning to auto. Origination volume increased 4% from a year ago, but was down 22% from fourth quarter due to credit tightening in higher risk segments and increased price competition as interest rates rose, and we targeted solid returns for new originations. Turning to debit card. Transactions declined 7% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality and were up 3% from a year ago with double-digit growth in travel and entertainment. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume continued to be strong. It was up 33% from a year ago, but down 5% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality. While payment rates remain elevated, balances grew 14% from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products. New credit card accounts increased over 80% from a year ago, and we continue to be pleased by the quality of the accounts we\u2019re attracting. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 11. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher deposit and loan balances as well as the impact of higher interest rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances, stronger net gains from equity securities and higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Noninterest expense declined 6% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower personnel and occupancy expense due to efficiency initiatives and lower lease expense. After declining during the first half of last year, average loan balances have grown for 3 consecutive quarters and were up 6% from a year ago. Revolver utilization rates have increased but are still well below historical levels. Loan demand has been driven by larger clients who are increasing borrowing due to the impact of inflation on material and transportation costs as well as to support inventory growth. We\u2019re also seeing new demand from some clients who are catching up from underinvestment in projects and capital expenditures over the past couple of years. Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 12. Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher loan balances and improved treasury management results. Average loan balances were up 18% from a year ago with increased demand across most industries driven primarily by capital expenditures and growing working capital needs. Commercial real estate revenue grew 9% from a year ago, driven by the higher loan balances and higher revenue in our low-income housing business. Average loan balances were up 17% from a year ago, and originations in the first quarter outpaced volumes from a year ago and loan pipelines continue to be strong. Markets revenue was down 18% from a year ago, primarily due to lower trading activity in residential mortgage-backed securities and high-yield products. Average deposits in corporate investment banking were down $25.3 billion or 13% from a year ago, driven by continued actions to manage into the asset cap. On slide 13, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 6% from a year ago, driven by higher asset-based fees on higher market valuations and higher net interest income from the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher deposit and loan balances. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter. So first quarter results reflected market valuations as of Jan 1, and second quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of April 1. The 5% increase in expenses from a year ago was primarily driven by higher revenue-related compensation, which was more than offset by higher revenue. Average deposits were up 7% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Slide 14 highlights our corporate results, both revenue and expenses declined from a year ago, driven by the sale of our student loan portfolio and divestitures of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $791 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2021, including the gain on sale of our student loan portfolio and they accounted for approximately $400 million of the decline in expenses compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-down on the sale of our student loan portfolio. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Scott Siefers : Mike, I appreciate the commentary on reiterating the expense guidance for the full year. I was just hoping, given sort of the lumpiness between the seasonality and the account expenses and then some of the operating losses. If you could maybe give a little bit more of a fine point on the trajectory. In other words, how much could we -- or should we expect things to come down in the second quarter? And then, is it going to be just a progressive decline through the end of the year, or how will things ebb and flow in your mind? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Great. Thanks, Scott. As I said in the remarks, we had about $600 million of seasonal expenses in there related to 401(k) and stock comp and all the associated stuff in the first quarter. So, that starts to fall away. And then, obviously, the other piece in there that I mentioned was operating losses, and that can be a little lumpy as you go throughout the year. But when you sort of take a step back, as you saw last year as well, as we execute our efficiency initiatives, you generally don\u2019t get all those benefits starting day one. And so, you\u2019ll continue to get more and more impact throughout the year. So, you should expect the expense trajectory to be down as we go throughout the year. Now, every quarter may not be down in a linear way, but nonetheless, you\u2019ll see a trend downward. And just to reinforce what we said in the remarks, we did -- we still believe the $51.5 billion for the full year is achievable despite the fact that we had the higher operating losses in the quarter. And then I\u2019ll just reiterate the other piece of guidance we gave on NII. We do think -- as we said in January, we thought NII would be up about 8%. So, we\u2019re almost doubling that to kind of the mid-teens as we look throughout the year, both given -- due to the loan growth we\u2019ve seen and as well as the substantial move in rates. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Thank you. And then just maybe to follow up. I think you guys talked in the past about an expectation for expenses to decline next year as well. Just given how lasting some of these inflationary pressures seem to be, do you see any risk to that outlook of another down year in costs next year? Charlie Scharf : It\u2019s Charlie. I would say a couple of things. I think it\u2019s still the way we think about the way we want to plan for the year, for sure, as we sit here today. On inflationary pressures, I would say, and it\u2019s still early and still thinking -- things will still continue to evolve, but our own experience here is that the wage pressures that we\u2019ve seen today are not as great as they were in the fourth quarter of last year. So they still exist, but they do seem to be slowing. And obviously, the Fed is going to, as I said, going to do everything they can to bring that down. And so, as we sit here today, by the time we get to the next year, I think we\u2019ll be in a very, very different position relative to where inflation is. And so, we\u2019re still very focused on - use the word efficiency, but we\u2019re really focused on running the place better. And that\u2019s what these expense reductions actually result in. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, wanted to just start off with a question on NII and excess liquidity deployment. Specifically, I was hoping you could speak to your appetite to deploy some of the excess liquidity that you guys still retain. And where reinvestment yields are currently just given spread widening in MBS in particular? And what securities you might look to purchase, given some of the sensitivities on the duration side? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Thanks, Steve. It\u2019s Mike. Look, first, when it comes to deploying liquidity, it\u2019s going to be loans first, right? So, if you think about the waterfall. And so, as we see more loan growth, that\u2019s where it\u2019s going to go first. And obviously, that\u2019s the preferred path anyway. And then, based on what we see there, we will decide if we\u2019re going to grow the securities portfolio throughout the year. I would say, our -- the guidance we gave for NII does not assume that we grow the portfolio in any substantial way. And so, that will -- we\u2019ll have to see how that goes based on what we see from a loan growth perspective. And then, you can see where yields are across both, treasuries and MBS, which are the two primary asset classes we have in the portfolio. And I think, obviously, we\u2019re now investing at higher rates than we\u2019ve seen certainly in a while, and that\u2019s additive as we go forward. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just one follow-up relating to deposit beta specifically, certainly a big area of focus given the more aggressive pace of Fed tightening as well as QT, I was hoping you can just speak to your relative stickiness of your deposit base versus last cycle, given the liability optimization, you guys have been executing under the asset cap for a number of years now. And is there a credible case in your view that deposit betas could in fact be lower this cycle, just given some of that favorable deposit remixing? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No, I think you highlighted the right point. As you look at what we\u2019ve had to do over the last couple of years to manage on the asset cap, we\u2019ve really pushed away some of our most interest rate-sensitive deposits during that time. And so, we\u2019ve seen the least rate-sensitive deposits on the retail side and the consumer side grow as a percentage of the overall deposit base. And so, that\u2019s definitely going to help lower the average betas that we\u2019ll see relative to what we saw in the last cycle. I think, our expectations as you sort of think about the different slices of the deposit base haven\u2019t really changed much over the last couple of months. I think as we look at the first 100 basis points, we don\u2019t think deposit rates are going to move that much, which is pretty similar to what we saw last go around. And then I think on the consumer side, you\u2019ll have slower betas and you\u2019ll have higher betas on the wholesale side. But likely, given our position, we\u2019ll lag a little bit on pricing given the asset cap and what we\u2019ve got to do to continue to manage that. Charlie Scharf : And this is Charlie. The only thing I would add is that I think a lot of it also has to -- also depends on what the other alternatives for folks that are out there certainly on the consumer side. And when you look at the environment that we\u2019re heading into and the volatility that we\u2019ll see, I just -- I think that\u2019s a very different kind of environment than if you\u2019re in a very stable market, and rates are just moving up relatively slowly. So, I think it is different in that respect as well. Steven Chubak : All right. That\u2019s great. If I could just squeeze in one more quick one. Would just be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask about -- given some of the fee income commentary that you guys have highlighted, particularly some of the headwinds on both mortgage as well as wealth management, how we should be thinking about the right jumping off point for 2Q fee income, just given a lot of volatility in a few of those line items in the quarter? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I\u2019ll give you a couple of points there. So, as you think about the advisory assets, if you look at what\u2019s happened in both the fixed income and equity markets in terms of the valuation at the 3/ 31 being down, I think, roughly 5% or 6% is probably not a bad place to start the modeling on advisory assets, given the fact that a large chunk of them are built in advance based on that value. On the mortgage business, we will see a step down, given the pretty abrupt slowdown in the refinance market, in particular. We still expect to have decent volumes in the purchase market, but spreads will definitely -- or gain on sale margins will definitely be impacted given there\u2019s still a lot of excess capacity in the system. Now, I would just keep that in context of the backdrop that we laid out in terms of the growth and NII as you look through the rest of the year. So, even if you start to see a little bit of pressure on those line items, the growth in NII will position us pretty well throughout the rest of the year. Charlie Scharf : Yes. And this is Charlie. And the only thing I would just add to that. I think when you think about how we are -- and I kind of said this in the quote and in my remarks, the way we\u2019re positioned going into an environment like this is we feel very positive about where we stand. And mortgage banking income is going to decline because rates are going up, and we\u2019re going to make much more on the increase in rates than we will on the decline in mortgage banking income. We\u2019re continuing to focus on reducing expenses. Credit is still exceptionally good and certainly will be into the next quarter, based on everything that we see and possibly beyond, even though at one point, they will go up. And so, while we\u2019re not sure what the overall economic environment will look like, that doesn\u2019t change our point of view on the fact that we\u2019re well positioned for it. Mike Santomassimo : Just a reminder, I said in my script, Steve, too, on the impact of the reduction in nonsufficient fund balance fees and some of the overdraft changes we made, you\u2019ll start to see the impact of that in the second quarter as well. Operator : The next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the expense side, I appreciate you helping us out with the $51.5 billion in terms of the reiteration of the guide. On the operating loss side, how do you feel about that $1.3 billion expectation, given the pressure on the number in the quarter? And then separately, I guess, also on the cost savings, I wanted to see how you\u2019re feeling about the $3.3 billion in gross saves and $1.6 billion net, any changes to that expectation? Thanks. Charlie Scharf : So, I\u2019ll just -- I\u2019ll take the first part Mike, you maybe take the second. On the first one, the things that we saw in the first quarter are very specific to remediations. And so, what we saw in the first quarter really has nothing to do with what we\u2019ll see in the next series of quarters. And so, those kind of stand on their own and it\u2019s not something that gets built on from there. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And as you look at the efficiency, and I think hopefully, this was implied in what we -- the guidance we gave, but we\u2019re executing well on the efficiency program that we\u2019ve got. And as I said a number of times over the last couple of quarters, it\u2019s not a -- it\u2019s not a static program, like this is something that we\u2019re embedding in the DNA of how we run the place and it continues to evolve, and we feel good about executing on that. John Pancari : Okay. And then, on the capital side, I know the CET1 decline of 90 basis points this quarter. You also mentioned the SCB surcharge could increase. You did flag the lower levels of buyback expected for the second quarter. Maybe can you talk about your thoughts on capital return beyond the second quarter, just given how things are shaping up and your earnings outlook? I just wonder if you have updated thoughts there. Thanks. Charlie Scharf : Yes, I\u2019ll start, Mike, and then you can chime in. I think what we\u2019re just trying to do is just -- it\u2019s -- we do have the reality of the impact on OCI during the quarter. And so, you see where CET1 is. Our quarter -- our dividend is about $1 billion a quarter or so. So, we do have plenty of room inside there for any other further changes to OCI or the ability for us to grow RWA, which we want to do as loan growth continues to show the demand that we\u2019re seeing. And so, I think just where we are specifically in the second quarter will depend on where rates come out. And then beyond that, we\u2019ll still -- obviously, we\u2019re going through CCAR, but we still should have capacity to figure out what we want to do with the excess capital that the Company generates. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And as earnings capacity grows, as NII grows and we go through the year, we execute on our efficiency program, there\u2019s -- and we\u2019re still operating under the asset cap, you -- there\u2019s -- I think you\u2019ll see us be prudent, but we\u2019ve got plenty of flexibility as we look through the rest of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Ken Usdin : Just a couple of follow-ups on the cost side. So, Mike, the business sales from last year and kind of the stranded costs and the transition agreements, can you walk us through again how much of that was in the first quarter? And then, how does that kind of decline? And is that also built into your full year expectation for the cost numbers? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. So, what we said, Ken, as you look at the first quarter, is about $400 million of expenses fell away in the quarter as the business exited. And the remainder -- and so about $300 million of that was from the ongoing run rate of the businesses, about $100 million was a charge we took last year for the student loan business. And the remainder falls either under the TSAs, which are in place today and likely run most of the year, if not into early next year. But remember, there\u2019s revenue on the other side of that. And then, you have the stranded costs. So, the numbers we laid out at the end of the fourth quarter last year are -- haven\u2019t changed. And as the TSAs roll off, we\u2019ll do our best to highlight that if it\u2019s meaningful. And then, we\u2019re going to continue to work on the stranded costs and get them out, but that will take a little bit of time, as we said last quarter. Ken Usdin : Right. Okay. And then, just two little things on net interest income. You did mention that you had the EPBO sales this quarter and I think related lower net interest income, plus you did show the decline in premium am. And I\u2019m wondering if you can just help us understand how much the EPBO sales took out of NII? And are you still expecting those to go out through the year? And then, how do you expect premium am to trend from here? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And the combo of PPP loans and EPBOs came down sequentially or linked quarter about $178 million, and that was the impact on revenue there on NII. And so -- and we\u2019ll reiterate that in the Q when it comes out. As you look at premium am or for mortgage-backed, you can look at the slide for reference when you have time. I know it\u2019s a busy day today. But, it came down roughly a little over $100 million, $110 million, $15 million decline in the quarter. And that will continue to decline as prepay slow throughout the year. So, it\u2019s come down quite a bit since where we were last year. Operator : The next question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Just on the fee income front, you made a couple of comments already about the core fee line. What about some of the more volatile lines on the capital markets side? I think, the venture capital came in a little bit better than expected in a tough market this quarter. What should we be thinking about in terms of investment banking, trading and maybe the Norwest Venture line? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. As you know, predicting investment banking fees and market fees is fraught with lots of issues. But I think, look, the -- it\u2019s clear that on the investment banking side, some of the capital markets, particularly on the equity side, has slowed quite a bit this year, given some of the volatility we\u2019ve seen. Our pipeline really hasn\u2019t change much. It\u2019s still pretty strong from where we stand coming into the quarter. And so, some of that realization of that pipeline is just somewhat market-dependent and dependent on some deals, timing of some of the deals closing. So, we\u2019ll see. The markets revenue is somewhat dependent on the volatility that we see and the demand we see. And so, I think as others have gone through this, we\u2019ll benefit from some of that as we go through it. But that\u2019s hard to predict exactly where we\u2019ll end up. And then, on Norwest Venture, look, if you go back a number of years and you look at there\u2019s some number -- there\u2019s some like stability to that line when you look at over the last three or four years. I think when you look at some of what happened this quarter, we did have a bunch of realized, like business being sold or going public in one or two cases of some of the investments. And so, that was really good to see that that\u2019s still continuing despite some of the market volatility. And I think we\u2019ll see how it goes. I think we won\u2019t -- it\u2019s hard to imagine we\u2019ll see some of the peaks that we saw last year in that revenue line item. But I do expect we\u2019ll continue to see some good performance across those businesses. John McDonald : And also on the NII, any comments you could make about your expectations for the cadence of the NII improvement throughout the year and maybe a little bit of what you\u2019re baking in on premium am and maybe how much benefit you get from -- on a spot basis, like a hike of 25 or 50 bps, just any framework there? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No. So, a lot of it\u2019s going to be dependent on how fast the Fed moves. And as you know, when the Fed moves, the impact of that is immediate, you start realizing that the day after. And so, obviously, those expectations there have changed quite a bit. So, that will be the case. I think in the Q, we give you the shock numbers on 100 basis-point moves. And those are pretty close to what you should expect for the first few rate rises in terms of the impact. And again, it\u2019s pretty immediate for the most of it. John McDonald : And the premium am, Mike, you assume that that comes down throughout the year? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. It has to, yes. I mean, absolutely. It will continue to come down as we see rates go up and prepay slow, sorry about that. But yes, I think you\u2019ll start to see that come down. Will it -- I think it will be -- it\u2019s a little bit dependent upon again how things progress, but it\u2019s not unreasonable to think as we look at the next quarter that it\u2019s somewhere in the ballpark of what we saw from -- on a linked quarter basis this quarter. John McDonald : Got it. I guess, I was wondering, did you improve the assumptions for that? Is that part of the NII upgrade, or is that more just rates kind of -- okay. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. That\u2019s baked into the increase in NII that we gave, John. Operator : The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess, first question, Charlie, you\u2019ve, in the past, talked about the 15% ROTCE as needing the asset capital lift and some level of higher rates. We\u2019re getting a lot more in terms of higher rates than we expected six months ago. Just doing rough math in terms of how you\u2019ve talked about expense outlook, mid-teens NII growth. Do you think it\u2019s conceivable that we hit 15% ROTCE at some point over the next four to six quarters, even without the asset cap being lifted? Charlie Scharf : I don\u2019t want to talk about a time frame yet because I think what we\u2019ve consistently said and will stick to that is we\u2019ll get to 10%, and then we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about the 15% and try and hone a little bit more on timing. But I do think it is fair to assume that the rate rises that we\u2019re seeing are more than we would have thought was necessary to get to 15%. But so, I think the question of the asset cap not still being with us. I think that\u2019s just -- that is the reality. And so, it\u2019s quite possible that the rate rises will be more of a benefit than we would have hoped in terms of offsetting that. But I just can\u2019t -- I think we should just wait until we get to 10%. But certainly, these rate rises that we\u2019re seeing and the asset sensitivity that we have are certainly a meaningful positive for us and more than we would have expected. Ebrahim Poonawala : I appreciate that response. And just one quick question on credit, Mike. When we think about another quarter of sizable reserve release, we\u2019ve seen one of your peers yesterday build reserves, talking about just putting a higher weight on a stress case scenario. Give us a sense in terms of your outlook for the economy and how that leads to loan loss reserves, where they are today versus I think your day one CECL was about 95 basis points. Just any thought process around how you\u2019re thinking through that would be helpful. Charlie Scharf : Yes. This is Charlie. I\u2019ll take a stab at it first. I think it\u2019s -- I think understanding what\u2019s in our CECL assumptions is something which is important. As hard as it is to predict, it does give you a sense for how we\u2019re thinking about things and how our loan book and other items play out in that reserving calculation. But it is very hard to compare across companies because we have different scenarios. We put different profitabilities on different things. And the way -- the conservatism in models is different across companies. I think what we\u2019ve seen consistently in our reserving levels as we\u2019ve been on the more conservative side relative to others, that might just be a view of a more conservative set of assumptions or something which is embedded in our models or the way we think about just the potential impacts of COVID, and now the potential impacts of a slowing economy. So, I would say, overall, I don\u2019t -- sitting here today, if you were to look at our -- the way we look at the assumptions that go into it, I think we were already assuming a reasonable percentage of probability on the downside. And so, that hasn\u2019t changed, but we feel better about some of the assumptions we made relative to COVID, and we\u2019ve added some assumptions relative to inflation. So, I think net-net-net, that\u2019s what drives the reduction in terms of where we are. And I still think we\u2019re -- we feel very comfortable and hopefully are at the more conservative end of what can come out of a CECL calculation. Ebrahim Poonawala : That\u2019s helpful. And should we then still assume that the reserves probably track lower over the next few quarters, at least absent a big change in the macro? Charlie Scharf : Yes. I think it\u2019s all dependent on macro at this point. CECL requires you to take a look at -- based upon what -- the full amount of the losses embedded in the portfolio relative to what you see as the macroeconomic outlook and the specific performance. So, by outlook, it gets better, reserves will come down. If it gets worse, we\u2019ll go up. And if it stays the same, it will be along there. Operator : The next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I had another semi technical question here. But on the NII outlook, I get your point that you should see improvement pretty near term from the rate environment. I\u2019m just thinking about what you put in your release for the yields on loans where at least this quarter, loan yields came down a bit. Now, I know part of that\u2019s probably day count, but we saw some declines in resi mortgage on first and second lien and also on the auto side. And I just wanted to get a sense -- and also in C&I, right? So I just wanted to get a sense what was playing into that Q-on-Q? And then, how quickly that could revert as we go through this year? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Hey Betsy, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll try to take a shot at that. I think on the resi mortgage side, what you\u2019re seeing is the impact of the EPBO loans and so they\u2019re coming -- they impacted us coming down. So, that creates a little bit of noise, I think, there relative to the yield there. If you look at the rest of the -- on the C&I book, I\u2019m going to get the directionally the percentage. But it\u2019s, call it, two-thirds of the C&I book, in that neighborhood is floating rate, maybe plus or minus a little bit there, but the -- and so that starts to react pretty -- obviously direct pretty quickly to rates moving. And in any given quarter, you see a little bit of noise on that yield, but you\u2019ll start to see that react as rates go up. Betsy Graseck : Okay. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s hedged out, and that\u2019s why we saw what we saw Q-Q Mike Santomassimo : No. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then the other message I\u2019m getting from you this morning is that this rate improvement you\u2019re expecting to drop to the bottom line, is that fair? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I think we reiterated our expense guidance for the year, and NII is going to be a lot better. Charlie Scharf : Betsy, what\u2019s in your question? I\u2019m not sure I understand. Betsy Graseck : Well, you\u2019re getting an uptick in rates. And given the fact that your guidance on expenses is holding steady, it seems like you\u2019re going to drop all that rate hike to the bottom line. Charlie Scharf : Well, I mean, yes, we\u2019re going to make more money on NII. We -- Mike went through the specifics on how noninterest income will likely come down, but not -- obviously not nearly as much as the benefit that we\u2019ll get as you look out over NII. And charge-offs still will remain at low levels for the foreseeable future, even though those will go up at some point. And yes, expenses will continue to come down for us to meet the 51.5 number. Betsy Graseck : Yes. I mean, it feels like it\u2019s at least a mid-singles uptick on consensus EPS. That\u2019s what it feels like to me, at least. But I mean I know if you drop all the NII to the bottom line, I get something closer to high-singles uptick on consensus EPS, but\u2026 Charlie Scharf : I\u2019ll just make sure you look at -- I mean, I try to lay out a little bit of what\u2019s going to happen on noninterest income. I think charge-offs are at all-time lows. You see the delinquency numbers. So, unless there\u2019s something on the commercial side or the wholesale side that we\u2019re not aware of, it\u2019s -- we feel -- it\u2019s one of -- when we talk about how we feel, I think it\u2019s -- the economy is the economy. We are positioned well for this kind of environment. But we also think people should just make sure that they\u2019re conscious of the movement in all the line items. Betsy Graseck : And then, on the customer remediation charge that you took this quarter, I guess that\u2019s the other kind of question that I\u2019ve been getting is it\u2019s one-timey, but it feels like it\u2019s happened a lot. So, how much more is left? Charlie Scharf : It\u2019s really hard to answer, and I understand the frustration. And I would say, every quarter, we go through this, we say we want to make sure that we\u2019ve got everything. But we are -- we have to make sure that when we look at these remediations, they\u2019re aligned with what makes sense for the customer and that we\u2019ve captured all the portfolios. And some of our -- some of these remediations required us to go back and recreate a scenario from 10, 15 years ago. And so, that\u2019s part of the complication that we see. And so, we\u2019re not going to say that there\u2019s no more, but they\u2019re very case specific. And at some point, they will be behind us, but we have to do what we have to do. And at least in the big scheme of things relative to the benefits that we\u2019ll see from things like NII, these aren\u2019t overwhelming. And we understand how this fits into the guidance that we\u2019ve given on full-year expenses. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: I guess, just following up on the regulatory line of questions. And as usual, I got to ask some questions that are tough to answer. But you\u2019ve acknowledged you\u2019re making significant progress. The regulators have acknowledged you\u2019re making significant progress. The fundamentals are clearly moving in the right direction in a meaningful way. But in the prepared remarks, you still say you need to continue to close these gaps over the next several years? And I guess, the question is, -- like is this just cautionary language? Or are there still things that you are implementing on kind of a daily and ongoing basis to address some of the legacy issues. I guess I thought you had implemented kind of the fixes and it\u2019s kind of the oversight and execution situation. But maybe you could just talk to that. Charlie Scharf : Yes. I don\u2019t recall saying the words that you just used. I think we have been trying to be very clear that we have a lot of ongoing work to do that we feel very good about the frameworks that we have in place. But we are -- as you -- once you develop the framework, the implementation of the frameworks takes a significant amount of time. We continue to do that. And as we develop stronger controls inside the company, we will potentially find things that then have to get fixed and remediated because this is many years of work that we\u2019re doing at this point. And as the regulators look at the amount of time that it takes to do it at the things that we find, as we put these controls in place and just some of these legacy things that continue to remain out there, I just think it\u2019s prudent that we expect to have things I think we say it\u2019s possible or likely. But if there was something specific we would say, but I think it is -- that\u2019s just -- that\u2019s the reality of the situation that we\u2019re in. And so, it is -- where we find ourselves is -- and I\u2019ll speak for ourselves, not the regulators. We are -- have made significant progress from where we were when we got here, but there is still a significant amount of more work to do. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then, just a follow-up on a different topic. And I apologize if I missed it. But you did talk about slowing buybacks in the second quarter, partly rates, partly loans. And obviously, you bought back a lot this quarter. Did you give the magnitude that you expect to buy back or remind us your targeted capital at least until the next CCAR comes out? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Matt, I\u2019ll take that. As we\u2019ve said a few times in the past, we plan to run the CET1 ratio at somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points over our reg minimum, which right now is 9.1%. And I think as we look forward, given the way the framework works is we\u2019ll have plenty of flexibility to do what we think is prudent on buybacks as we go throughout the rest of the year. Operator : The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Erika Najarian : My questions have been asked and answered. Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. Charles Peabody : Most of my questions have been asked. But let me ask one question about how you manage your mortgage banking operation because you\u2019re one of the few large banks that still has a relatively balanced origination and servicing side. Historically, servicing was kind of viewed as a balance to origination. When originations didn\u2019t do well, servicing would do well. But that hasn\u2019t been the case recently in your recent history. And so, can you talk about how you\u2019re managing it and why there isn\u2019t a balance to those two pieces? Charlie Scharf : Yes, I\u2019ll start, this is Charlie, Mike, and then you can pipe in. I think we think about our mortgage business in the context of the whole company, not as a separate, independent entity that has to stand by itself. And so, when we think about the interest rate risk position of the entire company, that\u2019s where we think about what potentially happens on the production side versus what happens in the MSR. The management of the MSR is difficult. It\u2019s got some very different types of risks embedded in it. And all you did was look at those 2 as offsets, you could be kidding yourselves as to what the value of the servicing is. And so as I said, net-net-net, when we look at the position of the company, I would look at the reduction of mortgage banking income not being offset by the MSR, but being offset by the rest of the benefit that will get as a company NII. Charles Peabody : And just as a follow-up, when you gave guidance about a material step down in mortgage banking in the second quarter, were you talking strictly on the origination side or as a whole entity? Mike Santomassimo : As a whole, think of the mortgage banking income line as what we\u2019re referring to. Charlie Scharf : And remember, included in there is the fact that the MSR is fairly well hedged. So, it\u2019s basically -- it\u2019s the whole, but it\u2019s also -- what\u2019s really driving it is origination. Operator : Our final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Charlie, you both referenced in your comments about the excess capacity in mortgage banking and you\u2019re anticipating or waiting for some of that excess capacity to come out as originations of course, for the industry have come down to higher rates. What are some of the metrics you guys are monitoring and keeping an eye on to show you that that capacity is coming out of the system? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I think, as you think about the industry as a whole, it\u2019s hard, Gerard, to look at any specific metrics per se. But I think where you\u2019re going to see that first is likely gain on sale margins as people start to normalize as excess capacity comes out, right? So, I think that\u2019s probably one of the areas I would look at. Charlie Scharf : Yes. And listen, I mean, people just -- everyone in the industry looks around it. The amount of volume being down substantially, they look at the amount of expense that they have. People then rationalize the expense that they have and that naturally changes the competitive dynamics about where people are pricing. So, we\u2019re focused on making sure that we\u2019ve got the right level of expense relative to the revenue and volume that we\u2019re seeing, and that\u2019s exactly what everyone else does. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And Mike, just following up on your gain on sale and margin -- gain on sale margins, what would you consider normal? And where are they for you guys today? Mike Santomassimo : Well, we don\u2019t disclose the margin itself as you sort of look forward. But normal varies, right, as you sort of look through the cycle in the mortgage business. And so, I think we\u2019re certainly -- if you start thinking about primary, secondary spreads, that\u2019s one indicator of sort of where gain on sale margins will go, I think. And we\u2019re now back to what is likely more historical levels right around 100 basis points or so when you look at that. And that\u2019s -- so I think you\u2019re kind of back to a more normal level there. And then, I think as excess capacity goes out, like you\u2019ll start to see the gain on sale come back up. So, I think it\u2019s hard to say exactly what normal will look like there as we go through the cycle. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then, just as a follow-up question. Mike, you alluded to the possibility that the stress capital buffer following this year CCAR could be a little higher for you folks. Is there -- can you give us some color what is making you think that way? Mike Santomassimo : It\u2019s just the severity of the variables that went into it, Gerard. And obviously, it\u2019s a bit of a black box in terms of what -- exactly what the answer is. And so, we do our best to try to look at like how that might impact us and how the Fed might look at it. But, it\u2019s really based on the severity of the scenario that played through. Gerard Cassidy : Great, always appreciate the color. Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : I appreciate it. And I think that\u2019s the last question. So, we know it\u2019s a really busy day for everyone. So, we thank you for spending the time, and we\u2019ll talk soon.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thanks very much, John. Good morning. I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results, the operating environment, and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some second quarter highlights. We earned $3.1 billion in the second quarter, our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to market conditions. Revenue declined as growth in net interest income driven by rising interest rates and higher loan balances was more than offset by lower non-interest income as market conditions negatively impacted our venture capital, mortgage banking, investment banking, and wealth management advisory businesses. We continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives and our expenses declined from a year ago even with inflationary pressures and higher operating losses. We had broad-based loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the first quarter and a year ago. Credit performance remained strong, our allowance reflected an increase due to loan growth. While we're monitoring risks related to continued high inflation, increasing interest rates, and the slowing economy, which will impact our customers, consumers and businesses have been resilient so far. When looking at simple averages across our entire portfolio, consumer deposit balances per account increased from first quarter and a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels. Overall, our consumer deposit customers' health indicators, including cash flow, payroll, and overdraft trends are not showing elevated risk concerns. However, we're closely monitoring activity by segment for signs of potential stress and for certain cohorts of customers, we have seen average balances steadily decline to pre-pandemic levels following the final federal stimulus payments early last year and their debit card spend has also been declining. Overall, debit card spending was up 3% compared to a year ago when consumers receive stimulus payments and inflation appears to be impacting certain categories of spending, including a 26% increase in fuel driven by higher prices, while discretionary categories like apparel and home improvement spending were down double digits, driven by fewer transactions. Credit card spend increased 28% from a year ago. Above the industry trend driven by the new products we launched last year, with double-digit increases across all spend categories. However, spending while still strong, started to slow in May and June. Consumer credit card utilization rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. Payment rates remained strong and delinquency rates remain low. Our small business portfolio continues to perform well in the aggregate in both delinquencies and losses. Leading indicators such as payment rates, deposit levels, utilization and revolving debt trends do not yet indicate signs of stress. Loan demand from our commercial customers remained strong with broad-based balance and commitment growth. Our commercial customers' credit performance remained strong with exceptionally low net charge-offs and non-accrual loans were at their lowest level in over 10 years. However, we are monitoring early warning indicators across portfolios including cash flow activity, credit line utilization rates and industry fundamentals for inflation impacts.  Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Our work to build an appropriate risk and control infrastructure is ongoing and remains our top priority, but we also continue to invest in our businesses to better serve our customers and to help drive growth. This week, we launched our fourth new credit card offering in the past year, Wells Fargo Autograph. Our latest card reflects our momentum in growing our consumer credit card business with new accounts up over 60% from a year ago. We're focused on delivering competitive offerings and our new reward card provides three times points across top spending categories including restaurants, travel and gas stations. This is the first of several rewards based cards we plan to introduce. We continue to improve the digital experience in the second quarter with the relaunch of Intuitive Investor, our automated digital investing platform. We simplified the account opening process and created a faster and better experience for both new and experienced investors. During the second quarter, we began rolling out Wells Fargo Premier, which provides differentiated products and experiences focused on strengthening and growing our affluent client relationships. We are working towards offering one set of products and services that are tailored to the needs of these customers regardless of where they sit within our individual businesses. We will be rolling out more enhancements in the coming quarters to provide a more compelling offering for Premier clients. We started to roll out overdraft policy changes late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions. Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, including providing customers who overdraw their account with a 25-hour grace period to cure a negative balance before incurring an overdraft fee, giving early access to eligible direct deposits and providing a new easy short-term credit product. We expect these changes will help millions of consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs, and we continue to review other ways we can help consumers manage their finances. We also continue to invest to better serve our commercial customers. And early in the second quarter, Tim O'Hara joined the Corporate Investment Bank from BlackRock as Head of Banking. Tim's expertise and insights will help us maximize our potential and achieve even greater partnership and strategic dialogue with our corporate and institutional clients, and he complements the strong leadership team in our markets and commercial real estate businesses, who have helped us navigate recent market volatility. We believe we have a significant opportunity to serve our existing commercial customers with corporate and investment banking products in a way that works within our existing risk tolerance. We also believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. Last week, we announced that Otis Rolley will be joining Wells Fargo from the Rockefeller Foundation as the Head of Social Impact, leading community engagement and enterprise philanthropy, including the Wells Fargo Foundation. We continue to move forward in the area of ESG with the announcement of our 2030 reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to financing activities in the oil and gas and power sectors. As homeownership remains out of reach for too many families, we announced an effort to support new home construction, renovation and repair of more than 450 affordable homes across the US in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity and Rebuilding Together. We also launched our special purpose credit program to help minority homeowners refinance mortgages that Wells Fargo currently services. We continue to support our small business customers through this time of uncertainty, including launching the small business resource Navigator, which connects small business owners to potential financing options and technical assistance through community development financial institutions across the country. We are also helping women entrepreneurs by doubling our support for women-owned businesses through the Connect to More program with complementary mentorship opportunities. We published our inaugural diversity, equity and inclusion report, which highlights the meaningful positive results we've made on our DE&I initiatives. For example, in the US, our external hiring of individuals from racially or ethnically diverse populations increased by 27% in 2021 compared to 2020, and approximately one-third of all internally promoted executives last year were racially or ethnically diverse. As I've said in the past, advancing DE&I at Wells Fargo is a long-term commitment, not a project and we continue to pursue many of the initiatives in the report and look for ways to deepen our impact. Let me just make some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. The Federal Reserve's commitment to an aggressive rate hike cycle as a means to tame high persistent inflation continues to fuel market volatility and is expected to slow the economy, which will impact our consumer and commercial customers. Despite the economic environment, I remain optimistic about our future. Credit quality remains strong, and we expect net interest income growth to continue given rising interest rates which should more than offset any further near-term pressure on non-interest income. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past, on a run rate basis in the second half of this year, and then we will discuss our path to 15%. This year's Federal Reserve stress test confirmed our strong capital position and our ability to support our customers and communities while also continuing to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share, subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.1 billion or $0.74 per common share, which included strong growth in net interest income as we are beginning to see the positive impact of higher interest rates. Our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to the market conditions, which drove a total loss from equity securities of $615 million in the second quarter. Recall that a year ago, when the markets were strong, our results included $2.7 billion of gains on equity securities. While credit quality remains strong, our results included a $235 million increase in the allowance for credit losses due to loan growth, this follows six consecutive quarterly decreases in the allowance, including $1.1 billion in the first quarter and $1.6 billion a year ago. We highlight capital on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, down approximately 20 basis points from the first quarter as declines in AOCI and dividend payments were largely offset by our second quarter earnings. Our CET1 ratio also reflected actions we took to proactively manage our level of capital and risk-weighted assets as well as reduce our AOCI sensitivity by moving more securities the held to maturity and hedging securities in our available-for-sale portfolio. Additionally, we did not buy back any shares in the second quarter. But as Charlie highlighted, the recent stress test results confirmed our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. We will continue to be prudent and consider current market conditions, including interest rate volatility, potential loan and risk-weighted asset growth as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters. Our 10.3% CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers. As a reminder, based on the recent federal stress test, our stressed capital buffer for October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 is expected to be 3.2%, which would increase our regulatory minimum plus buffers by 10 basis points to 9.2%. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our charge-off ratio remained near historical lows and was only 15 basis points in the second quarter. As we previously discussed, losses are not expected to remain at these low levels and we are closely monitoring our commercial and consumer customers for signs of stress, and we remain very disciplined in our underwriting. Commercial credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses with only 2 basis points of net charge-offs in the second quarter, which included net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio. We also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios and total consumer net charge-offs declined slightly from the first quarter to 33 basis points of average loans as lower losses in auto and other consumer loans were partially offset by higher credit card losses. Non-performing assets decreased $878 million or 13% from the first quarter. Lower levels of consumer non-accruals were driven by a decline in residential mortgage non-accrual loans due to sustained payment performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Commercial non-accruals continued to decline, and as Charlie highlighted, we are at their lowest levels in over 10 years. Our allowance for credit losses at the end of the second quarter reflected a continued strong credit performance, with an increase that was due to loan growth. On slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 3% for the first quarter. Period end loans grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and were up 11% from a year ago, with increases in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth ogres when discussing operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 19 basis points from a year ago and 27 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher rates. Average deposits increased $10 billion or 1% from a year ago, with growth in consumer banking and lending, offsetting declines across our other operating segments. The decline in average deposits from the first quarter reflected seasonality of tax payments as well as outflows from commercial and wealth clients. Our average deposit cost increased one basis point from the first quarter, driven by corporate and investment banking. As I previously highlighted, we would expect deposit betas to accelerate as rates continue to rise and customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products would likely increase as well. Turning to net interest income on slide 7. Second quarter net interest income increased $1.4 billion or 16% from a year ago and $977 million or 11% from the first quarter. The growth from the first quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgage backed securities, we also benefit from higher loan balances and one additional day in the quarter. We started the year expecting full year net interest income to grow by approximately 8% compared with 2021. Last quarter, we raised our guidance to an increase in the mid-teens. With the market now expecting not only more rate hikes but also larger ones, we currently expect net interest income in 2022 to increase approximately 20% from 2021. And as a reminder, net interest income will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas and loan growth. On slide 8 and noninterest income. This quarter, noninterest income -- this quarter, we included highlighting noninterest income to show that the decline from both the first quarter and a year ago was primarily driven by two cyclical businesses. Mortgage banking, which has slowed in response to higher interest rates and our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, which a year ago generated elevated gains but recognized impairments in the second quarter of this year due to significantly different market conditions. While all other noninterest income included both positive and negative impacts, it was actually up slightly from the first quarter. The decline in all other noninterest income from a year ago was primarily driven by the impact of last year's divestitures. Turning to expenses on slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 3% from a year ago as expenses related to divestitures came out of the run rate, and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Operating losses increased $273 million from a year ago, primarily driven by increased litigation expense, which included a recovery in the second quarter of last year, and higher customer remediation expense predominantly for a variety of historical matters. Customer remediation matters are complex and take a significant amount of time to resolve and quantify the full impact. While we've made progress, we have more to do to resolve the remaining items. We're halfway through the year. And while we've had higher operating losses than we expected, revenue related expenses are trending lower than expected. Our results in the first half of the year also reflected the progress we're making on our efficiency initiatives with lower headcount and reductions in both professional and outside services expense and occupancy expense. We expect to continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Putting all these factors together, we still expect our full year 2022 expenses to be approximately $51.5 billion, as lower revenue-related expense is expected to offset higher operating losses. But as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory matters and customer remediations and the related expenses could be significant and hard to predict, which could cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion outlook. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and lending on slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances. Our deposit pricing has been stable, but we expect deposit betas to increase over time. As Charlie highlighted, the deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we started to roll out late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for nonsufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions. Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, which will further reduce deposit-related fees. Home lending revenue declined 53% from a year ago and 35% from the first quarter driven by lower mortgage originations and compressed margins, given the higher rate environment and continued competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry. After increasing over 150 basis points in the first quarter, mortgage rates increased over 100 basis points in the second quarter. The impact of higher rates also reduced revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. The mortgage market is expected to remain challenging in the near term, and it's possible that we have a further decline in mortgage banking revenue in the third quarter. We are making adjustments to reduce expenses in response to lower origination volumes, and we expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters. Credit card revenue was up 7%, auto revenue increased 5% and personal lending was up 7% from a year ago, primarily due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on slide 11. Our mortgage originations declined 10% for the first quarter, with growth in correspondent partially offsetting the decline in retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to 28%. Average home lending loan balances grew 2% for the first quarter, driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio, which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs. Turning to auto. Origination volume declined 35% from a year ago and 26% from the first quarter due to increased pricing competition, credit tightening actions and an ongoing industry supply pressures. Turning to debit card. While debit card spend increased 3%, transactions were relatively flat from a year ago, as increases in travel and entertainment were offset by declines in apparel and home improvement. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 28% from a year ago with the largest increases in fuel travel and entertainment. The increase in point-of-sale volume and the launch of new products helped drive a 19% in credit card -- 19% increase in credit card balances from a year ago, we remain disciplined in our underwriting and new credit card accounts. Turning to Commercial Banking results on slide 12. Middle Market banking revenue increased 27% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income from the impact of higher rates and loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances. Noninterest expense increased 2% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs. Efficiency initiatives drove lower personnel expense with headcount down 9% from a year ago. Average loan balances have grown for four consecutive quarters and were up 13% from a year ago. Utilization rates continue to increase, but they are still not back to historical levels. Clients have increased borrowings to rebuild inventory and to support working capital growth, both of which have been impacted by higher inflation. We also had momentum from adding new clients in middle market banking and similar to prior periods, loan growth was driven by the larger clients. Average deposits declined 2% from a year ago driven by actions to manage under the asset cap. Deposit pricing has been relatively stable, but we expect deposit betas will continue to increase. Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on slide 13. Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by stronger treasury management results given the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances. Investment banking fees declined, reflecting lower market activity and $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged finance commitments due to the market spread widening. Average loan balances were up 20% from a year ago, with broad-based loan demand driven by a modest increase in utilization rates due to increased working capital needs given inflationary pressures. Commercial real estate revenues grew 5% from a year ago, driven by loan growth and higher interest rates. Average loan balances were up 22% from a year ago with the disruption in the capital markets, increasing demand for bank financing and line utilization. Markets revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to higher foreign exchange and commodities trading revenue as clients position themselves for rising rates, quantitative tightening and growing recessionary concerns as well as higher equities trading. Average deposits in Corporate and Investment Banking were down 14% from a year ago, driven by continued actions to manage under the asset cap. There's been more deposit pricing pressure in corporate banking than we've seen in Commercial Banking. On slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 5% from a year ago as the increase in net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances more than offset the declines in asset-based fees, driven by lower market valuations as well as lower retail brokerage transaction activity. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second quarter results reflected market valuations as of April 1st, and third quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of July 1st. The S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the second quarter and approximately two-thirds of our advisory assets are in equities. So, there will be another step down in our asset-based fees next quarter. Average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Average deposits declined 1% from a year ago and were down 7% from the first quarter as clients reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives. Deposit pricing increased modestly. Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Both revenues and expenses declined from a year ago and were impacted by the divestitures of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management and the sale of our student loan portfolio. These businesses contributed $580 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2021, including the gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio, and they accounted for approximately $375 million of the decline in expenses in the second quarter compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-down associated with the sale of our student loan portfolio. The decline in revenue in corporate was also due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In summary, while our net income in the second quarter declined driven by lower venture capital and mortgage banking results, our underlying trends reflected our improving earnings capacity with expenses declining and strong net interest income growth from rising rates and higher loan balances. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we expect the growth in net interest income to more than offset any further pressure on non-interest income. While we expect credit losses to increase from historically low levels, our consumer and commercial customers are not showing any meaningful signs of stress. As I highlighted earlier, our expense outlook for the year is unchanged at approximately $51.5 billion subject to the risk to the outlook discussed earlier. Finally, our stress test results demonstrated our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders, including the expected 20% increase in our third quarter common stock dividend subject to board approval. We will now take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning guys. I appreciate the continuity of the expense guide and also the potential variability. Mike, I was just wondering if you could expand on that. Obviously, the operating losses are hanging higher this year than they had been. So just wondering how you start to get a sense of what those look like going forward? And then also just the underlying, as you mentioned, coming in better because of revenue, just any sense of all just how your net saves are looking underneath the surface as well. Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Hey, thanks, Ken. First, I'd start with the efficiency program that we've been talking about now for the better part of 1.5 years. And all of that's tracking as we thought it would. So the core, driving kind of efficiency through the core business lines and operating groups is sort of working the way we thought. When you look at what's happened this year, as you pointed out, operating losses are higher than what we assumed at the beginning of the year. And those things just can be unpredictable at times just as we work through the backlog of items. You know the accounting standard we work with, right? If we knew about something now, we would accrue for it. If we could estimate it, we would accrue for it. But we're just flagging -- continuing the flag that we still have a pipeline of stuff to work through. And then as you highlighted, as we think about this year, the increases in the operating loss line have been offset by -- largely offset by the lower revenue-related expenses. And so we still feel good about that $51.5 billion number that we set out at the beginning of the year. And we're going to continue to work through the pipeline of items. And if something is significant and pops, we will be sure to highlight it as we go forward. Ken Usdin : Yes. And as a follow-up, I know as you guys talked through the recent confer season, it's hard to get a crystal ball with so many moving parts as you think about 2023, but can you just help us try to at least start to think through some of the pushes and takes and can you continue to push us towards getting costs down next year? Thanks guys. Charlie Scharf : Hey, Ken, this is Charlie. Let me take that. The way we think about it is as we sit and look towards next year, we certainly know we have some increases to contend with, such as the full year impact of inflationary pressures that we see this year. And we know we've got some increases in FDIC insurance premiums. But as we start thinking about next year, and we really just starting the budget process, our mindset going into it is that we have significant opportunities to become more efficient. We've been \u2013 and it's just more of the same in terms of what we've been talking about. And this has nothing to do with getting efficiencies out of the risk-related work it assumes that all of that investment continues. But we do go into this process with the expectation that we want to see net expense reductions. Now, just usual caveats that excludes revenue-related expenses, which could go up or some of this \u2013 the lumpiness that we've talked about, just as we think \u2013 but as we think about that core expense base, we do continue to see opportunities, and we'd like you to see it as well. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about capital. It looks like you're entering next quarter with over 100 basis points buffer to your pro forma reg minimums. How should we think about where you'll manage capital to and your potential buyback capacity going forward? And given that you paused for SCB partly because of SCB uncertainty. Will you get to some level of buybacks likely moving forward here? Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Yeah. Hey, John, it's Charlie. Why don't I start and then Mike can chime in. Yeah. I mean, I think your \u2013 no question, we \u2013 clarity of SCB for us at this point does really help. As we sit here today and we look at what's happening in spreads and what's happening with the 10 year that was at 292 right now. But we do want to be a little bit just conservative in terms of how we think about managing the capital base. So just to be \u2013 I think to be clear, as we sit here today, we're very happy with the amount of capital that we have, including, as we think about that 10 basis points increase that will impact us. We certainly have capacity to buy shares back at this point. And as I think Mike alluded to, we just probably want to wait a little bit just to see what happens in terms of the volatility in spreads and rates before we start to do that. But we certainly at a point, we'll do it. We'll just see exactly when that is. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. Maybe I'll just add one or two things, John. I think as Charlie highlighted, we feel good about where we are. I would just point out, we are not \u2013 our G-SIB score is going to stay the same as we go into next year as well. So we don't have another uptick as we go into the beginning of next year. So that's good. And at this point, we don't feel like we need to build capital from where we are to build a bigger buffer and then we'll just be prudent on buybacks as we go through, and through the next few quarters. John McDonald : Okay. And Mike, maybe I can ask a follow-up on the NII revised outlook. What kind of cadence do you see between the next two quarters? It seems like you'd have a big step-up both this coming quarter and the third quarter and then again in the fourth? And then within that NII equation, if you still have this funding gap between loan growth being very strong and deposit growth slowing, is there still plenty of cash to use to fund the loan growth? Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. Sure. I think, ultimately, the exact progression over the next couple of quarters will be a function of how the Fed moves on rates. But I would think of it as somewhat of a ratable step up quarter-to-quarter. So not -- you won't see some outsized results in one versus the other as we go. And you'll continue to see a little bit of loan growth come through. We think that probably moderates a little bit from what we saw in the first half of the year, but you'll see some loan growth there as well as it steps up. And as you say, I think the industry has seen deposits come down a little bit. If you look at the latest version of the Fed data, and you can see that in our results as well. Now for us, it's been a little bit of -- you can see the period end balances in each of the segments, and it's been a little bit of reduction in each of them with the lowest percentage reduction being in the consumer space. So that's a good thing. And as you know, we -- over the last couple of years, we've brought down much of our wholesale funding that we've got out there. And so we've got plenty of capacity to provide liquidity or get the liquidity we need to continue to support clients. John McDonald : So that loan growth funding is coming from your cash balances and other sources of liquidity that you have? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Exactly. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question just clarifying some of the NII guidance. Mike, because you noted that it's a ratable step up and it imply \u2013 the guidance implies about a $12 billion run rate, at least in the back half for NII on an FTE basis. Is it reasonable for us to assume or expect that the exit rate for the year is going to be north of $50 billion? I just want to make sure I clarify that. Mike Santomassimo : Well, Steve, I know you're really good at modeling this stuff. So I'll let you do the modeling. But I think as you pointed out, we're going to see step ups, right, as we go through the next -- as we did this quarter from last quarter. And that will continue into the third and fourth quarter. And now exactly what -- it's hard to use one quarter, as you know, it's just run rate for the rest of the -- for the following year. But certainly, the exit rate is going to be a lot higher than even where we are today. And then we'll have to just see what the environment is like at that point how to think about whether that's a clean run rate to build off of, or are there other things they're getting away. And as you can see, over the last -- even over the last three, four, five, six weeks, whatever it's been, the amount of volatility that's out there on the long end and what happens with loan growth, does it keep at the same pace. And so there's a lot of factors, I think, that go into what 2023 would look. But as you pointed out, our exit rate will be pretty healthy. Steven Chubak : Thanks. Mike, and just for one follow-up also on the NII guide. Just wanted to get a better sense as to what's being contemplated in terms of deposit paydown, the deposit paydown and repricing just came in much better than beers this quarter. You've cited the benefits of the deposit and funding optimization you've executed these past few years. Just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about that deposit trajectory that's underpinning some of the NII guidance. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I mean I think that's -- we're not expecting balances to grow much from where they are. And I think we'll see what happens as -- if we see continued outflows of deposits, but as you put it out, like our mix of deposits as we came in this environment sets us up pretty well, and you can see that in the results so far where the consumer deposits are a much bigger percentage of the overall pod than they were just a couple of years ago. As you think about beta, so far, they've basically progressed as we thought in each of the segments. And so we really haven't seen much variation to what we thought at this point in the rate cycle. Now if the Fed does raise rates 75 basis points at the next meeting, now you're starting to get into territory that we didn't see in the last rate cycle -- rate rising cycle. And so we're going to start to see betas increase from there. And I think that's exactly at what pace and where you need to be defensive or not on the wholesale side of the -- on the commercial side, we'll see, and we're pretty nimble and are able to react to it. But so far, everything has progressed as we thought it would. And so we're going to keep a pretty close eye on it as we go over the next few months. And I think that will -- this quarter and into the fourth quarter, I think, will give us a lot of interesting data points to know how to think about it over a longer period of time. Steven Chubak : Great color. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just as it relates to revenues overall, the NII trajectory, obviously, quite strong and in a sense seems mostly self-evident for now. But I was hoping, Mike, you could discuss, please, fee trajectory in a bit more detail. I guess, we\u2019re hovering in a $7 billion or $7.5 billion a quarter range if we exclude some of that noise from the equity marks, the securities gains, et cetera. In your mind, are we at a low and can we grow from that base? I know you touched on mortgage, maybe coming down and then we got wealth, but just sort of puts and takes as you see that, if you could, please? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, sure. Thanks, Scott. I'll just bring you through some of the key fee lines just to give you a sense of some of the dynamics, right? So on the deposit side, it's been pretty -- we saw a step down in the quarter, largely a result of the changes we made in overdraft fees. We'll see a little bit more step down as we go through the year, probably more a fourth quarter thing than a third quarter thing, as we implement the additional changes there, but there's -- other than that, there's a lot of stability generally to that line based on underlying activity. We'll see what happens in the market and how that drives the investment advisory and asset based fee line. That's -- it's going to be key to see what happens in the equity and the fixed income markets. And as we bring more stability enters into the market that really supports that fee line. And as you know that\u2019s our single biggest line item as you look at that fees. Investment banking. It's really going to be market driven, but we -- our fees were pretty low, including the small mark that we had on -- in leveraged finance. And so it's hard to see that going too much lower, but that's really going to be driven by the activity levels. Card spend, we're seeing still good, although it slowed maybe a little in May and June. We're still seeing really good activity in the card space and people are outspending. So that's helpful. Mortgage banking, as you highlighted, I think, is likely going to come down a little more in the third quarter, but it's off a much smaller base. You can still have pretty big -- you can have decent sized percentage declines there, but it's still -- it's really small dollars at this point. And then we'll see as the market progresses and how that impacts the equity security side. But -- so I think hopefully, we're getting more stability here, but some of it will be dependent upon what we see in the markets. Scott Siefers : All right. That's perfect. Thank you very much. And if I could switch gears just a bit back to CCAR and the SCB, I guess, it's possible I had sort of misinterpreted your guys' remarks over the last few quarters. But I sort of felt like you guys were maybe prepping us for possibly somewhat worse outcome in terms of where the SCB would flush out. In your mind, how did that CCAR and the -- that SCB, just because it barely budged, right? So how did that all flush out relative to what you guys have kind of been anticipating? Charlie Scharf : Yes. What we said a couple of times was that we thought it was possible that it was going to increase, and it did. Now you have to keep in mind, like we only have so much visibility into the underlying drivers of what causes it to go up or down in any given year. Now there's a lot of stuff that's public, but there's also a lot of a lot of the modeling techniques that aren\u2019t quite easy to understand. And so, I would say we were pleased with the result, and we spent -- as many do probably, we spend a lot of time on trying to understand the drivers of the risk of the balance sheet and do our best to have positioned ourselves for good outcomes. And so, we were pleased at where it came out. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you guys very much. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Charlie Scharf : Hey, John. Good morning. John Pancari : Just on the deposit front, just to go back to that. Just want to confirm. So from here your best estimate now is to overall deposit balances are relatively stable in the back half of the year. Or do you think you could see some incremental declines, just as betas are rising? Mike Santomassimo : I think you can certainly see a little bit more decline from here potentially. I think that\u2019s not an unreasonable expectation. Exactly timing and how that\u2019s going to progress, I think, is hard to predict with any real degree of accuracy, just given the environment we\u2019re in right now. But I think it\u2019s possible, they can be out a little bit more from here. John Pancari : Okay. All right. Thanks, Mike. And then on the credit front, I wanted to get your thoughts on the likelihood of reserve build. I know you added to the reserve for loan growth this quarter, but -- in terms of an overall build of the reserve as you -- from a CECL perspective, as you look at your economic scenarios, where do you see this quarter with your CECL scenarios that didn't warrant a sizable build? And I guess, longer term, as this plays out and we see the Fed continue with the tightening, what do you view as a potential level that you may have to bring to reserve to, is a pandemic level too high and you can help us with the magnitude there? Charlie Scharf : Well, as you think about the process we go through, which I think is similar to most in a lot of ways, is you're really looking at a number of scenarios that you need to be thoughtful about and include in your modeling. And we've now, for a number of quarters in a row, have had a significant weighting on the downside scenario already. And some of those scenarios are pretty severe, right? And so you've got waitings on what some might term wild recession, more severe recessions, so you could create a lot of labels for them. But it's a number of scenarios that have different severities of downside. And so, we feel at this point that we've captured what we can look at and see or anticipate at this point based on all the factors that we need to evaluate in our current reserves. And I'll just point out also, as you look at us in the position we're in, yes, we didn't take down all of the reserves that we put up during COVID. And so as you sort of look through each of the underlying asset classes, we feel what we have today is appropriate. It's hard to see in the near term increasing them to the level that we had back in the pandemic. But I think that's a hard thing to see at this point. But I think we'll have to make sure as things evolve throughout the next couple of quarters. we'll have to incorporate that. But again, we already have a pretty significant weighting on those downside scenarios already. And it's a very -- as you would imagine, a very robust conversation that we go through each quarter to evaluate how we feel about it. And at this point, we feel it's appropriate for what we can see over the life of those loans. Scott Siefers : Got it. All right. One more related to on credit quickly. The $170 million write-down in unfunded leverage finance commitments, that you took. Is there a risk of future marks there? Is that primarily just predicated on market spreads? And then separately, what is your -- can you remind us what your total leveraged loan exposure both in terms of commitments and outright outstandings? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, we don't -- you got to think of these as unfunded commitments, not funded, right? So, as you sort of think about them, don't think about them outstanding, thinking about them as unfunded commitments, number one. And you really have to, over time, think about term loans versus high yield a little bit differently. And on the high-yield side, we don't disclose this, but we haven't disclosed the actual number, but it's really small in the scheme of the balance sheet and the term loan side, which generally has a little bit more stability to it and less volatility to it is the bigger part. All these deals are subject to further spread widening, given the environment we're in, for sure. We -- at the end of the quarter, took our best -- used our best judgment to market where we thought the deals would clear. And we'll see how that over the coming months. Scott Siefers : Okay, great. Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. I just had 1 more follow-up question. And Mike, I apologize if this is the umpteenth question on NII. I appreciate all your color in terms of what's driving the NII guide of 20%. I was wondering if you could better quantify the deposit beta that you would expect by year-end on a cumulative basis. Appreciate that you said it would accelerate. But given that some of your peers have given specific guides and given how much the quality of your deposit base has changed for the better over the past several years, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what that beta range that you're assuming by year-end on a cumulative basis that underpins that guide? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Yes, Erika, I think that's a really hard thing to give a pinpoint number on at this point in the cycle, to be honest with you. And if you think about -- and it's -- there's so many moving pieces right now, I think, between -- particularly as you sort of get to year-end and the pace of rates? And what exactly is the Fed going to do and when are they going to do it? And so I think there's a lot that goes into that, that trying to get a -- one number is a hard thing to say with a lot of confidence in my view. I think what we can say though is as you look at the next couple of rate rises, I think you're going to start to see more acceleration. On the retail and the consumer side, the core -- deposit core rates haven't changed much for the big banks at this point yet. So you'll start to see that happen over the next couple of rate rises, the betas will still be pretty small. However, that will start to pick up just depending on how fast the Fed goes by year-end. And then I think on the other side of the spectrum on the corporate investment bank and those deposits, whether it's in the FI space or the large corporate space, you're seeing those betas pick up a lot already. So those will continue to accelerate. And so when you look at cumulative betas, you really have to look at and you start to compare different banks, you're really going to have to look at the mix of the deposits. And the CIB deposits are just a much smaller piece of the pie for us right now. And those are going to -- those will probably move faster than even we've modeled, but it's a small piece of it. So I think we'll see how it goes, and we'll give you as much insight as we can. But I think trying to predict cumulative betas by year-end is hard. Erika Najarian : Got it. I understand. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. Operator : Band of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Just following up on that, Mike. So I appreciate you don't want to get pinned down on deposit beta, but is it fair for us to assume just given mix shift in deposits given how you manage the balance sheet during the pandemic, we should see your deposit beta at least track in line or maybe even lower relative to the last rate cycle? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I think we've -- as you think about each asset, each type of deposit, to-date, they're tracking pretty close to what we saw last cycle. But you then look at the mix of our deposit base, and that's what's changed pretty substantially since the last go around. And so if beta stayed the same as last cycle byproduct, given our mix has changed, you would see a lower average deposit beta. But there's a lot to play out as we go through the rest of the year, but in each of the underlying products. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's fair. I just wanted to make sure we weren't missing something because there are peers who probably are expecting a higher beta than last cycle. So I just wanted to hear you talk through that. And as a follow-up, and I know these are extremely tough in terms of when you think about the market, private market valuations on your equity investments. But give us a sense of just where the markets are in terms of taking these markdowns, should we anticipate some more negative marks in a world where there's no big turnaround in equity markets over the next few quarters. I just want to make sure like expectations are level set for that line and how that impacts fees and PPNR? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Sure. Look, and again, it really all depends on what happens in the public equity markets, which is in part driving those declines. So if we see some stabilization, that's constructive. If we see much deeper declines, that's we'll have to evaluate how that impacts these portfolio investments. And obviously, if the market starts to rally, that's even more constructive. So I think the public equity markets and will be a good guide to how to think about whether or not we have to evaluate whether there's more reductions here or not. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And it looks like we're tracking to a 15% drop, say, maybe by the end of the year? That was a statement. I didn't expect you to respond. Thanks for taking my questions. Charlie Scharf : No problem. I'm glad you made it rhetorical. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Mike, can you give us some color on you guys had some good success in the quarter in generating gains from your trading activities and your debt securities. Can you just share with us what drove that and what your expectations might be in the next quarter or two? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. I mean, on the training side, it was really good performance in our macro fixed income businesses, commodities, FX, a little bit of rates. And so I think that's all what contributed to it. And we'll see, obviously, the continued performance, there is subject to what we see happening in the markets. It's not \u2013 we're not out there taking any kind of incremental risk that we normally take. It's really helping clients facilitate the flow that they've got there, and so we'll see how that goes. And as you can see, it's a relatively smaller number for us versus maybe some others. As you think about the securities portfolio, I wouldn't assume, there'll be continued gains there. I think we did do a small, small remixing of our securities portfolio. Some of it was RWA. Some of it was RWA optimization I think selling some UMBS is buying Ginnies that where spreads were pretty tight at the time we did it. You save an RWA you don't give up much yield. And there are a few other minor optimizations we did there. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up question, when it comes to your professional and outside services expenses, can you frame out for us how much of that is tie to \u2013 your current working with the regulators to lift the asset cap in the cease and desist order. When that day eventually arrives? Will the professional and outside services numbers really have a kind of meaningful downward move, because you've resolved that issue? Charlie Scharf : This is Charlie. Let me take a shot at this first. Listen, I think we have the work we're doing on all of the risk and infrastructure work, which supports the regulatory matters. It's our own headcount. It's professional. It's a bunch of technology work. It really cuts across a whole series of lines. And I just don't really think it's the right time for us to start even talking about where those saves could come from. And it's just genuinely not on a radar screen in terms of what we're thinking about where it's going to go or anything like that. So I'd rather just defer the question at this point. Gerard Cassidy : No problem. Understood. And then, Mike, just coming back to your comment about the mix of deposits, and this is a rhetorical question as well. As we see for the first time in 15 years, consumer deposits in a higher rate environment, we'll make guys like you guys stand out maybe over some of your peers. So, good luck with that. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, Gerard. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hey, good morning. Charlie Scharf : Hey, Betsy. Mike Santomassimo : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Charlie, I think you recently mentioned that you're in the process of strategically thinking about where mortgage fits in. And I guess I wanted to understand, what kind of framework you're assessing mortgage under. What you're thinking about that? Charlie Scharf : Sure. Yes. And that was, by the way, not meant to be a new comment. That's something that we've been doing ever since I got here, and we brought a new management, including Kristy Fercho, who runs the business. And I mean, if you just go back and look at how big we were in the mortgage business, we were a hell of a lot bigger than we are today. And so we have been all along just reassessing what makes sense for us to do, how big we want to be both in the context of what our focus should be in terms of our primary focus should be on service -- serving our own customer base -- and then to the extent that we have efficiencies, would it makes sense for us to do other business. But I guess my point was we're not interested in being extraordinarily large in the mortgage business just for the sake of being in the mortgage business. We're in the home lending business because we think home lending is an important product for us to talk to our customers about. And that will ultimately dictate the appropriate size of it. And so I would just -- when you look at how much we're originating versus the size of our servicing business. The servicing business over time will become smaller. And I think that's a smart and good thing for us for many reasons. And as I said, we're just going to -- we're going to focus on products that make sense for us in the context of where we can make money over the cycles, given all of the complexities and all the requirements that banks have that not necessarily everyone else have and make sure we're getting the right returns for it. Betsy Graseck : Yes. So is this a migration towards originate and retain and the mortgage servicing line goes away as an income statement item because it becomes non-material, or is there some middle ground that you're looking to? Charlie Scharf : No, yes. No, I would -- I mean, listen, we're still -- I would still assume that a substantial amount of our mortgage production would be eligible for sale. And whether it's through the agencies or through public market, that's all options that we want to continue. And so we'll still be originating mortgages across the spectrum, some of which will keep on balance sheet when it makes sense and others of which we'll sell, and we will have an MSR. Again, if you just look at how much we originated historically versus what we're originating today, it will naturally just come down over time. Betsy Graseck : Then two other questions. One, I think you recently announced a change in your consumer head. Could you speak through rationale for that? And what the wish list is for your new head of consumer? Charlie Scharf : Yes. So Mike Weinbach, who had come in to run our home lending businesses. Put a whole series of things in place, including if you look at the leadership across all of our card business, our home lending business, our personal lending business in our auto business, all those -- that's an entirely new management team, plus new heads of -- I can go through all the other functions as well. And Mike put that in place, and we talked about it and he wanted to do something different. And so we're lucky enough to have a gentleman named Kleber Santos, who joined us 1.5 years to two years ago. Background he was a Capital One prior to that and McKinsey prior to that, and Kelber and I have worked extremely closely together and just thrilled to have him in that role. And so I think I wouldn't expect to see significant changes in the things that we've spoken about. We're focused on continuing the product build-out on the credit card side, again, focusing on customers that are broader customers in the franchise. Building our customer service around that and building out our digital capabilities and all the other parts of the business, which is work that we have underway. So I don't anticipate any material changes from where we are just with continued trends and the things that we've been talking about. Betsy Graseck : Great. And then just lastly on wealth. It's an important part of your offering. I'm wondering what you're doing to strategically enhance that offering to your clients, be it either through product or how you're structured integration with consumer, your IT platform and solutions. Could you just give us a couple of bullet points on what's going on there? Charlie Scharf : Sure. Let me start, Mike. And Mike and I are both very involved in these conversations with Barry and his team I think if you look at our wealth business, it's run entirely different today than it was several years ago. We had separate platforms historically here between our brokerage business. We had two different private banks that operated under two different brands. We had our bank channel. And then completely separately, we had a digital platform, and we had a platform or advisers that wanted to go independent. The digital platforms and the platform for independent advisers had very little investment in it. And those would run -- but all of those businesses, they were run as separate businesses with separate product platforms and separate technology. And so what we've done is we now have one set of products and service capabilities that all of those product lines have access to. And we've combined the entire field under one leader. And we're investing in our digital capabilities, and we're investing in the capabilities of those that want to go independent. So if they want to do that, they can stay here as opposed to elsewhere. We are building out capabilities across all the dimensions from the investment capabilities to the banking capabilities, our lending capabilities, offering trust in the other areas of distribution that didn't have access to those in the past. And so it's a huge set of changes, which also bring with it a set of changes in the back end, which we're going to move -- we're moving towards common platforms. And it's something we're really excited about, and we're just at the beginning of seeing the benefits of it. And I think it's one of the things that will make us appear to -- for our financial advisers, it\u2019s been extremely attractive place to be, whether they want to be an employee and work for Wells Fargo or they want to be independent and access our capabilities. Betsy Graseck : And that changed to moving to common platforms. What's the timing of that? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. It's not a technology move. I think he's talking about platforms in terms of the overall sort of the way we operate business. So there isn't -- it isn't dependent upon a big technology conversion, Betsy. So -- and then I would just highlight one last thing. Charlie in his prepared remarks, talked about Wells Fargo Premier. That's step one in really helping provide more differentiated and holistic service offering to our affluent clients in the consumer business and the Wealth piece is going to be big part of that. And we already have 1,500 plus advisers in the branch system to do. We already have a great investment platform. And so we're in the early days, but building out a differentiated service offering there as well, which will be a big part of the wealth businesses going forward. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And that's in conjunction with consumer business. Mike Santomassimo : Correct. Charlie Scharf : Yes. I would say -- yes, just not expand even further, Betsy. It's really a combination of the advisers and the products that Berry has to offer in our wealth management business. It is also leveraging the lending products that Clover is now responsible for, including credit card and including mortgage and potentially, auto and some other things there. In integrated offering with Mary's bank customers who are affluent. So it's an offering across all of our product sets directed in a much more segmented way than we've ever done in the past. And so we're extremely excited about it, and we'll be talking more about things that were capabilities that were going to be rolling out throughout the year. Betsy Graseck : Great. Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Thanks for taking my questions. Charlie, I just wanted to follow-up on your question -- your comment about loan growth likely to moderate from the first half? Any color on that? What do you think drives that moderation? Which categories? Mike Santomassimo : Hey, Vivek, it's Mike. I'll -- maybe I'll take a shot at that. Look, we've just seen -- I just don't think what we've seen in the second quarter will continue to happen at the same pace. We may get surprised and it will be a little better than we think. But I think at some point, we just feel, as you look at any of the uncertainty that might be there or other factors that are causing clients that use their lines today that just may moderate as we go through it. I wouldn't look at it as some big warning of anything to come. It's just we're being a little -- we're being a little prudent in terms of the way we think about that growth rate and maybe we'll be surprised on the upside a little, but it's just what we're seeing right now. Vivek Juneja : So you're not seeing any signs like sort of late in the quarter, I think, already starting to show some slowdown or some conversations with clients that are indicating that? Is that\u2026 Mike Santomassimo : Not that I would say are super significant at this point. But when you go category-by-category and say, okay, well, spending in the card space continue to increase at the same pace given some of the uncertainty in the economic environment, we'll see maybe commercial real estate, certainly, given what we're seeing in the real estate market there, that appears like it will slow down a little bit again in the second half of the year. Somewhat driven by what we're seeing in the capital markets side of that business as well. And so with the slowdown in deals happening and rates rising, that's just as a natural slowdown there. And so I just think you go asset class by asset class, it just feels as though we'll see a little bit of moderation as we go through the rest of the year. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And one minor one, Mike, for you, the hung loan loss number that you gave us, was it a gross mark or is it net of fees? Mike Santomassimo : The loan -- the leveraged finance one, Vivek? Vivek Juneja : Yes. Yes. Mike Santomassimo : That's after fees. Vivek Juneja : That's after fees. Okay. So then what's the gross mark on that? Mike Santomassimo : I don't have the exact number in front of me. It's not materially different. Vivek Juneja : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one more question today, and that will come from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open sir. Matt O'Connor: Hi, I was wondering if you could remind us the targeted customer within credit card as you lean into that business? And do you think about maybe slowing from the expansion plans there, just given all the recession talking? Charlie Scharf : Yes. This is Charlie, Matt. First of all, our targeted customer, those that we want to have a broader relationship with. What we have said is that as we've rolled out this new product set, when you look at the credit quality of the borrowers and the spenders that we have been giving our new cards due to the credit quality is actually stronger than it had been historically. And it still is either on target or stronger than we would have modeled for when we rolled the products out. It's just we're not competing on credit terms. We're not competing in any way, shape or form in terms of that. We just want to have a quality offering, we would expect it to be a high-quality card customer that we can do other things with across our franchise. Matt O'Connor: And just any disclosure on FICO scores in terms of either the overall portfolio or the customer that you're growing are leading into? Charlie Scharf : Yes, I think you can get some of that in the Q, Matt, you got to go a little deep into the queue, but you can get some of that in the distribution table in the Q. Matt O'Connor: Okay. I'll look for it there. Thanks. Charlie Scharf : All right, everyone. Thank you very much. We appreciate everything and we look forward to talking to you all. Take care. Operator : Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.",

I will make some brief comments about our third quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I will then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with the third quarter highlights. Our solid business performance this quarter was significantly impacted by $2 billion or $0.45 per share in operating losses related to litigation, customer remediation and regulatory matters primarily related to a variety of historical matters. As you know, we have been and remain focused on increasing our earnings capacity and see the positive impact of rising interest rates, driving strong net interest income growth and our continued focus on improving operating efficiencies, resulting in lower expenses, excluding operating losses. Credit quality remains strong and we continue to invest in our technology platforms, digital capabilities and delivering additional products to our customers and clients. While we are closely monitoring trends with economic conditions expected to weaken given inflation, geopolitical instability, energy price volatility and rising interest rates, our customers continue to be resilient with overall strong credit performance and solid cash flow. When looking at simple averages across the entire consumer portfolio, deposit balances per account decreased from the second quarter, but were still higher than a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels. However, we continue to closely monitor activity by segment for signs of potential spreads and for certain cohorts of customers. We have seen average balances steadily decline and are now below pre-pandemic levels and their debit card spend continues to decline. This is a continuation of what I referenced last quarter, but it\u2019s important to note that this remains a small percentage of our total customer base. Overall, our consumer deposit customers\u2019 health indicators, including cash flow, payroll and overdraft trends, are still not showing elevated risk concerns. Debit card spending remained significantly above pre-pandemic levels and was up 3% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, consistent with the second quarter increase. Entertainment and fuel spending had the largest increases from a year ago, but the recent decline in fuel prices drove fuel spending to decline compared to the second quarter. Apparel and home improvement spending declined from both the year ago and second quarter. Credit card spend remained strong in the third quarter, up 25% from a year ago, with double-digit increases coming across all spending categories. Spending was up modestly on a linked quarter basis. So remember, the significant portion of this growth is from our new products, which continued to have strong credit profiles. Period-end commercial loan balances were stable compared to the second quarter, with continued growth in commercial banking, offset by declines across our businesses in corporate and investment banking. Credit performance remained strong, with net charge-offs and non-accrual loans continuing to decline from exceptionally low levels. Clients do tell us that they continue to be impacted by persistent inflation, rising interest rates and tight labor market. And while credit quality remains strong, we are actively monitoring inflation-sensitive industries and taking proactive actions where warranted. Now, let me update you on the progress we are making on our strategic priorities. We continue to devote significant resources to implementing an appropriate risk and control framework across the company and this remains our top priority. We continue to make progress and are executing on our plans, but significant work remains. As a reminder, though I am confident in our ability to complete the work, it remains a significant body of work and the primary focus of the company. We have set high standards for success and given the longstanding nature of much of our work, we have said that we remain at risk of setbacks until it is complete. Expenses in the quarter reflect these ongoing risks and our efforts to resolve them. As we continue our work to put our historical issues behind us and to address issues that are identified as we advance our risk control infrastructure work, outstanding issues still remain that will likely result in additional expense in the coming quarters, which could be significant. We are working to close these as quickly as possible and we remain committed to doing right for our customers and working closely with our regulators and others to resolve these matters. We recognize the importance of moving forward and the expenses in the quarter are representative of these efforts. At the same time, we are implementing changes to better serve our customers and investing in our businesses to help drive growth. As part of the announcement we made earlier this year to limit overdraft-related fees and give customers more options to achieve their financial goals, we implemented extra day grace period for the third quarter, which provides consumer customers an extra business day to cure negative balances and avoid overdraft fees. We also began to rollout early payday, which provides consumer customers who receive eligible direct deposits the ability to access funds up to 2 days earlier than scheduled, further reducing the potential to incur overdrafts. Notably, while this enhancement was rolled out in only 6 states in the third quarter, during the first 2 weeks of offering this enhancement, we provided customers early access to $2 billion in funds from 1.3 million eligible direct deposits. And we are on track for a fourth quarter rollout of an easy-to-access short-term credit product that will give qualifying customers another option to meet their personal financial needs. These actions build on services that we have introduced over the past several years, including offering an account that does not charge any overdraft fees. We now have over 1.6 million of those clear access banking accounts, up 57% from a year ago. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have developed a new integrated banking, lending and investment offering that is geared towards the more complex financial needs of our affluent clients called Wells Fargo Premier. During the quarter, we introduced Wells Fargo Premier across our entire branch footprint, initiated a branded digital experience and launched marketing programs to help affluent customers learn more about how we can better serve them. We will continue to build the Wells Fargo Premier offering in a tough in the coming quarters. In the third quarter, we continued to launch new APIs, providing our commercial and corporate clients more flexibility and helping them drive efficiencies. For example, we launched a new real-time payment API allowing clients to send digital requests to a payer that can be approved to easily send a real-time credit transfer. We also launched a virtual card API, which enables clients to create and configure virtual cards for B2B vendor payments and purchases. In our CIB Markets businesses, we are accelerating our investment into our electronic trading capabilities across multiple asset classes to better meet the evolving needs of our clients, which is helping to drive strong gains in trading volumes. And we are selectively adding talent in our investment banking coverage and product areas as we focus on leveraging our strong existing relationships to build our fee-based businesses. We also continued to make progress on the environmental, social and governance work that is underway at Wells Fargo. In the third quarter, we published our latest ESG report, which highlights the progress we made in 2021 on our ESG efforts. We consider this work a sustained long-term commitment and believe Wells Fargo is well positioned to make a difference. We issued our second sustainability bond in the amount of $2 billion that will finance projects and programs supporting housing affordability, economic opportunity, renewable energy and clean transportation. During the third quarter, we officially launched a new grant program in Houston, San Diego and Milwaukee to help improve racial equity in home ownership and we have more markets coming before the end of this year. This is part of the $60 million commitment we made earlier this year through the Wells Fargo Foundation to wealth opportunities restored through home ownership or worth. This effort aims to create 40,000 homeowners of color access \u2013 40,000 homeowners of color across 8 markets by the end of 2025. We announced a $1 million donation to provide urgent relief to Florida following the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. In addition, customer accommodations and employee support are available to those directly impacted by the storm. In summary, continued high inflation has kept the better reserve aggressive with rate hikes, leading the housing market to slow rapidly and the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and geopolitical events caused the financial markets to be volatile. However, labor demand remains robust, consumer balance sheets remain healthy, and customers have capacity to borrow. Wells Fargo is positioned well as we will continue to benefit from higher rates and ongoing disciplined expense management. Both consumer and business customers remain in a strong financial condition and we continue to see historically low delinquencies and high payment rates across our portfolios. We are closely monitoring risks related to continued impact of high inflation and increasing rates as well as the broader geopolitical risks and we do expect to see increases in delinquencies and ultimately, credit losses, but the timing remains unclear. As we look forward, we remain bullish on our business opportunities. Our higher operating margins and strong capital ratios have prepared us for a wide range of macroeconomic scenarios. In the third quarter, we increased our common stock dividend by 20% and our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, 110 basis points above our current regulatory minimum, including buffers. We will continue to prudently manage our capital levels to be appropriately prepared for slowing economy and market volatility. Finally, I know many of you are interested in our 2023 expectations and on our next earnings call, we plan to provide our 2023 expense and net interest income outlook as well as more color on our path to an over the cycle of 15% ROTCE. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie and good morning everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.5 billion or $0.85 per diluted common share. As Charlie highlighted, our results included $2 billion or $0.45 per share of accruals primarily related to a variety of historical matters. These accruals drove our total expenses higher. However, if you exclude operating losses, our expenses would have declined as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Revenue grew in the third quarter, driven by higher net interest income, while non-interest income also increased from the second quarter. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 20.2%. We highlight capital on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio is 10.3%, down 6 basis points from the second quarter as the 21 basis point decline from AOCI as well as the impact from dividend payments was nearly offset by our third quarter earnings. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect. As a reminder, our GSIB surcharge will not increase in 2023. We did not buyback any common stock in the second or third quarters and we will continue to be prudent regarding the amount and timing of any share repurchases. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5, credit performance remained strong, with only 17 basis points of net charge-offs in the third quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows and we expect them to continue to normalize towards pre-pandemic levels over time as the Federal Reserve continues to take actions to combat inflation. We are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risks and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards. Commercial credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses, with only $6 million of net charge-offs and net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio for the third consecutive quarter. We also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios. However, total consumer net charge-offs increased $72 million from the second quarter to 40 basis points on average loans driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the auto portfolio. Higher loss rates on certain auto loans originated primarily in the latter part of 2021 contributed to the linked quarter increase in charge-offs and delinquent loans in the auto portfolio. Lower loan balances also impacted the loss rate, which started \u2013 we started taking credit tightening actions earlier this year, which have improved the quality of 2022 originations. As a result of these actions, increased pricing competition and continued industry supply chain constraints, the third quarter origination volumes were down over 40% compared to a year ago. Non-performing assets declined again in the third quarter and were down $411 million or 7% from the second quarter and down 20% from a year ago. While commercial non-accruals continued to decline, lower levels of consumer non-accruals were the primary driver of lower non-performing assets due to a decrease in residential mortgage non-accrual loans from the impact of customers\u2019 sustained payment performance after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Our allowance for credit losses increased $385 million in the third quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth and a less favorable economic environment. On Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 11% from a year ago and 2% from the second quarter. Period-end loans increased for the fifth consecutive quarter, but growth slowed as expected, with commercial loan balances holding relatively stable from the second quarter while consumer loans grew driven by credit card and first lien residential mortgage loans, partially offset by continued declines in our auto portfolio. I will highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased nearly 100 basis points from a year ago and 76 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the higher rate environment. Average deposits declined 3% from both the year ago and the second quarter, with declines across our deposit-gathering businesses. Compared with the second quarter, Wealth and Investment Management had the largest decline by dollar amount as clients looked for higher yielding alternatives. Declines in our commercial businesses were driven mostly by outflows of non-operational deposits, which can be more price sensitive and are a less stable source of funding. Outflows in Consumer and Small Business Banking were driven by continued customer spending and increased outflows from customers seeking higher yielding products. Our average deposit cost increased 10 basis points from the second quarter to 14 basis points. Pricing has been consistent with our expectations, with deposit costs holding relatively stable in consumer banking and lending, while trending higher across other businesses. As rates continue to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase in customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products to also increase. Turning to net interest income on Slide 7. Third quarter net interest income increased $3.2 billion or 36% from a year ago and $1.9 billion or 19% from the second quarter. The growth from the second quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgage-backed securities. We also benefit from higher loan balances and 1 additional day in the quarter. These benefits were partially offset by higher funding costs. In the first 9 months of this year, net interest income was up 19% compared with a year ago. We currently expect full year 2022 net interest income to be approximately 24% higher than a year ago, with fourth quarter 2022 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.9 billion. Turning to expenses on Slide 8, the increase in non-interest expense from both a year ago and from the second quarter was due to the higher operating losses that I highlighted earlier. Excluding operating losses, other non-interest expense was down 5% from a year ago as we had lower revenue-related compensation, expenses related to divestitures came out of the run-rate and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Excluding operating losses, our expenses would have been down on a year-over-year basis for six consecutive quarters. Another way you can see the impact of our efficiency initiatives is through lower headcount, which has declined for nine consecutive quarters and was down 6% from a year ago. We have also reduced professional and outside services expense by 10% and occupancy expense by 4% during the first 9 months this year. The higher level of operating losses in the third quarter will cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion expense outlook for 2022, which included $1.3 billion of operating losses for the full year. We currently expect our fourth quarter other expenses, excluding operating losses, to be approximately $12.3 billion. As Charlie highlighted, outstanding litigation, customer remediation and regulatory matters still remain \u2013 that will still remain and will likely result in additional expense in the coming quarters, which could be significant. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 9. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 29% from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances. Deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out earlier this year, which eliminated non-sufficient funds and some other fees. The extra day grace period launched in the beginning of August and early payday begin in select states in mid-September, so we would expect our deposit-related fees to decline further in the fourth quarter. Industry mortgage rates have increased over 300 basis points since the beginning of the year and ended the quarter at the highest level since 2007, driving weekly mortgage applications as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association to a 25-year low at quarter end. As a result, our home lending revenue declined 52% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and gain on sale margins as well as lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. While the mortgage market adjusts to lower volumes, we expect it to remain challenging in the near-term and it\u2019s possible that we have a further decline in the mortgage banking revenue in the fourth quarter when originations are seasonally slower. We continue to remove excess capacity to align with the reduced demand and expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters. Credit card revenue was up 8% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, which benefited from higher point-of-sale volume and new product launches. Auto revenue declined 5% from a year ago driven by loan spread compression and partially offset by higher loan balances. And Personal Lending was 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by growth in origination volumes. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 10. Mortgage originations declined 59% from a year ago and 37% in the second quarter, with declines in both correspondent and retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to 16% in the third quarter. Average home lending loan balances grew 2% from the second quarter, driven by growth in our non-conforming portfolio. I already highlighted the drivers of the decline in auto originations. So turning to debit card, while debit card spend increased 3% from a year ago, spending declined 2% from the second quarter. As Charlie highlighted, credit card point-of-sale purchase volumes were up 25% from a year ago, with the largest percentage increases in fuel and travel. Average balances were up 21% from a year ago, reflecting the strong point of sale volume which also benefited from the launch of new products, with new accounts up 11%. We will continue to remain disciplined in our underwriting of new credit card accounts. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 11. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 54% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue increased 27% from a year ago, driven by higher net gains from equity securities, higher loan balances and higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Non-interest expense increased 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs and higher operating losses. Average loan balances have grown for five consecutive quarters, and were up 17% from a year ago. Line utilization rates were fairly stable relative to the second quarter, inflation and our customers\u2019 continued efforts to rebuild inventory as supply chain challenges remain drove the growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing. Loan growth in the Middle Market Banking continued to come from larger clients, which more than offset declines from smaller clients. Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 12. Banking revenue increased 28% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances. Investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity. Compared with the second quarter, the increase in investment banking fees was due to the write-down of unfunded leveraged finance commitments last quarter. Commercial real estate revenue grew 29% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances, the impact of higher interest rates as well as improved commercial mortgage bank-backed securities gain on sale margins. Markets revenue increased 6% from a year ago, reflecting volatility and strong client-demanded equities, rates and commodities and foreign exchange trading. Average loans grew 19% from a year ago, with broad-based growth across our businesses to fund clients\u2019 working capital needs, but the pace of growth slowed in the third quarter with average balances up 3% and period-end loans down 3% from the second quarter. On Slide 13, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 1% from a year ago as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates offset the decline in asset-based fees driven by lower market valuations. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected the lower market valuations as of July 1. And while the S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the third quarter, the decrease was not as steep as the second quarter decline. So while there will be another step down in asset-based fees in the fourth quarter it will be less significant than the third quarter decline. Expenses decreased 4% from a year ago due to lower revenue-related compensation. Average loans increased 3% from a year ago driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Slide 14 highlights our corporate results. Both revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our Corporate Trust services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $459 million of revenue and accounted for approximately $305 million of expense in the third quarter of 2021. Revenue also declined from a year ago due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, and given current market conditions, we don\u2019t expect equity gains to improve in the fourth quarter. Expenses increased from a year ago due to higher operating losses. In summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in the quarter significantly impacted our results, the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect our improving earnings capacity. We had strong net interest income growth from rising rates, and if you exclude operating losses, our expenses would have declined as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Both our credit performance and capital levels remain strong. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question for today will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir. John McDonald : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Mike, I wanted to ask on the expenses. The first \u2013 in terms of the operating losses, I know it\u2019s tough to answer, but should we think of the op loss accrual this quarter as you reassessing what you might have to pay in the future, or you got hit with some stuff that you didn\u2019t expect and you\u2019ve already paid up? Is there some combination of those? How should we think about what happened this quarter with the op loss accrual? Charlie Scharf : Hey, John, it\u2019s Charlie. Look, I guess the way I\u2019d describe it is, I mean, like I think you all know the accounting rules on when you accrue things are pretty clear based upon, generally, when you know something or have a pretty good sense that something is going to be done and so it\u2019s probable, and you can put an estimate on it. And so as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve tried to be very, very transparent that there \u2013 that we do have things that will be lumpy, that could be significant. And it\u2019s in our best interest to get as much behind us as quickly as we possibly can. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve been trying to do, both with our work but also the financial impact of these things, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the quarter. John McDonald : Okay. And then maybe, Mike, I could follow-up on the non-op expense outlook for $12.3 million in the fourth quarter applies up from the $12.1 million this quarter. Maybe just some context of what\u2019s driving that? Is it seasonality? And then can we think of that jumping off point of the fourth quarter as the beginning of annualizing that for next year? And what would be the \u2013 roughly the puts and takes for thinking about next year from the fourth quarter? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No, thanks, John. And I think when you think about the change from third quarter to fourth quarter, it really is just some seasonal things. If you go back over a long period of time, you just see year-end accruals related to a bunch of different items that sort of end up in the fourth quarter, and so there is no story there other than that. I think we continue to be on track on the efficiency work that we laid out at the beginning of the year, and so you\u2019ll see some of that come through those numbers as well in there. As it relates to 2023, as Charlie said in his remarks, we will lay that out in more detail in January. John McDonald : Okay. Maybe a broader comment just on efficiency and where you are relative to your longer-term targets? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No, I think we\u2019re right on track on the plan that we laid out, John. And we said we would deliver about $3.3 billion of impact in 2022, and that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re on track to do that. As we \u2013 as Charlie and I both said a number of times, we\u2019re not done, and I think there is still more opportunity. And we\u2019re going through those conversations as we go through our budget process now, and continuing to unpick the onion around where there is more opportunity. So I think those \u2013 that program will continue to evolve, but we still feel we\u2019ve got more opportunity to drive incremental efficiency, and we\u2019re on track for the things we laid out. Charlie Scharf : And John, the only thing I would add, because I know it\u2019s on a lot of people\u2019s minds, is that \u2013 I mean, from our standpoint, there is nothing new in our thinking from what we\u2019ve talked about last quarter, both in terms of where the opportunities are and how we\u2019re thinking about the future. And we just do think that it makes sense when we get to the end of next quarter, when we talk about our path to a 15% sustainable through different cycles, ROTCE, that\u2019s also an opportunity to talk more specifically about expenses and how that fits in, including what it looks like for next year. And so by that point, we will have finished our budget process. We will understand all the puts and takes, and be in a really good position to talk about it. John McDonald : Got it. Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Thanks, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask broadly on NII. Once the Fed stops raising rates, can you sort of discuss broadly how and for how long you could maintain positive NII momentum? Mike Santomassimo : Well, Scott, I think there is a lot that needs to play out for us to answer that with any degree of accuracy, right, in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the economy, loan growth, what\u2019s happening with deposits and so forth. But the only thing I would point out that you do need to keep in mind as you think about it is there will be a lag on deposit pricing, and that happens in every cycle. It happened in the last cycle and will happen again here. Once the Fed stops raising rates, you will see a lag before deposit pricing stops going up, and that\u2019s just normal and to be expected. As it relates to overall NII at that point, I think there is a lot of what-ifs that need to go into that scenario. And as we all have seen, even over the last few days, some of those expectations continue to evolve. So \u2013 but I would keep in mind as you think about that, the deposit pricing lag. Scott Siefers : Yes. Okay. Makes sense. Thank you. And just returning to the operating losses for a second, just to help put the $2 billion in third quarter targeting context, just I guess, given the magnitude of charges that Wells had already taken, what \u2013 at this point, what is pushing those losses so high and what could keep them high going forward? And I guess I ask it within the backdrop of I know, like, you guys weren\u2019t really there when these issues took place. But just given how high they have been for so many years, just curious like what\u2019s keeping them at such a level? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Scott, this is Charlie. I\u2019ll take a shot at it, and Mike, feel free to pipe in. Listen, I think, again, if you go through things that we\u2019ve said in the past and go through our disclosures, we still have open regulatory matters that do relate to the past. We do have litigation that relates to a series of those things, which we do cover a lot of it in our disclosures. And the other thing which I just \u2013 as we continue to make progress and move forward and build the control environment, we do find things ourselves that do relate to the environment that we\u2019ve had in the past, and those things have to be remediated. So as I said earlier, we would like to get both \u2013 just both operationally and financially, things done as quickly as we can. The accounting rules dictate on when you \u2013 whether it\u2019s appropriate to take the charges, and we just, again, want to try and be as clear as we can. We are not surprised. I mean, when I say not surprised, we don\u2019t like the charge for sure. But it is just the reality of the position that we\u2019re in to get these things behind us, and try to be clear in the remarks that this isn\u2019t the end of it. But we would like to move as quickly as we can on everything that\u2019s remaining to get behind us. Scott Siefers : Okay. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And one thing overall. And I think even with these costs and the charges, we\u2019re continuing to make sure that we invest in the underlying businesses, too. I think Charlie highlighted a little bit of that in his remarks, but we\u2019ve got to keep making sure that we\u2019re adding people where we need to, we\u2019re building out the capabilities where we need to. And we\u2019ve talked some \u2013 about some of those opportunities in the past, but we are also doing that as well as executing on the efficiency agenda to make sure the earnings capacity of the company continues to get better. Scott Siefers : It helps. Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys, very much. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Ken Usdin : Thank you. Good morning, Charlie and Mike. Charlie, I want to ask you a follow-up on your comments about protecting your capital in an uncertain environment. Going back to the CCAR, when you correctly stated you\u2019ve got a lot of excess room, a lot of flexibility. Just wondering how you expect that CET1 to traject relative to where you want to keep it? And what does that mean in this environment for the prospects of doing share repurchase? Or do you just \u2013 is it a build in, just keep it and be protected environment? Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Maybe I\u2019ll start, Ken, and then Charlie can add anything. I think our thinking hasn\u2019t changed much since last quarter. We don\u2019t feel like we need to build from here. As you know, we\u2019ve got about 110 basis points of cushion over our reg minimum and buffers together. And I think as you sort of look at the environment we\u2019re in, we just \u2013 we want to be \u2013 continue to be prudent about how and when do we do buybacks. I think even if you think about the third quarter and look at the rate volatility we saw in the last 3 weeks of the quarter, and even in the last number of days of the fourth quarter now in the beginning, we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of volatility happening. And so it\u2019s just all of those things that go into the calculus we do every quarter to look at where the risks and opportunities are, and make sure that we\u2019re just being smart about managing it. Charlie Scharf : And the only thing I would add is I think, as Mike said, we feel very good about the growing earnings capacity of the company. And certainly, as we sit and look forward based upon what we actually see, we feel very good about the position that we\u2019re in. We just also \u2013 and in the most comments, trying to point out that when it comes to managing capital, we should be extremely conscious of what the risks are that are around us. There are swings in AOCI that have impacted many of us. There are these geopolitical risks out there which something could trigger something, which could ultimately have a broader impact on the economy. And those are all reasons just, given where we sit today, to be more conservative on capital rather than less conservative. And so a combination of those things with our own issues just lead us to say let\u2019s just see how those things play out. And that, for this environment that we\u2019re in, is probably the best use of that capital. Ken Usdin : Got it. And a follow-up just in terms of other uses of that capital, just in question. You did build the reserve a little bit this quarter and alluded to the potential for a greater uncertainty. Just \u2013 can you help us understand just where you live now in a scenario weightings in terms of your reserve? And Charlie, your point in your prepared remarks is just things might turn, but it\u2019s just unclear to say how. So how do you contemplate, how do we get a better sense of what that might mean for reserves, and how your view on potential losses has changed? Charlie Scharf : That\u2019s a hard one to answer. So when we set our \u2013 when we go through the process of set reserves, I think we do what everyone else does with the CECL calculations, which is we have a series of scenarios that we look at that are economically-driven based upon economists\u2019 view of what will happen to a series of variables that will impact our credit. We then go through and figure out what we think the right weighting is for those, depending on as we sit here in the environment, and then models produce a bunch of results. So there just \u2013 there is so many factors that go into it. There is a lot of signs behind it, but there is also a judgment that sits on top of it relative to how you weigh these things and whether the models are ultimately right. We think that, on a relative basis, just the way we think about things, to the extent you can build, you can be conservative, you\u2019re trying to be. But it\u2019s got to be fairly formulaically-driven. And I would say as we sit here today, we\u2019re not assuming \u2013 let me say differently. I think the comments that we\u2019re making about the risks in the environment factor into how we weight the different scenarios and so we do have weightings to the different downside scenarios. And I think that\u2019s [indiscernible]. Mike Santomassimo : And maybe I\u2019ll just add, we\u2019ve said this now for the last couple of quarters, we\u2019ve had a pretty significant weighting on the downside scenarios for a while and haven\u2019t changed that. I think you \u2013 if you look at what we\u2019ve built over the \u2013 during COVID, I guess, a couple of years ago now. Relative to where we are today, we haven\u2019t released all of that build that happened. And so all of what Charlie talked about goes into the conversation. And so at this point, we still feel very comfortable with where we are. Ken Usdin : Understood. Okay, thanks guys. Charlie Scharf : Yes. The only thing I want to just be clear about that is, again, we try and be \u2013 and you have to be forward-looking, and so we\u2019re trying to be very realistic about what potential outcomes are. But at the same time, if our view deteriorates on the level of risk out there, that could change. And so getting back to the capital comment, I do think it\u2019s kind of weird that this all runs through the income statement. And for that level, it\u2019s hard to predict. From our perspective, we do have to \u2013 the way we think about reserving and the way we think about capital are very much the same. Ken Usdin : Great. Thanks, again. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess just a quick follow-up around credit. I think from a fundamental standpoint, one, are there any areas in particular? I think you\u2019ve talked about seeing some weakness in Auto lending in the past. Are there any areas within the portfolio, seeing any signs of crack on credit or where you\u2019re being a little bit more careful in extending new lending? And also, if Charlie or Mike, if you can talk about just your exposure within the C&I book to the financial sponsors, how \u2013 your comfort level around that book, and whether any of that comes back to kind of create some credit volatility over the coming quarters? Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll think I\u2019ll start on the last piece. I think you\u2019re referring to leverage finance bridge, the bridge book? It\u2019s very immaterial in terms of any impact this quarter, so nothing \u2013 no story there in terms of anything significant in the quarter. As it relates a little bit more broadly on credit, for the most part, the portfolios are performing really well, right? And if you go look in the commercial bank, customers are still in really good shape on average, same thing in the corporate investment bank. On the consumer side, Charlie pointed out a lot of health indicators still look really good. We\u2019re not seeing systematic stress. You\u2019re certainly seeing a little bit more stress on the lower end, wealth spectrum, which is in a big part of the portfolio for us. And so overall, so far, so good in terms of the performance to date. Charlie Scharf : I would say, Ebrahim, that we\u2019re \u2013 we spend a lot of time on the wholesale side looking at inflation sensitive industries. As I mentioned in my remarks and just try and get ahead where we can, we don\u2019t see problems, but we\u2019re just trying to be very forward-looking. And on the consumer side, we\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re digging. We\u2019re digging through all of the information that we have to look for signs of stress. I think if you were to change the scale and like low the scales up significantly, you start to see very, very small impact on some payment rates. But we saw impacts to the lower-end consumers several quarters ago, and those haven\u2019t progressed as quickly as we would have thought. So, again, it\u2019s just \u2013 we don\u2019t have our heads in the sand. We sit here and we have listened to the Fed and take them at their word, and what they are doing is extremely powerful. And so things will slow, but we are just \u2013 we are trying to be prudent. And the only \u2013 and the last thing I would just say is some of our products, I would say, we are tightening up on the edges. Again, just to be prudent, some of the higher risk categories that have multiple risk layers to them. Not a big part of our production in any of our products, but just trying to be smart relative to who could be impacted. But at the same time, continuing to be in the markets and providing credit. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just a quick follow-up, Mike, what I was referring to on the C&I book is the disclosures around exposure to financials, except ex-banks. And so when I am thinking about like asset management, real estate finance, anything there that we should worry about in a world where there is some uncertainty around how private equity holds up in this environment of higher rates? That\u2019s what I was sort of getting at. Mike Santomassimo : Sorry. Yes. So, we \u2013 if you look at the Q, there is some breakdown of those exposures, and you can see that. And those \u2013 at this point, those are all performing really well, both in the asset-backed finance space as well as the subscription finance space. And so nothing to call out. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. On \u2013 I know you mentioned that you still see substantial opportunity on the efficiency side for improvement. And on that end, can you talk about the gross cost saves? I know you have increased the target from $8 billion to $10 billion this year, early this year in January. Can you talk about the potential that could that number move higher yet again as your \u2013 as you look at all the opportunities in front of you? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. John, look, I am sure we will provide more guidance on that or more disclosure on that in January, so I will leave any specific remarks there. But I would just go back to like what we have been saying, we are not done on the efficiency journey. As we execute on the stuff that\u2019s in front of us, we continue to find more opportunity really across most parts of the company, and so I think that will continue to evolve. John Pancari : Okay, Mike. Thanks. And then in terms of the mortgage expectation, I think you indicated that you could see some incremental downside pressure there. Can you maybe help us size up the magnitude that you could see in the fourth quarter in terms of an incremental decline? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Well, I mean if you look at the \u2013 in the Consumer Banking and Lending segment, we have got the mortgage banking income there. It\u2019s only a little over a $200 million [ph] for the quarter. So, even a relatively substantial percentage decline is a pretty small dollar decline these days given the run rate. But I think if you look at what happened this quarter, we probably came in a little bit better than what we guided in July. Spreads were a little bit better in August than what we had forecasted, but they came back down in September, and so we would expect that to continue. So, while I think there could be some downside there, it\u2019s off a pretty low run rate at this point. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. And then just one more follow-up on the balance sheet, and I am sorry if you had pointed to this already. But in terms of the pressure on the positive balances, can you talk about maybe how we should think about potential incremental declines in deposits as we see the impacts of the rate hikes continue to take hold? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I think one, I think you are going to continue to see pricing increase from here, as we have said now for a while. And so you will see pricing go up as rates continue to increase. And then on the deposit side, all of it is somewhat natural, right, given the environment we are in. So, as I pointed out in my remarks in the \u2013 we saw the biggest dollar decline in our wealth business, which is clients moving to higher-yielding cash alternatives. Now, we are also seeing more broadly, clients move into cash there in a couple of areas where we have seen cash alternatives grow substantially, not just as they migrate away from deposits. So, that\u2019s a piece of it. And then I think on the rest of the book, it\u2019s \u2013 what we are seeing on the consumer side is a lot of spending. Not as much people much \u2013 migrating away from us, or maybe there is a little bit of that, but it\u2019s really people out there spending. And then on the corporate investment bank, which are going to be some of your most rate-sensitive deposits, we are seeing the activity we expected to see, which is there are some clients moving into the other alternatives, but we still see many clients staying in cash with us as well. So, I would expect that there is going to be \u2013 there could be some further declines as we go. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thanks Mike. Appreciate the color. Operator : The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open miss. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Just another question on expenses, if I may. I guess the market \u2013 what the market is telling us today is that so long as the core expenses are as expected, the market seems to be looking through higher op losses. And as we look forward, Charlie and Mike, as you think about the budgeting process for next year, I think the Street expects operating losses to be improving to be a strong contributor to expense improvements going forward, even off of that original $1.3 billion expectation. I am just wondering, as you think about the budgeting, do you continue to contemplate adjustments on the core? Meaning, cutting core... Charlie Scharf : Operating losses or expenses, excluding operating losses, Erika? Erika Najarian : I meant expenses, excluding operating losses. I think your investors are expecting op losses to be down meaningfully even from that $1.3 billion original number. I am wondering if you are continuing to contemplate on the core? Charlie Scharf : Well, let me take a shot at it. I would say, again, first of all, I just want to remind you that we said in the prepared comments that we just want to be as transparent as we can, that we would \u2013 that it\u2019s quite possible. And we said, I think likely, highly likely that we will have more significant \u2013 potentially significant losses related to some of these historical matters. So, we just want that to be on the radar screen. No question, excluding that, our ops losses are still high, what I would just encourage people to think about is I personally wouldn\u2019t model them coming down until we actually see them coming down. Because again, as we go through and build the control environment, we are going to find things and we need to get that behind us. And I think that should be very much of a show me proposition, because again, we know what you know and we will see it when it happens. And we have done a little bit of advanced notice because we see all the work that we are doing, but we need to work through those things. And on the rest of op expenses, as we said, we are going to provide more specific guidance for that in the fourth quarter relative to next year, and also talk about how it plays into 15% sustainable ROTCE. And our budget, I also want to make the point because I think this is important to everyone. On the one hand, everyone wants \u2013 we all want our expenses to go down because of what it does to earnings. But we are extremely \u2013 I mean, even when we live in these two worlds, which is where we are rectifying these issues from the past, which are both building the risk and control work that\u2019s necessary and all the regulatory work and fixing the expense structure. But we also very much have no intention of falling behind in our businesses. And so the two paths of conversations that we have through the budget process is what are we investing in and where are we going to see efficiencies. And we obviously have to make sure that we are getting the appropriate amount from each of those categories. Overall, there is no question that our efficiency ratios are not where they want them to be. So, directionally, that just tells you how we are thinking about how \u2013 where that goes. But when we finish the process, we will provide more clarity, but just know that we are thinking about both sides of that equation. But understand what \u2013 where we should be more long-term. Erika Najarian : No, I think that makes sense. And I think the conversation with investors, Charlie, is sort of the next step for Wells Fargo in terms of accelerated investment spend, right? Efficiencies, obviously, a ratio, so that makes sense. And my follow-up question maybe is for you, Mike. So, I am squeezing two parts to my second question. The first is, could you tell us what unemployment ratio, your ACL ratio today contemplates? And second, if you could just give a comment on where you see deposit betas trending relative to your previous expectation now that we have added 100 basis points onto the expectation for Fed funds since we have talked to you last in the quarterly earnings setting? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Well, let me take the first one first. So, if you look at our Q, we do give you a kind of weighted blend of the economic scenarios and we give you a few data points, unemployment rate is one of them. As of the end of June, the weighted \u2013 actually, not the right one. The rated number for the end of this year was 4.1%, growing to 6% at the end of 2023. And we will update that based on the third quarter and the Q when we get there. On the second part of the question, what was the second \u2013 can you just repeat the second part? I am sorry about that. Erika Najarian : Deposit betas, has your thinking on cumulative [ph] deposit betas changed as we contemplated 2023, given that we added 100 basis points of the Fed\u2019s funds outlook since we spoke to you last in this quarterly earnings setting? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I think so far, the betas have played out the way we expected them to do at this point in the cycle. And I think as rates continue to go up, we would expect them to increase, and that was part of the playbook and the analysis we had done going into the environment. And so \u2013 and that\u2019s to be expected, right. And the if rates are going to go up even higher than we originally thought, then the betas will continue to go up with that. And so I think it\u2019s largely at this point playing out the way we thought it would. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open sir. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Can you give us an update on your rate positioning, and thoughts on whether you want to lock it in the kind of rate level that we are at here, what\u2019s expected, or how you are thinking about protecting yourselves from potentially lower rates, or what your perspective is on that? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I mean we still have \u2013 we are still asset sensitive as where we stand today, and so that will \u2013 we will continue to get the benefit as rates go up. But as you suggest, I think most banks are thinking about not just about today, but also about the other side of when rates start to peak and come back down. And I think the expectations around them have changed quite substantially. Certainly since the second quarter, but even throughout the third quarter into where we stand today, those expectations have changed a lot. So, I would say at this point, we are spending a lot of time thinking about that question and how we want to protect part of the balance sheet from when rates would start to decline. But we haven\u2019t done anything in a material way at this point. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Charlie Scharf : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Two questions. One, on loans, how should we think about how much more room there is for you to grow loans within the context of the asset cap, realizing that there is a constraint so you can\u2019t get to maybe the level as a percentage of total assets or total earning assets that you could before GFC? I know it\u2019s a long time ago, but I am just trying to understand what running room you think you have in the loan book to grow that? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Betsy, I think as we have said I think even last quarter, we have got room to continue to grow and be there for clients. And we have got levers to pull if and when we think we need to create more capacity to do that. And so at this point, we are comfortable that we are going to be able to continue to be there for clients. And there is always discretionary stuff that you can do in certain pockets of your loan portfolio, and so I think we have got \u2013 we feel comfortable at this point that we can still be there. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then separately on the AOCI pull to part, can you give us a sense as to what we should put in the model for how long that should take? Mike Santomassimo : How long \u2013 what part of that should take? Betsy Graseck : The underwater AFS book, right? Like if rates were flat with quarter end 3Q, you have got\u2026 Mike Santomassimo : When do you start to accrete back the AOCI? Betsy Graseck : Yes. How long does it take to accrete back the AOCI? Mike Santomassimo : It takes a while. So, you guys \u2013 I think we have mentioned \u2013 this just came up last quarter and the expectations really haven\u2019t sort of changed much, and it will take a while to come back. It will come slowly back year-by-year as the maturity of the bonds get shorter. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Alright. No, I was just wondering because we have seen some portfolio restructurings at other places and didn\u2019t know if you had put hedges on that would have changed the pace, because obviously, it\u2019s meaningful to the capital outlook. So, I am just wondering if there is any color there, but I guess not. Alright. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. Your line is open. Charles Peabody : I wanted to follow-up on the deposit beta question. As I am sure you are aware, Treasury is talking to the TBAC committee and trying to get some advice on a treasury buyback. I was curious what your thoughts are about how that would affect liquidity flows, potentially out of money market funds into the banking system, and therefore, how that might affect your deposit beta assumptions next year? Mike Santomassimo : I think cause an effect and how that will play into deposit betas would be a really hard question to answer. I mean that will \u2013 if that comes to bear, that will be one of like many different factors that will go into what to expect from deposit levels, and therefore, betas over time. So, I wouldn\u2019t attempt to try to put some math behind that at this point. Charles Peabody : But at the very least, would you view it as a net positive or in isolation, or is it a non-event in isolation? Mike Santomassimo : I mean it really depends on what it is and how big in size, and so I think it could be that full range. It could be a non-event or matter. But I think until you have better clarity, it\u2019s hard to say. Charles Peabody : And assuming it\u2019s a $1 trillion type of treasury buyback, which I think is the capacity they have? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I think it\u2019s just a really hard question to try to put math behind at this point. Charles Peabody : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open sir. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Charlie, Mike \u2013 Charlie, I wanted to just follow-up on your comment earlier about you are seeing declines in deposits before \u2013 below pre-pandemic levels in certain cohorts. Can you talk a little bit about that? What level of balances kind of cohorts are you talking about, and how much have they gone down below pre-pandemic levels? Charlie Scharf : Yes. I will turn it over to Mike. But I just \u2013 this is the same thing that we had talked about in the prior quarter whereas those that entered the pandemic with the lowest of balances to begin with, where they had balances for a period of time that remains above pre-pandemic levels, and we started to see declines ultimately in spend and deposit levels for that group now that are averaging below pre-pandemic levels. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we would have expected that. I would have expected that to exacerbate and spread, and it hasn\u2019t really. It\u2019s still a small part of our customer base. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And in fact, these are customers generally that have $500 or $1,000 or $2,000 kind of average balances per month, and there is a percentage of those customers that have seen some declines. And there is also a percentage \u2013 some of those customers that haven\u2019t, right. So, it is just one of the different cohorts we have looked at. But as Charlie said, that hasn\u2019t really started to go up in higher wealth cohorts or income cohorts. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And it sounded like from your comments that start \u2013 that decline has happened this quarter. So, I guess for the group that we are seeing, it probably gets worse as inflation remains high? Mike Santomassimo : No, this is a continuation of a trend we saw in second quarter as well. So, it\u2019s not necessarily accelerating in any way, but it\u2019s a continuation of a trend we have seen now for a number of months. Vivek Juneja : Mike, a little one for you. Card delinquencies, you gave 30 plus. Can you break that down to 30 days to 89 days of the early delinquencies, what those did this quarter? Mike Santomassimo : There will be more in the Q, I think we are back on that. Vivek Juneja : Okay. You don\u2019t \u2013 okay, the suggestion to just have it out at earnings because, obviously, given that we are starting to change environment, it\u2019s an important metric to keep an eye on. Thanks. Operator : The final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Sir, your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning Mike. Good morning Charlie. Mike, can you share with us the trends you are seeing in the commercial real estate area? You guys had very strong revenue growth, of course, in commercial real estate this quarter year-over-year. The commercial real estate mortgage balances were slightly down. But we are hearing from different folks that the commercial real estate market starting to tighten up, banks aren\u2019t as being as aggressive in lending. Can you \u2013 any color on the risk dynamics that you might be seeing and the trends you are seeing in commercial real estate mortgage? Mike Santomassimo : Sure. Let me start with just what\u2019s driving some of the growth you have seen, right. So, loan balances are up year-to-date and year-over-year. Really driven by two things, growth in multifamily, apartments, and some growth in some industrial properties. And so we still see really strong demand. I think even if you look at new housing, new multifamily housing starts, still growing. Hasn\u2019t really turned like single-family homes has over the last number of months, still \u2013 so really strong demand there. I think when you look at the performance of the portfolio, some of the categories that were most impacted by the pandemic hotels, retail. In most cases, are back. Good cash flow, values are fine, and we are seeing that hold up pretty well. You still have some forward-looking uncertainty in the office space, just given that hasn\u2019t really translated into significant stress yet because you still have long-term leases and other things. You always hear about an anecdotal issue of the property, but it has \u2013 nothing systematic yet rolling through the portfolio. I can\u2019t speak about what others are doing. But I think for us, you have seen good growth this year. And as you go into an uncertain environment, you are just \u2013 you are going to try to be smart about what you put on \u2013 new things you put on your balance sheet, and we continue to do that. But that\u2019s in the context of seeing some good growth year-to-date. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Obviously, your guys\u2019 CET1 ratio is well above your required level, and I think you pointed out your AOCI mark drew it down by about 21 basis points. Would you guys consider repositioning the available-for-sale portfolio since you are already taking the mark through your CET1 ratio? What kind of dynamics would you need to see if that would make sense for you to do that? Mike Santomassimo : You always look at \u2013 you have different ways to optimize. We did \u2013 we did do a little bit in the second quarter where we traded out some mortgage \u2013 blanking on the name, but some mortgage-backed securities for Ginnie Mae [ph], you get a little better RWA treatment. So, you do \u2013 we have done some little bit of repositioning over the time. And it\u2019s something we always sort of look at and think at. But it\u2019s not something that we are contemplating in big size at this point. Gerard Cassidy : Alright. Thank you. End of Q&A: Charlie Scharf : Alright. Thank you very much everyone. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Take care. Operator : Thank you all for your participation on today\u2019s conference call. At this time all parties may disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.  Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to come that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP final measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our fourth-quarter results, and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth-quarter results in more detail and some of our expectations for 2023 before we take your questions. Let me start with fourth-quarter highlights. Our results were significantly impacted by previously disclosed operating losses, but our underlying performance reflected the continued progress we're making to improve returns. Rising interest rates drove strong net interest income growth. Our continued progress and our efficiency initiatives helped to drive expenses lower excluding operating losses. Loans grew in both our commercial and consumer portfolios, and charge-offs have continued to increase but credit quality remains strong. Our capital levels also remained very strong. And our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6%, well above our required minimum plus buffers. We also continue to make progress on putting legacy issues behind us. Our broad reaching agreement with the CFPB in December is an important step forward that helps us resolve multiple matters, the majority of which have been outstanding for several years. Over the past three years, we have made significant changes in the businesses referenced in the settlement, and many of the required actions were already substantially complete prior to this announcement. While our risk and regulatory work hasn't always followed a straight line and we have more to do, we've made significant progress, and we will continue to prioritize our work here. In addition to our risk and regulatory work, it's also critical for us to continue to invest in the future as we build off the great market positions we have. We are confident our processes will enable us to continue to prioritize our risk and control work. At the same time, we invest in our future. And as I look back at '22, I'm enthusiastic about the progress we've made this past year and feel even better about the opportunities ahead. Let me start with the changes we've made during the year to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs. These efforts included the elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection, early payday making eligible direct deposits available up to two days early, extra-day grace, giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees. And in the fourth quarter, we launched Flex Loan, a new digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds. Teams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in record time. The rollout has been smooth and though it's still early, customer response is exceeding our expectations. These actions build on services we've introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking, our account with no overdraft fees. We now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago. We continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions. We continue to improve our credit card offerings including launching two new cards, Wells Fargo Autograph and BILT. Our new products helped drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022, while we continued to maintain strong credit profiles. We launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses, to provide a more comprehensive, relevant and integrated offering for our clients. We continue to enhance our partnership within our Commercial business to bring Corporate and Investment Banking products such as foreign exchange and M&A advisory services to our middle-market clients. Our different approach to technology is helping us better serve our consumer and corporate clients. We rolled out our new mobile app with a simpler, more intuitive user experience, which has improved customer satisfaction. In 2022, mobile active customers grew 4% from a year ago. We launched Intuitive Investor, making it easier for customers to invest with the streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investment. And total active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago. We completed the development of Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant that provides a more personalized, convenient, and simple banking experience, which is currently live for eligible employees and set to begin rolling out to customers early this year. Last month, we announced Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients. Vantage uses AI and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients' specific needs. Over the past year, our industry-leading API platform team continued the development of payment APIs for commercial and corporate clients invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients, ramps up in group product offerings in consumer lending and began developing commercial lending solutions. We are investing heavily in modernizing the IT infrastructure and the way we develop code. We're implementing a cloud-native operating model that allows us to innovate faster. We've also been investing in modernization in the areas of payments and corporate lending, taking out legacy applications and digitizing processes end to end. These enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of initiatives we have planned as part of our multiyear digital transformation. We also continue to evaluate our existing businesses. As we announced earlier this week, we plan to create a more focused Home Lending business aimed at serving primarily bank customers as well as individuals and families and minority communities. This includes exiting the correspondent business and reducing the size of our servicing portfolio. I'm saying for some time that the mortgage business has changed dramatically since the financial crisis, and we've been adjusting our strategy accordingly. We're focused on our customers, profitability, returns, and serving minority communities, not volume or market share. The mortgage product is important to our customer base and the communities we serve, so it will remain important to us, but we do not need to be one of the biggest originators or services -- servicers in the industry to do this effectively. Across all of our businesses, we must evolve as the market regulation and competition has evolved. And while it may seem counterintuitive, we believe the decision to reduce risk in the mortgage business by reducing size and narrowing our focus will actually -- this will actually enable us to serve customers better and will also improve our returns in the long term.  Changing gears now, I'm proud of all we did last year to make progress on our environmental, social, and governance work. We are balanced in our approach to these issues and believe that thinking broadly about our stakeholders will enhance returns to shareholders. And we provide many examples on Slide 2 of our presentation. So, let me just highlight two examples here. We published our first diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which highlights the progress that we've made on our DE&I initiatives. We'll continue to make progress in our commitment to integrating DE&I into every aspect of the company under the new leadership of Kristy Fercho, who joined Wells Fargo in 2023 to lead our Home Lending business and was named the company's new head of diverse segments, representation, and inclusion in the fourth quarter. We've commissioned an external third-party racial equity audit, and we plan to publish the results of the assessment by the end of this year. 2022 is a turning point in the economic cycle. The Federal Reserve has made clear that reducing inflation is its priority, and it will continue to take actions necessary to achieve its goal. We are starting to see the impact on consumer spend, credit, housing, and demands for goods and services. At this point, the impact to consumers and businesses has been manageable. And though there will certainly be some industries and segments of consumers that are more impacted than others, the rate impact we see in our customer base is not materially -- I'm sorry, the rate of impact we see in our customer base is not materially accelerating. This plus the strength with which consumers and businesses went into this slowing economy is a helpful set of facts as we look forward. Our customers have remained resilient with deposit balances, consumer spending and credit quality still stronger than pre-pandemic levels. As we look forward, we're carefully watching the impact of higher rates on our customers and expect to see deposit balances and credit quality continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels. While we're not predicting a severe downturn, we must be prepared for one, and we are stronger company today than one and two years ago. Our margins are wider, our returns are higher, we're better managed, and our capital position is strong, so we feel prepared for a downside scenario if we see broader deterioration than we currently see or predict. We still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as we make progress on our efficiency initiatives and continue to make the investments necessary to grow the business through technology and product enhancements. Two years ago, we shared a path to higher ROTCE by returning capital to our shareholders and executing on our efficiency initiatives. While high levels of operating losses in the second half of '22 impacted our results, our underlying business performance demonstrated our ability to improve our returns. In a moment, Mike will highlight the key drivers of our path to a 15% ROTCE, which we believe is achievable based on the strength of our business model and our ability to execute. While we're focused on improving our returns, making progress on building the appropriate risk and control and infrastructure for a company of our size and complexity will remain our top priority, and we will dedicate the time and resources necessary. I want to conclude by thanking our employees across the company who are working hard each day to continue to make progress in our transformation. I'm excited about all that we will accomplish in the year ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie. And good morning, everyone. Slides 2 and 3 summarize how we helped our customers, communities and employees last year, some of which Charlie covered. So, I'm going to start with our fourth-quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the fourth quarter was 2.9 billion, or $0.67, per diluted common share. Our fourth-quarter results included 3.3 billion, or $0.70, per share of operating losses primarily related to a variety of previously disclosed historical matters, including litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation. $1 billion of impairment of equity securities, or 749 million after noncontrolling interest, predominantly in our affiliated venture capital business, primarily driven by portfolio companies in the enterprise software sector. Both, slowing revenue growth rates and lower public market valuations of enterprise software companies impact the valuations. It's important to note that even after recognizing this impairment, the current value of these investments at the end of 2022 remained above the amount of the initial investment. $353 million of severance expense, primarily in Home Lending. While we've reduced headcount in this business throughout 2022, this charge includes the actions we plan to take in 2023 related to the mortgage announcement we made earlier this week. These reductions were partially offset by 510 million of discrete tax benefits related to interest and overpayments in prior years. We highlight capital on Slide 5. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6%, up approximately 30 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the benefit from our fourth-quarter earnings, the annual share issuance for our 401(k) plan matching contribution, and an increase from AOCI. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect. As a reminder, our G-SIB surcharge will not increase in 2023. While we have not repurchased any common stock since the first quarter of 2022, we currently expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of this year.  Turning to credit quality on Slide 7. Credit performance remained strong with 23 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows, and we expect them to continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels over time as the federal needs to take actions to combat high inflation. Credit performance remains strong across our commercial businesses with only 6 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Total consumer net charge-offs increased 88 million from the third quarter to 48 basis points of average loans, driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the Credit Card portfolio but remained slightly below consumer net charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2019. Nonperforming assets increased 1% from the third quarter as lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans were more than offset by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans. Our allowance for credit losses increased 397 million in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth, as well as a less favorable economic environment. We are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risk and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards. Let me highlight trends in two of our portfolios. The size of our Auto portfolios declined for three consecutive quarters, and balances were down 5% at the end of 2022 compared to year-end 2021. Meanwhile, originations were down 47% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago which reflected credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates. Of note, our new vehicle originations surpassed used vehicles in the fourth quarter, reflecting a combination of credit tightening actions that we've implemented and the industry dynamic of higher new vehicle sales growth.  Turning to the commercial real estate office portfolio. The office market is showing signs of weakness due to weak demand, driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance, as well as challenging economic and capital market conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to significant loss content yet, we do expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure and being disciplined in our underwriting standards with both, outstanding balances and credits down compared to a year ago. On Slide 8, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 3.1 billion from the third quarter. Period-end loans increased for the sixth consecutive quarter with growth across our commercial portfolios and higher consumer loans driven by credit card and residential loans, partially offset by continued declines in our Auto portfolio. I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 181 basis points from a year ago and 85 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher rate environment. Average deposits declined 6% from a year ago and 2% from the third quarter. Compared with the third quarter, we saw declines in each of our business. Lower consumer balances reflected customers continuing to reallocate cash in higher-yielding alternatives, particularly in Wealth and Investment Management and continued consumer spending. As expected, our average deposit cost increased 32 basis points from the third quarter to 46 basis points, driven by higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Average deposit costs are up 44 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021, while market rates have increased substantially more during that same time. As rates continue to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase in customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products to continue.  Turning to net interest income on Slide 9. Fourth-quarter net interest income was 13.4 billion, which was 45% higher than a year ago, as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. I'll provide details on our 2023 expectations later on the call. Turning to expenses on Slide 10. The increase in noninterest expense from both, a year ago and from the third quarter was driven by higher operating losses. Excluding operating losses, other noninterest expense was flat from a year ago as higher severance expense was offset by lower revenue-related compensation and continued progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our operating losses in the fourth quarter included accruals related to the December 2022 CFPB consent order. As part of that settlement, we agreed to one incremental remediation and one new remediation related to overdraft fees. The accrual related to these two remediations was approximately 350 million. Our operating losses in the fourth quarter also included accruals for other legal actions. And reflecting these accruals, our current estimate of the high end of the range of reasonably possible losses and accessible for legal actions as of December 31, 2022, is approximately 1.4 billion. This is down approximately 2.3 billion from September 30, 2022. While we still have outstanding litigation resolved, this estimate would be the lowest level since the second quarter of 2016, though, of course, new matters will arise and existing matters will develop over time. The estimate for December 31, 2022, will be updated at the time of our 10-K filing in February and may change. While we acknowledge the elevated level of operating losses, the past two quarters has been significant. They are important steps in putting historical issues behind us as we've been able to absorb the cost while increasing our CET1 ratio as I highlighted earlier.  Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 36% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates. Deposit-related fees continued to decline as we completed the rollout of the overdraft fee reductions and new product enhancements that we announced early last year to help customers avoid overdraft fees. The majority of the revenue impact of these changes was reflected in the fourth-quarter run rate. We continue to focus on branch rationalization as digital adoption and usage among our customers have steadily increased. In 2022, we reduced branches by 179 and branch staffing levels by 10%, and we expect to continue to optimize our branches and staffing levels in response to changing customer needs. While industry mortgage rates declined in the fourth quarter, they were still up over 330 basis points since the beginning of the year, and weekly mortgage applications as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association were at a 26-year low at quarter end. The economic incentive to refinance is extremely limited. And refinance applications for the industry were down 87% in December compared to a year ago. Reflecting these market conditions, our Home Lending revenue declined 57% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and gain-on sale margins, as well as lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. We expect the mortgage origination market will continue to be challenging and gain-on sale margin or remain under pressure until excess capacity industry has been removed. As we announced this week, we will be exiting our correspondent business, which we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter. We don't expect this action to have a significant impact on our 2023 financial results. Credit Card revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point of sale volume and new product launches. Auto revenue declined 12% from the year ago driven by continued loan spread compression from rising rates and credit tightening actions in certain areas, as well as lower loan balances. Personal Lending was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by lower spread compression. While originations grew 19% from the year ago driven by strong consumer demand in investments and the business, we have remained disciplined in our underwriting. Turning to key business drivers on Slide 12. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 32% from the third quarter, with both declines in correspondent and retail and originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations were over half of our volume a year ago to -- declined to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2022. I already highlighted the drivers of the decline in Auto originations. So, turning to debit card. Spending was up 1% compared to a year ago. Holiday spend for debit card was flat compared to the 2021 season with lower transaction volume, offset by higher average ticket size. Entertainment was the only category with double-digit spending while growth -- while categories such as home improvement, general retail goods, and fuel were all down compared to 2021. Credit Card spending increased 17% from a year ago, and while the year-over-year growth rate slowed from the third quarter. Almost all categories continue to have double-digit growth. Average balances were up 22% from a year ago. Payment rates have started to moderate, but we're still well above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle market banking revenue increased 78% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net gains from equity securities, partially offset by loan growth. Average loan balances were up 18% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, while growth in the first half of 2022 was driven by higher realization. Utilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year. Average loan balances have grown for six consecutive quarters and were up 5% in the third quarter, with growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory, which are still below pre-pandemic levels. Growth in middle market banking was driven by larger clients, including both, new and existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller customers.  Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 22% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results due to the impact of higher interest rates, as well as improved lending results. Investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all products and industries. Commercial real estate revenue grew 16% from a year ago driven by stronger lending results to a higher loan balances and the impact of higher interest rates. Markets revenues increased 17% from a year ago, driven by higher trading revenue in equities, rates and commodities, foreign exchange, and municipal products. Average loans grew 10% from a year ago after growing for seventh consecutive quarter, average loans declined from the third quarter as utilization rates stabilized across most portfolios. On Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was up 1% compared to a year ago, as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates was partially offset by lower asset-based fees due to the decrease in market valuations. The majority of win in advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so asset-based increased slightly in the first quarter, reflecting the higher market valuations at the end of the year. Expenses decreased 6% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives. Even as loan growth in securities-based lending moderated due to demand caused by market volatility in the interest rate environment, average loans grew 1% from a year ago. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Both revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our Corporate Trust business in Wells Fargo Asset Management. We sold these businesses in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in a net gain of 943 million. Revenue also declined from a year ago due to lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, including the impairments in equity securities I highlighted earlier. The increase in expenses from a year ago was driven by higher operating losses.  Turning to our expectations for '23, starting with Slide 17. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income. We are assuming that -- we are assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Moving from left to right on the waterfall, based on the current forward rate curve, we expect our net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates, even with deposits repricing faster than they did in 2022. However, this benefit is expected to be partially offset by continued deposit runoff and mix shift to higher-yielding products with these declines, partially offset by modest loan growth. We also expect a headwind for lower CIB Markets net interest income due to higher funding costs. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in trading gains and noninterest income, so the impact to revenue is currently expected to be small. Putting this all together, we currently expect net interest income to grow by approximately 10% in 2023 versus 2022. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned in 2023 will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix, and pricing in the loan demand.  Turning to our 2023 expense outlook on Slide 18. Following the waterfall from left to right, we reported 57.3 billion in noninterest expense in 2022, which included 7 billion of operating losses. Excluding operating losses, expenses would have been 50.3 billion, which is -- which was in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of last year. If you also exclude operating losses from the guidance, our 2022 expenses were impacted by inflation and higher severance expense. However, revenue-related expenses were lower than expected by market conditions. So, we believe a good starting point for discussion of 2023 expenses was 50.3 billion, which excludes operating losses. We expect expenses in 2023 to increase by approximately $1 billion due to both, merit increases, including inflationary pressures and an approximately $250 million increase in FDIC expense related to the previously announced surcharge. These increases are expected to be partially offset by approximately 100 million of lower revenue-related expense, primarily driven by decreases in loan lending. Based on current market levels, we expect revenue-related expense in Wealth and Investment Management for 2023 to be similar to 2022. We've successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately 7.5 billion of gross expense saves over the past two years. And through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize an additional 3.2 billion of gross expense reductions in 2023. A piece of this is related to the announcement we made earlier this week to create a more focused Home Lending business, but expense savings from reducing our servicing business will take more time to be realized. We highlighted on this slide the largest opportunities for additional savings this year, and we believe we'll have more opportunities beyond 2023. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work separate from our efficiency initiatives. And we will continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work. And while we continue to focus on executing our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to invest and expect approximately 1.7 billion of incremental investments in our businesses in 2023. As Charlie discussed, investing in our businesses is critical to our growth across the company and better serve our customers, but we'll also continue to be thoughtful and evaluate the level of investments throughout the year. So, putting this all together, expenses, excluding operating losses, are expected to be relatively flat in 2023 compared with 2022, even with inflationary pressures, a higher FDI surcharge, and increase incremental investments in our businesses. As 2022 demonstrated, operating losses can be significant and hard to predict, and therefore, we have not included them in our expense outlook for 2023. However, we currently anticipate ongoing business-related operating losses, such as fraud, theft, and other business-as-usual losses to be approximately 1.3 billion this year, which is the same assumption we provided last year. As previously disclosed, we had an outstanding litigation -- have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact the amount of operating losses. It's important to note that while we made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. This remains a multiyear process with the goal of achieving an efficiency ratio along with our peers based on our business mix. Given how critical continuing to invest to our -- continue to invest in our story, on Slide 19, we provide details on our primary areas of focus for 2023. As we've highlighted, continuing to build the right risk and control of infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the investments we started to make in digital payments, and we plan to continue to invest in these areas this year to make improvements for both our consumer and commercial customers. We also plan to continue to invest to expand our client coverage and investment banking, Commercial Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management and to continue to transform our technology platforms, including moving more applications to cloud, consolidating our data centers, and increasing investments in cyber. Finally, by investing in our operations and branches, we expect not only to improve the customer experience, but also improve efficiency, reduce operational risk, and drive and account growth. As we show on Slide 20, in the fourth quarter, we reported an 8% ROTCE. But as I highlighted at the start of the call, our fourth-quarter results were impacted by several notable items, including higher operating losses, elevated impairments of equity securities, severance, and discrete tax benefits. As we show on this slide, you will -- if you exclude these notable items, our fourth-quarter ROTCE would have been approximately 16%. However, we don't believe this accurately reflects our longer-term expectations for the following reasons. Net interest income was higher than our long-term expectations due to interest rates, funding, penalties, mix, and pricing, Also, net loan charge-offs were at historically low levels. If rates, funding balances, mix, and pricing were closer to our long-term expectations and charge-offs were higher, our ROTCE would be lower. Depending on what adjustments you make here, we may all get to a slightly different answer. So, to be clear, because the interest rates are higher and freight costs are lower than our longer-term expectations, we believe we have more work to do to improve our returns. On Slide 21, we highlight our path to higher returns. Since we first discussed our ROTCE goal in the earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2020, we have executed on a number of important items. We executed a $20 billion of gross common stock repurchases, 16 billion in net issuances, including our 401(k) plan. We increased our common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.30 per share. We delivered approximately 7.5 billion of gross expense saves and reduced headcount by 11% since the end of 2020. So, we've made good progress over the past two years on things that we can control, and we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher-returning products and businesses. Adding more focus on our Home Lending business should also be a positive contributor to higher returns. We also have additional opportunities to execute on efficiency initiatives. Additionally, we expect to benefit from the investments we are planning in our businesses, which I highlighted earlier. While some of these investments will be dependent on the market environment, we expect them to increase ROTCE. At the same time, we will continue to prioritize building our risk and control infrastructure. In the longer term, we believe that running a company in a more controlled and disciplined manner will continue to benefit returns. And our goal is for our four operating segments to produce returns comparable to our best peers. In summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in the fourth quarter significantly impacted our results, the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect an improvement in our earnings capacity. As we look forward, we expect to continue to grow net interest income. And our expenses, excluding operating losses, are expected to be relatively flat even after inflation and incremental investments in our businesses to drive growth. Both our credit performance and capital levels remained strong in the fourth quarter. And we expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Please stand by for our first question. Our first question of today will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon, I should say. Mike, just a follow-up on the NII outlook for the year. So, you obviously had a good high end to the year at 13.5% FTE. And just looking at what the guide implies a step down -- a little bit of a step down from thereafter, can you just kind of walk us through just how you expect the betas to move through and then like what doesn't necessarily follow through from here in terms of some of the moving parts? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Sure, Ken. Thanks for the question. I'll just kind of walk you through some of the drivers there. And then, obviously, also the timing of when we expect to realize some of those matters as well. And so, as you look at the key things, you look at stick loan growth, we've got -- we're expecting kind of low to mid-single-digit loan growth throughout the year. So, not superfast pace, but at a moderate pace of loan growth. We are expecting some moderate declines across the deposit base stabilizing later in the year, but some moderate declines as we look over the next few quarters. And then we would expect the betas to continue to move up a little from here. And then when you think about the pacing of it, the first half of the year will certainly be higher than the second half of the year if all of these things play out. And so, you shouldn't expect a really big step down in the first quarter for sure. And then I think that provides the opportunity potentially in the second half of the year if things -- if we don't see that step down in deposits or the betas are a little bit better than what we expected. And then I'd just point out is even as we looked at the fourth quarter, betas were a little bit better than what we had modeled. And so, we're all in a little bit of uncharted territory here, but I do think that there's some opportunity potentially in the second half of the year as we look at the forecast, but it will be dependent upon how we fare over the next quarter or two. Kenneth Usdin : Okay. Got it. And so, second question, I heard your commentary about the 1.3 billion of op losses and the fact that the RPO is down to way down to 1.4 billion. Just how do you kind of help us understand your range of confidence? Obviously, last year, op losses ended at 7 billion as you made progress. So, how wide the range of expectations around your confidence on that level of op loss for the year? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I think if you look at what we've said over the last quarter or two, there's been roughly in the third and fourth quarter 200, 250 just BAU op losses that have happened, just broad normal stuff that you should expect to continue. So, that gives you sort of a bottom end. And then I think the rest of it is -- will be a little dependent upon how we work through the rest of the issues that we've got to work through for next year. But I think as you look at the RPL going from 3.7 billion to 1.4 billion, as those big items have moved to be more probable and estimable for us, we booked them. And hopefully, that gives you confidence that we're putting some of the big things behind us. But we still have stuff to work through, and there'll be more over time, I'm sure. But we've put a lot of big things behind us. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Thank you for taking the question. I think maybe a question along the same lines there. So, the tone around the regulatory issue certainly sounds better than like 90 days ago and that reasonably possible losses seems to have a better quantitative thinking as well. But what -- maybe, Charlie, what are the major touch points sort of on your plate right now? I know all roads ultimately lead to lifting of the asset cap, but maybe would be curious to hear your thoughts on just sort of the biggest things left in your mind. Charles Scharf : Yes. Well, let me just -- so, listen, we still have a series of consent orders, of which, and I always point this out, the asset cap is a piece of one of them. So, all roads don't lead to the asset cap. The roads in this respect lead to us building the proper control environment, which will satisfy ultimately all the consent orders. And I've tried to be clear that we are making progress on that work. It is a lot to do. And our tone hasn't changed relative to the confidence in the progress that we're making there. So, we're going to continue doing it. And hopefully, it's done to the satisfaction of the regulators, but they'll have to decide that. And as we continue to tick off the to-dos on that work, the control environment gets better and better. And we become a better run company that doesn't have those kinds of operating losses that you've both seen in the past. Scott Siefers : Okay. All right. Perfect. And then, Mike, when you talk about resuming share repurchases in the first quarter, maybe you can give us sort of a sense for sort of magnitude and maybe just an even higher level, sort of how you get comfortable repurchasing in the face of what same sort of still uncertain rules out there. Mike Santomassimo : Well, I would start with where our CET1 ratio is at the end of the year at 10.6%. So, we're well above our current regulatory minimum and the buffers that are included there. So, we have plenty of flexibility regardless of any outcome that comes out of the new rules that will be proposed. And keep in mind, that will take some time to come out and get implemented and phase in. And so, there's -- it's not going to happen in a day. And I think we'll go back to what we've been saying the last number of quarters as we think about the buffer that we'll put on the reg minimum, buffers of 9.2%, we'll be managing somewhere in the 100, plus or minus, a little basis point range. And depending on what happens with loan growth and RWA growth that we see in the quarter, that will help guide the share repurchases. Operator : The next question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open. John McDonald : Hey, Mike, I wanted to clarify your answer to Ken, about the first quarter NII. I think you said you do not expect a big step down in the first quarter. Maybe you could just frame first quarter NII a little bit for us relative to the 13.4. What are some of the headwinds, tailwinds? And what might you expect at this point? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Thanks, John. Well, first, you have to normalize for a couple less days in the quarter. So, that's going to be a step down of, call it, 150 million to 200 million step down just there from the flex days. And then as you look at -- it should be relatively stable to the fourth quarter, but there could be some -- little bit of wiggle room in there. John McDonald : Stable minus including the day count or\u2026 Mike Santomassimo : You got to take the day count -- adjust for the day count. John McDonald : And then stable. Charles Scharf : You have to -- reducing for the day count. Yes. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. And then, Charlie, maybe a bigger question, just kind of where are you on the efficiency journey when we think about 50 billion of core expense for this year. And the timeframe for ROTCE, what will it take? Is there an efficiency ratio we should keep in mind? Or is that too hard to forecast? Maybe a little bit on that would be helpful. Charles Scharf : No, it's a good question. I think -- so, first of all, I think when -- just make a -- just a couple of comments around the expense guidance we gave. Embedded in that expense guidance, we're still continuing to reduce the core expenses of the company. But as you can see on that slide, we're anticipating that we will spend more money on investments that are around technology, digital, building out products, and things like that, that offset that some extent to get to an overall flat expense base. Mike did say in his comments, and I just want to repeat it, that we're not going to spend this money at all costs. We're going to see how the year continues to pan out. It's money that we would like to spend. We're planning to spend it, but there's a lot of discretion in the expense base. So, we think it's prudent, as we sit here today, to plan to spend it, but we're going to constantly be looking at our performance and make judgments on what that should be. And so, as we look at the efficiency of the company, we do expect to continue to get efficiency ratio improvement in the place. And if we don't see revenue growth and if we don't see payoffs from the things that we're doing, then we will spend less money. And so, that's the way we're approaching it. We're either going to get the efficiency ratio to continue to improve because we're getting real payoff on some things, or we will reduce on a net basis. But overall, there's still gross expenses that should come out of the company, which gives us the latitude to continue to grow the investments inside the company. The timing to get to 15%, listen, it's a great question. As we talked about it, it's medium term, which is obviously not long term or short term. But I would say it's -- without putting a specific time frame, it is -- it should be something that we have in our sights as we look out over the future. It's not something that's theoretical. It's something that we believe we should get to. And just the problem and we're just trying to stay a little bit away from, quantifying exactly where we're starting from just because everyone will make their own adjustments. And it's just -- I think what we're just trying to do is be really clear that we don't want to take credit for the outperformance in NII. We don't want to take credit for the outperformance in charge-offs, and that we still have to continue to drive improved performance each and every year at the company. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good afternoon. So, Charlie, I was hoping to ask a follow-up to that last line of questioning around expenses. You indicated that the expense work, it's going to continue beyond 2023. And the one metric that we've been tracking is headcount. And in terms of the benchmarking analysis that we've done, headcount is down more than 10% since the 2020 peek or roughly 30,000, but it's still elevated versus your money center peers. I was hoping you could just speak to what inning you're in currently in terms of optimizing headcount. And whether -- as we look beyond '23, whether there is a credible path to actually driving investments lower, you had talked about balancing investment with the need to drive those efficiency gains. I just want to think about the expense trajectory beyond '23, whether further reductions are achievable given some of that inflated headcount still? Charles Scharf : Yes. Listen, I think -- I mean, I think that your point on headcount versus peers is one that we've made. And so, yes, we are all different in terms of the businesses that we're in and what we do. But we do -- and some insource and some outsourcing things. But when you look at it, we still have higher headcount and higher expenses than people who are more complex than us. You know, some of that is explained by the work that we're doing and the expenses and heads that are building out the control infrastructure, but there's a lot more beyond that. That's the work that we're doing to peel that back piece by piece by piece. We still have a huge amount of manual processes inside the company. We have duplicate systems, and that is -- that's the work that we're on. So, when I say that we still have gross expenses to be reduced in the company, we -- there's -- that's exactly what we're talking about. On the -- the question is when we get to a net basis, where does that come out? As I said before, I think that's a decision that we want to be able to make at each and every point in time when we look at what the overall performance of the company is. So, again, I just want to repeat what I said. We're not going to spend under any environment at all costs. That's not the way we're thinking about it. If we don't see net improvements in performance of the company, we've got the ability to ration back the discretionary spend so that we do continue to see improved performance of the company. What we'd like to see is that these things are paying off. We're seeing real sustainable revenue growth based upon these things and the ability to invest. And so, that's just kind of how -- that's the framework that we're using to make the decisions. And as we get to each point in time, and it's not even just an annual decision. I mean, Mike and I and the operating committee are going to have these discussions regularly about how are things panning out, what does it look like, and how do we feel about our willingness to continue to invest in these things? And have it -- it's got to be living and breathing. Steven Chubak : That's helpful color, Charlie. And for my follow-up, just also as it relates to the discussion around the buyback. You guys are uniquely positioned in that you aren't migrating into a higher G-SIB bucket. Because of the asset cap, you're not going to necessarily see quite as much expansion in terms of balance sheet. And you've conveyed a high level of confidence around a 15% ROTCE, where your stock is trading today, at least on price intangible, reflects a pretty healthy degree of skepticism and your ability to get there. Just given the strength of your capital position, why not get a bit more aggressive with the buyback here? Just recognizing the significant amount of capital you'll generate, some of the concerns around AOCI seem to be abating. Would be helpful to get some perspective as to whether you might be willing to step it up meaningfully closer to 100% type payout here? Charles Scharf : Well, so just -- it sounds like you're drawing conclusions to the pace at which we said we're going to buy stock back, which I don't think we have actually said. What we've said is that we haven't been buying stock back. We're absolutely -- we anticipate we're going to begin buying it back. As we think about how much we have available in that capacity, what Mike said was our CET1 went up to 10.6%. Our required minimum buffers are at 9.2%. And we -- it said that we'll manage 100 basis points above the 9.2% plus or minus. So, we do have substantial capacity but the ongoing earnings capacity of the company. And so, that is -- that's -- our framework is to target a reasonable CET1 ratio. If in the future to raise the levels of capital because of Basel III in-game or whatnot, we've got earnings capacity to be able to do that. But we do have the flexibility. And now that we've got resolution with CFPB and things like that, to be able to go buy stock back. And we'll be making that decision based upon our views on the value of the stock and liquidity in the market and things like that. But as we said, we do anticipate we'll be back in -- as opposed to where we've been. Steven Chubak : Okay. Fair enough. More of my effort to assess the cadence and the magnet, but it sounds like you guys are quite comfortable leaning in here. So, thanks for taking my questions. Charles Scharf : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good afternoon. I wanted to see if you could just give a little bit more color on the net interest income side. Maybe if you can talk a little bit more about the noninterest-bearing deposit mix shift that you think could continue here. It looks like that could be a pretty material offset to your interest rate benefits. So, I just wanted to see if you can perhaps talk about that and then maybe also help quantify the runoff that you expect to continue on the deposit side in terms of balances overall. Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. John, it's Mike. I think overall, as I said earlier, we do expect a moderate decline in balances and some more mix shift changes as we go throughout the year. And so, you should expect that to continue. And it's all the stuff that should be expected as we're in this environment, and that's what we're seeing. And if you look at each of the businesses, we're seeing it kind of most acutely happen in the wealth business as people move into cash alternatives, out of deposits, and that's what's happening in a lot of wealth management businesses these days as people move that cash around. And then across the rest of the consumer businesses, it's part people looking for higher yields, but it's also part people spending more. And so, you're seeing some of that decline come down as overall balances continue to decline as the stimulus has worn off and people continue to be out there spending. So, it's a little bit of a number of drivers there. And I think as I said earlier, the -- as you think about the NII pacing for this year, this first half of the year will certainly be higher than the second half of the year, given the trends that we expect to happen. And if those are a little bit better than what we're modeling, then I think that provides some opportunity as we look at the second half of the year. John Pancari : Okay, Mike. Thank you. That's helpful. And then separately, you gave some pretty good color obviously, around NII expectations now. And then also on expenses. On the fee side, can you perhaps give us your expectation there around overall growth that you expect in noninterest income and maybe some of the major drivers of where you see growth and if you could possibly size it up perhaps around the investment banking area, etc.? That would help. Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Sure. And so, as you break apart fees, the biggest line item there is the investment advisory fees, and that's going to be somewhat dependent upon where the market goes. So, if we start to see recovery in the equity markets at a more substantial pace, that will obviously be a big benefit for that business. When you look at some of the other line items, deposit fees, as I mentioned in my commentary, most of the decline that we were expecting to see as a result of the overdraft policy changes and new products that we implemented is in the run rate. You may see some pressure there related to earnings credit on the commercial side, but the run rate decline for overdrafts is really in there. When you think about investment banking fees, that's going to be somewhat market dependent. We've seen -- it's too early to know how that's going to shape up in terms of the overall industry volume there. But as we continue to make the investments in our investment banking business over a longer period of time, we would expect to see some growth there, both in how we go after that opportunity in the commercial bank and middle market space, as well as our other large corporate clients there. And so, a lot of that's going to be dependent on the market. But we're confident that we're going to be positioning ourselves better and better to take advantage of it. And then we talked about mortgage. Mortgage is a small piece of the -- it's a much smaller piece of the puzzle than it was today. So, we don't expect that to be\u2026 Charles Scharf : A smaller piece today than it was historically. Mike Santomassimo : Sorry. Smaller piece today than it was historically. And so -- and that's going to be a pretty challenging market until -- in this rate environment. So, I think we're confident in the investments we're making that will pay off over time, but it may take a little time to start to see some of that come through depending on the market dynamics. Operator : The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good afternoon. I just have one question. I guess, Charlie, in your opening remarks, you mentioned that the impact on customers from higher rates, I think you implied was not getting worse with the incremental sales. Was that the right takeaway? And if so, and if the Fed were to stop after another hike, do you actually see that the impact your customers may not be as meaningful as feared over the last six to 12 months and implications of that on the credit quality and the credit performance of your book? Would love to hear any perspective you can share. Charles Scharf : Sure. What I was trying to say in those remarks was the impact on rising rates is continuing to impact customers on a period-over-period basis, and we would expect that to continue, but it's not accelerating. It's much more linear than exponential. And the fact that it's much more linear is actually a very helpful thing because that gives people -- that's just -- that's a more orderly transition to a slower growth economy and gives consumers a chance. It shows that they're adjusting their spending patterns and saving patterns and borrowing patterns to adjust for the reality of higher rates. And on your second question, we would anticipate that we would continue to see deterioration in those metrics continue after the Fed stops raising rates, for a period just because of the amount of time that it takes those things to filter through the economy more broadly. So, hopefully, that was helpful. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. I think you mentioned earlier around commercial real estate. Like are you seeing any stress? There some discussion around the ability of these loans to get refied given the move in rates we've seen over the last year. Any steps within the CRE book? And anything just in terms of home state, a lot of negative headlines around San Francisco. Would love to your perspective on that, too. Mike Santomassimo : It's Mike. I'll try to take that and Charlie can add if he needs. When you look at the -- and you're really getting at the office, I think, space more than anything there. There's certainly more stress in the office space than there was a quarter or two or three quarters ago. And I think you're seeing that. Now, it hasn't translated into lost content at this point. And so, we're keeping a careful eye on it. And I think it is -- as you look at where you see it most, it is in older, lower-class properties. And over 80% of our portfolio is in Class A space. And so, we feel like the quality of it's pretty good, but we will see some stress as we go through here. So far, it's been pretty idiosyncratic in terms of individual buildings and individual places. But we are very watchful on cities like San Francisco, like Los Angeles, like Washington, D.C., where you're seeing lease rates overall be much lower than other cities across the country. And so, certainly, those are markets that we're keeping a pretty close eye on and making sure we're being proactive with our borrowers to make sure we're thinking way ahead of any maturities or extensions, options that need to get put in place to help manage through it. Operator : The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good afternoon. Just one more clarification question, if I may, on net interest income. You know, Mike, your underlying assumptions to your NII outlook in terms of low to mid-single-digit loan growth, moderate declines in deposit balances in the first half and stabilizing, it doesn't feel very different from what consensus had been assuming to get to 51.5 billion for '23, which is clearly higher than what's implied by your outlook. So, I'm wondering if I could reask Ken's question, what deposit betas, what terminal deposit betas, what range of expectations are you baking into that 49.5 billion forecast? And did you make a significant amount of conservatism as you think about your NII outlook? And I'm asking that question because one of your peer CEOs said their 74 billion outlook was not conservative. So, I think that given the outlook versus consensus expectations, I did have to reask that question here. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No, look, it's\u2026 Charles Scharf : Can I just ask to start before Mike actually goes to the facts? Again, I think one of the things that you're hearing from all of us that were all very consistent on, which I know you appreciate, but I just want to say it anyway, is we don't know what the rate path is going to look like from here over the next 11.5 months, which is exactly what you're asking and exactly what the competitive environment is going to be month by month versus all of the people we compete with. So, you're looking at -- we don't know what the alternative is going to be in nonbank deposits, and we don't know what the alternatives are going to be in bank deposits, but we're trying to make those predictions. So, I think when we go through all of this, we're all just trying to, in our own way, make sure that there's clarity that we're -- and I'll speak to myself now. We're trying to give you what we think is achievable. And in our case, based upon the rate curve that we've laid out in the document, and it might or might not turn out that way. We're also assuming, and I talked about this at a conference in December that we are going to continue to raise rates in which we pay our consumers because we're thinking about this not in terms of maximizing short-term NII, but thinking about it in terms of the value of the relationship and making sure that we pay properly for that, so that we're continuing to recognize how expensive it is to get a new relationship and how profitable it can be to keep an existing relationship. And so if your views are different toward the end of the year as to what the rent scenario could be, that's fine. Specifically, what we've tried to do, as we've gotten closer to the periods with which we see is give you some clarity as Mike did on what we're -- the first quarter is a little clearer to us. But beyond that, is pretty difficult, and we're not going to go through every last beta that we're assuming in terms of what those forecasts are. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. The only thing I'd add to it is as you -- as the Fed does -- when the Fed does ultimately peak in terms of rising rates, you will see a lag on pricing as that will continue -- pricing will continue to increase over a quarter or two quarters, three quarters. Really, it all depends on the competitive environment. So, you're going to have some lag there. But I'm sure all of us have our own points of view and assumptions underneath those models. But what we're trying to give you, as Charlie said, is a case that we think is achievable through the year. And as I said earlier on the call, I think if we're -- if we've -- depending on how it plays out over the first and second quarter, we could have some opportunity in the second half. But I think it's unclear exactly how that will play out. So, we'll obviously keep you updated as it goes. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : I did want to just unpack a couple of things around the correspondent exit and also some follow-up questions as it relates to the mortgage business in general there. I think you mentioned that it's not substantial impact. Maybe you could help us understand revenues, expenses, EPS. I made my own assumptions, but I got a lot of questions from people on what managements say. So, I would like to understand that piece of it. And then could you help us understand how you're thinking about the mortgage business once you exit correspondent, is there any originate and sell servicing retained left in any panel? Or are you staying with this correspondent exit -- your exit that you'll be moving entirely to portfolioing for yourself, and the MSR will wind down over time? Just give us some color around that. It would be appreciated. Thanks. Charles Scharf : Yes. So, maybe I'll start on the second, and then Mike will circle around to the first. So, we are not assuming that we will balance sheet every loan that we underwrite in the future. Again, what we're just -- what we're trying to do in the path that we've laid forward is just to make very clear that we're not interested in running and having a business which is focused on a stand-alone mortgage product. We very much appreciate the importance of mortgage to the consumer base. And we're going to continue to stay in the business. But we're going to view it as part of the importance in the broader relationship. So, that means we'll be originating both, conforming and nonconforming mortgages. And we'll continue to make the decision as to what goes on our balance sheet as we have done in the past. The fact that we'll be originating a lot less will certainly mean that over time, the MSR and the overall servicing book will come down very naturally based upon that, over a fairly long period of time. But we'll also look for intelligent and economic ways to reduce the complexity and the size of our servicing book between now and then. And if those present themselves, we'll certainly be interested in doing that. And I know Mike will talk a little bit about this, but I think one of the things we were just trying to say when we think about the size of the impact of exiting the correspondent business immediately is given the fact that mortgage volumes are so low, and revenues are so low. The revenue impact of exiting the correspondent business in the short term is not meaningful. It's a very small number of people. So, that's not all that meaningful in the short term. The real benefit comes over time as we reduce the size of the servicing business, which, as we've tried to make the point is, it's not just reducing expenses, but it's not profitable for us today in a whole bunch of these segments where we continue to have the servicing. And so, it becomes a positive over time. And it's just -- but that is not a short-term benefit for us but certainly a medium- to longer-term one. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And the only thing I'd add is all you lose initially, Betsy, is the gain on sale on the origination. The servicing is still here. And that in any given quarter over the last couple of years is low tens of millions of dollars. So, it's a really small impact. Betsy Graseck : The servicing cost is low tens of millions? Mike Santomassimo : The only thing you lose today by exiting correspondent is the gain on sale on the origination of mortgage. Betsy Graseck : The low tens of millions is the gain on sale? Mike Santomassimo : Correct. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Mike Santomassimo : The servicing of the existing portfolio is still here and\u2026 Charles Scharf : Part of the broader servicing dialogue. Betsy Graseck : Because one of the follow-ups I got was it, does it impact the scale? Obviously, it reduces the flow over existing plants. So, does that matter to how you price your reach? Charles Scharf : Correspondent? Betsy Graseck : Yes, I mean\u2026 Charles Scharf : No, it's not even close. I mean, the amount that we're originating today relative to the scale we have in the business is -- it's immaterial. And we'll -- and even as we downsize the portfolio on the servicing side, the whole point -- our servicing portfolio can be substantially, substantially lower, and we'll still have scale to be able to originate the product and we would say in a more profitable way than we're doing it today. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So, the remaining mortgage origination channels are 100% retail, is that right? Charles Scharf : Yes. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Right. Because you're at a wholesale, you're out of correspondent? Charles Scharf : Yes. That's correct. Operator : The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. A question for you. With the CFPB settlement, there was a comment by the head of CFPB about growth initiatives slowing your progress. So, Charlie, as a question to you is what are you planning to do in regards to that comment in terms of the growth initiatives? Are you trying to slow anything? Any color on that? Charles Scharf : Yes. I addressed it in my remarks, which is we've been very, very clear. And I think if you look back on every earnings call, let alone any time I speak publicly, we're very consistent in making sure that everyone understands both, internally and externally, that our No. 1 priority is getting that work done. That is how we're running the company. We have very clear processes internally to make sure that, that happens. And we're very confident that's the case. And the things that we are doing to grow the business, we think, are actually helpful to actually making it a more controlled place. And we're going to continue to go forward the same way we've been going forward, being very conscious of making sure things don't get in the way. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. A completely different question. On -- in the past, you've given some color on deposits and among different tiers of customers. Any color, any update on where those stand currently and your outlook on that? Charles Scharf : It's still very much the same, which is kind of intuitive that those who went in with lower balances are the ones who are living more paycheck to paycheck. And they are seeing more stress than those that have not had that. But I would say that it's the rate of change, it's still the same across most of the affluent spectrum. So, the trends are still very consistent. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Operator : And our final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good afternoon. Charlie, kind of to -- excuse me -- flip this question from your answers to the servicing and the residential mortgage business, are there any lines of businesses that -- I know you can't go out and make an acquisition, of course, but any lines of businesses you're looking to grow and enhance and beef up maybe through hiring groups of people to do that, you know, strategic increase? Charles Scharf : Listen, I think when we look at all of the -- I mean, I've said this in the past, when we look at each of these businesses that we have, and that's going to be a consumer bank, it's consumer lending, wealth, commercial and the corporate investment bank. With the exception of the Home Lending business and that the rest of the consumer lending businesses that lend, it's all going to be based upon returns and what we're seeing in terms of market competitiveness. All of these businesses have the opportunity to continue to grow share. And when we think about the things that we're doing to invest, we are targeting investment banking ads in both coverage and products. We're focused in Commercial Banking, the build-out of both the corporate investment offerings for that customer base, both the corporate investment bank and the commercial bank of opportunities to continue to improve what we do from the treasury services perspective. And so, we see growth opportunities there. I've talked about the opportunities in our wonderful wealth management business to bring on some more investment teams as we've reoriented that business. And when we wind up looking on the consumer lending side, you've seen growth in the Credit Card side of the business, which we would expect to continue. And our consumer bank is -- we very carefully evolve from fixing the problems that we've had, taking advantage of the franchise. So, when we talk about -- and we have this page in the deck, Page 19 in the investor -- in the earnings presentation, we do see multiple places for us to be able to increase the rate of growth by just organically, which sometimes involves adding people. Sometimes it's building technology. Sometimes it's just improved execution. And there are other things like affluent and whatnot that I haven't mentioned, but they're a bunch, and they're pretty broad. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just as a quick follow-up. Mike, you guys mentioned that there was a private equity or equity write-down in the quarter. Can you share with us how big that was? And then just -- I know over the years, you guys have done very well in this area. But -- and then second, how big is the portfolio? What's the remaining there? Mike Santomassimo : Sure. It was about $1 billion write-down, 750 million after noncontrolling interests. And so, that's on the first page of the release, if you want to refer back. It was primarily driven by some write-downs in enterprise software companies. And in particular, it was really one investment that drove most of it. And I would just point out, we had a -- that investment is still a very good investment. The company is a good investment, and we're still holding it well above where we -- where the invested amount is. Charles Scharf : Just to be clear, we're holding it at something like still\u2026 Mike Santomassimo : A little under $0.5 billion. Charles Scharf : Yes. I would say 10 times what we invested in it. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Charles Scharf : But like all of -- all enterprise software companies, it's the company -- it's just -- it's the rate of growth over the next year or so has come down substantially, but it's still a very high-quality company. Mike Santomassimo : And then just more broadly, on the venture business, we've done -- the team has done a great job over a very long period of time, and we still think it's a very good business. Operator : And that was our final question. Mike Santomassimo : Okay. Thank you, all. And we appreciate the time, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Take care, everyone. Bye, bye. Operator : Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties.  Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review first quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some first quarter highlights. Our results in the quarter were strong and reflected the continued progress we're making to improve returns. We grew revenue from both the fourth quarter and a year ago. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives and expenses declined from both the fourth quarter and the year ago, driven by lower operating losses, but we continue to be focused on controlling other expenses as well. The consumer and majority of our businesses remain strong. Delinquencies and net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase as expected. We're looking for signs of accelerated deterioration in asset classes or segments of our customers. And broadly speaking, we saw a little change in the trends from the prior quarter. However, weakness continues to develop in commercial real estate office, and Mike will discuss this in more detail. Given what we're seeing, we're taking incremental actions to tighten credit on higher risk segments but continue to lend broadly. We increased our allowance for credit losses for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our economic expectations used to support the allowance have not changed meaningfully, but we do continue to look at specific asset classes, such as commercial real estate to appropriately assess the adequacy of the allowance. We will continue to monitor the trends in each of our loan portfolios to determine the future action is warranted. Both commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago, but were relatively stable from the fourth quarter. Consumer spending remained strong with growth in both debit and credit card spend, but spending began to soften late in the quarter. The decline in average deposits that started a year ago continued in the first quarter primarily driven by customers seeking higher-yielding alternatives and continued growth in consumer spending. We did see some moderate inflows from the few specific banks that have been highlighted in the press but those inflows have abated. Our CET1 ratio, which was already strong, increased to 10.8% even as we resumed common stock repurchases in the first quarter buying back $4 billion in common stock. Let me share some thoughts on the recent market events impacting the banking industry. We're glad that the work we have completed over the last several years has put us in a position to help support the U.S. financial system. Along with 10 other large banks, we utilized our strength and liquidity, and we made a $5 billion uninsured deposit into First Republic Bank, reflecting our confidence in the country's banking system and to help provide First Republic with liquidity to continue serving its customers. I'm proud of everything our employees have done during this historic period to be there for our customers. We believe banks of all sizes are an important part of our financial system as each is uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities. It's important to recognize that banks have different operating models and that the banks that fail in the first quarter were quite different from what people think of when they think about the typical regional bank. These particular banks had concentrated business models with heavy reliance on uninsured deposits. Our franchise and those of many other banks operate with a broader business model and more diversified funding sources. It is times like these that the many benefits of our own franchise become even more clear. Our diversified business model provides opportunities to serve our customers broadly, which reduces concentration risk across the different elements of risk. Most importantly, our customers benefit from our size and the range of banking services we provide, which helps us build a full relationship with individuals and companies. We also have strong capital and liquidity positions, which include a mix of deposits and access to multiple funding sources and our continued focus on financial and credit risk management allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles. Now let me update you on the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Our top priority remains building out our risk and control framework appropriate for our company. I spent time in my recent annual letter highlighting why we remain confident in our ability to complete this work, including having much more effective reporting and processes in place to provide appropriate oversight, adding close to 10,000 people across numerous risk and control-related groups as part of our commitment to make the investments needed to complete door and building the management discipline and culture to govern and execute the work, which includes the operating committee reviewing risk and regulatory progress and escalations on a weekly basis. I also summarize the actions we've taken to simplify the way we operate. This work continued in the first quarter as we largely completed the exit of the correspondent home lending business as part of our plans to simplify that business. We're also narrowing our retail mortgage business to focus on predominantly bank customers and underserved communities. Our strategy includes broadening our existing investment from the special purpose credit program to include purchase loans, investing an additional $100 million to advance racial equity in homeownership and deploying additional home mortgage consultants in local minority communities. We continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions. We announced a multiyear agreement with Choice Hotels to launch a new co-branded credit card this month creating a best-in-class credit card program designed to enhance our customers' experience and bring them more value. We rolled out early pay day late last year, which makes eligible direct deposits available up to two days early. In the first quarter, this enhancement provided customers early access to over $200 billion in direct deposits. We launched Flex Loan in the fourth quarter, a digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers, convenient and affordable access to funds. Customer response continues to exceed our expectations, we've originated over 100,000 loans since November. Digital adoption and usage among our consumer customers continued to increase. We added over 500,000 mobile active customers in the first quarter and digital logins increased 6% from a year ago. Since rolling out Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients late last year, we've received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the new user experience. Vantage uses AI and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients' specific needs. We also continued to make progress on our environmental, social, and governance work. We announced a $50 million grant to the NAACP to support efforts to advance racial equity in America. This is the single largest donation at the NAACP has ever received from the corporation and builds on our long-standing relationship with the NAACP that spans more than 20 years. The Wells Fargo Foundation expanded its commitment to housing affordability through another $20 million housing affordability breakthrough challenge to advance ideas to help meet the need for more affordable homes across the country.  We also announced a $20 million commitment to advance economic opportunities in Native American communities including addressing housing, small business, financial health and sustainability. Before concluding, I wanted to highlight the management changes we announced yesterday. Mary Mack, the CEO of Consumer and Small Business banking is retiring this summer. She spent her entire career at Wells Fargo and has led consumer and small business banking for the past seven years through a significant amount of change, including defining a new path forward to the business. I can think a few Wells Fargo colleagues who have done as much for our company and have been as visible in the communities that we serve over such a long period of time. We also announced that Saul Van Beurden, Head of Technology at Wells Fargo will succeed Mary. Sal is a strong leader a technologist and he knows how to run a business. This makes him the ideal person to lead consumer and small business banking into the future. Our branch network will continue to be the key business -- to the business. But our customers expect us to provide them with increasingly digitized and seamless banking experiences across all channels. Saul understands this deeply and has consistently proven his ability to convert new products and services across Wells Fargo. Finally, Tracy Karen, currently Head of Consumer Technology will become head of technology for the company reporting to me. Tracy has worked with the technology and finance industry for more than 20 years and has led a series of business critical initiatives to modernize our technology platforms across our consumer businesses. She is a strong results-driven leader. It's always great when we can tap our own leaders for roles within the company, and I want to thank Mary for everything she's done during her tenure at Wells Fargo. It's truly been a pleasure working with her. As we look forward, we're carefully watching customer behavior for clues on how the economic environment is changing. Customer activity is still relatively strong and delinquencies remain low, though they are increasing. There are pockets of risks such as commercial office real estate, which will likely impact institutions differently, and we're proactively managing our own exposures. We continue to expect economic growth to slow, and we are preparing for a range of scenarios. We will continue to monitor both the markets and our customers and will react accordingly. Our diversified business model should enable us to support our customers throughout economic cycles. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the first quarter was $5 billion or $1.23 per diluted common share. While there was a lot going on in the banking industry around us, we continue to focus on our priorities and our results reflected the progress we are making, which I'll highlight throughout the call. Starting with capital and liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.8%, up approximately 20 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting our earnings in the quarter and lower risk-weighted assets. After pausing share repurchases for the prior three quarters, we repurchased $4 million of common stock in the first quarter. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, and we expect to continue to prudently return excess capital to shareholders in the coming quarters. In the first quarter, our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 22 percentage points above the regulatory minimum. We continue to benefit from a diversified deposit base with over 60% of our deposits in our Consumer Banking and Lending segment as of the first quarter, which is a higher percentage than before the pandemic. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. Net loan charge-offs continue to slowly increase to 26 basis points in the first quarter but were still below pre-pandemic levels. Commercial net loan charge-offs decreased $16 million from the fourth quarter to 5 basis points. However, while losses improved, we continue to see some gradual weakening in underlying credit performance, including higher nonperforming assets. We are proactively monitoring our clients' sensitivity to inflation and higher rates and are taking appropriate actions when warranted. We are also closely monitoring our commercial real estate office portfolio, and I'll share some more details on our exposure on the next slide. As expected, we've seen consumer delinquencies and losses gradually increase. Total consumer net loan charge-offs increased $60 million from the fourth quarter to 56 basis points of average loans, driven by an increase in the credit card portfolio. While most consumers remain resilient, we've seen some consumer financial health trends gradually weakening from a year ago, and we've continued to take credit taking actions to position the portfolio for a slowing economy. Nonperforming assets increased 7% from the fourth quarter, driven by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans over down 12% from a year ago due to lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans. Of note, 87% of the nonaccrual loans in our commercial real estate portfolio were current on interest and 75% recurring on both principal and interest as of the end of the first quarter. Our allowance for credit losses increased $643 million in the first quarter, reflecting an increase for commercial real estate loans, primarily office loans as well as an increase for credit card model loans. Given the increased focus on commercial real estate loans, especially office, we provided more details on our portfolio on Slide 6. We have $154.7 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter with 35.7% of office loans, which represented 4% of our total loans outstanding.  The office market continues to show signs of weakness due to lower demand, higher financing costs and challenging capital market conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to meaningful loss content yet, we expect to see more stress over time. As you would expect, we have been derisking the office portfolio, which resulted in commitments declining 5% from a year ago, and we continue to proactively work with borrowers to manage our exposure, including structural enhancements and paydowns as warranted. As you can see in the slide, we've provided some additional data on the office portfolio, including approximately 12% is owner occupied. Therefore, the loan performance is mostly tied to the cash flow of the owner's operating business rather than rents paid by tenants. Nearly one third had recourse to a guarantor typically through a repayment guarantee. The portfolio is geographically diverse, and as you'd expect, the largest concentrations are in California and New York. Over two third of our office loans are in the corporate investment banking business, and the vast majority of this portfolio is institutional quality real estate with high-caliber sponsors. While approximately 80% of its cost, keep in mind that this is a single measure that is hard to evaluate in isolation. For example, newer or refurbished properties may perform better regardless of whether they are at A or B. We are providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but as is usually the case in commercial real estate, each property situation is different and a myriad of other variables, such as leasing rates, loan-to-value and debt yields can determine performance, which is why we regularly review the portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis. As a result of market conditions and the recent increases in criticized assets and nonaccrual loans, we've increased our allowance for credit losses for office loans for the past four quarters. The allowance for credit losses coverage ratio at the end of the first quarter for the office portfolio in the corporate investment bank was 5.7%. We will continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help it solve issues they may be facing. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 6% from a year ago and were relatively stable from the fourth quarter, while period-end loans declined 1% from the fourth quarter with lower balances across our consumer and commercial portfolios. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 244 basis points from a year ago and 56 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 7% from a year ago and 2% for the fourth quarter due to the consumer deposit outflows as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives and continued spending. During the market stress last month, we experienced a brief increase in deposit inflows that has since abated and while our period-end deposit balances were slightly higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, they're still down 2% from the fourth quarter.  As expected, our average deposit cost increased 37 basis points from the fourth quarter to 83 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Our mix of noninterest-bearing deposits declined from 35% in the fourth quarter to 32% in the first quarter but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. First quarter net interest income was $13.3 billion, which was 45% higher than a year ago as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $97 million decline for the fourth quarter was due to two fewer business days. Our full year net interest income guidance has not changed from last quarter as we still expect 2023 net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared with 2022. And Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned this year will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and repricing and loan demand. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 1% from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses and the impact of visions. The increase in personnel expense from the fourth quarter was driven by approximately $650 million seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement eligible employees and 401(k) matching contributions. Our full year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses, is still expected to be approximately $5.2 billion, unchanged from the guidance we provided last quarter. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and lending on Slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 28% from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. We are continuing to make investments in this business. We're beginning to increase marketing spend. We're accelerating the efforts to renovate and refurbish our branches, for our bankers, we're investing in new tools and capabilities to provide better and more personalized advice to customers. We're continuing to enhance our mobile app and mobile active users were up 4% year-over-year and we're also seeing increased activity and positive initial indicators after our rollout of Wells Fargo premium last year. It's early on for all of these initiatives, but we're starting to see some green shoots. At the same time, we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Teller transactions continue to decline with reduced head count. We reduced headcount by 9% and total branches were down 4% from a year ago. In home lending, mortgage rates remained elevated and the mortgage market continued to decline. Our home lending revenue declined 42% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and including a significant decline from the correspondent channel and lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. We continue to reduce headcount in the first quarter, and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline due to the strategic changes we announced earlier this year. We stopped accepting applications from the correspondent channel as announced in January and begin to reduce the complexity and the size of the servicing book. During the first quarter, we successfully marketed mortgage servicing rights for approximately $50 billion of loans serviced for others that we expect to close later this year. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to simplify and reduce the size of our servicing business. Credit card revenue increased 3% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point-of-sale volume. Auto revenue declined 12% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression from credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates. Personal lending revenue was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 83% from a year ago and 55% from the fourth quarter with declines in both correspondent and retail originations. As I mentioned, we stopped accepting correspondent applications in January. So, going forward, our originations will be focused on serving Wells Fargo customers and underserved communities. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for four consecutive quarters and the balances were down 80% at the end of the first quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 32% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions and continued price competition. Debit card spending increased 2% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, an increase from the 1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter. Discretionary spending drove the growth with nondiscretionary spending stable from the fourth quarter levels. Credit card spending increased 16% from a year ago, in line with the year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter with sustained growth in both discretionary and nondiscretionary spending. Spending growth slowed throughout the quarter but was still at double-digit levels in March. We continue to see some slight moderation in payment rates in the first quarter, but they were still well above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue grew by 73% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances while deposit-related fees were lower, reflecting higher earnings credit rate on noninterest-bearing deposits. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 7% year-over-year, driven by loan growth which was partially offset by lower net gains from equity securities. Average loan balances were up 15% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization. After being stable in second half of last year, volume utilization increased slightly in the first quarter. Average loan balances have grown for seven consecutive quarters and were up 2% from the fourth quarter with the growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory. Growth in middle market banking was once again driven by larger clients, including both new and existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller clients.  Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. Investment management investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with clients across all major products in nearly all industries. While commercial real estate market transactions are down across the industry, our commercial real estate revenue grew 32% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Markets revenue increased 53% from a year ago driven by higher trading results across all asset classes. Average loans grew 4% from a year ago, but were down from the fourth quarter. Lower balances in banking reflected a combination of slow demand increased payoffs and relatively stable line utilization. The decline in commercial real estate balances were driven by the higher rate environment and lower commercial real estate sales volumes. On Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago, driven by lower asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income was driven by the impact of higher rates, which was partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives. At the end of the first quarter, cash alternatives were approximately 12% of total client assets, up from approximately 4% a year ago. Expenses decreased 4% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives. Average loans were down 1% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending. Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined $103 million or 83% from a year ago as higher net interest income was more than offset by lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. Results in the first quarter included $342 million of net losses on equity securities or $223 million pretax and net of noncontrolling interests. In summary, our results in the first quarter reflected an improvement in our earnings capacity. We grew revenue and reduced expenses and had strong growth in pretax free provision profits. As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slightly increase from historical lows, and we are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where appropriate. Our capital levels grew even as we resume stock common stock repurchases, and we expect repurchases to continue. In the guidance we provided last quarter for full year 2023, net interest income and expenses, excluding operating losses, has not changed. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Thank you for taking the question. Mike, I was hoping to just start out on the deposit side. So, when you talk about the influx of deposits from some of the sort of special situations having abated, does that money actually leave the bank? Or is it just sort of the inflows that have stopped? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, the \u2013 hey, Scott, thanks for the question. Look, the inflows stopped, right? And they came in, in a pretty short period of time and those inflows stop. And I think what you're seeing since then is just normal spending in the consumer side and normal activity across the other businesses. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And then I guess maybe to switch gears just a bit. I think in your prepared remarks, you had discussed plans to sort of prudently return excess capital in coming quarters. I was very glad to see the resumption in repurchase in the first quarter. But just given all the kind of cross currents that we've got, whether it's uncertainty on the regulatory environment or uncertainty on the economy kind of countered against your very strong capital levels. Just curious for maybe a little more color on how you would be thinking about share repurchase in -- through the remainder of the year. Charlie Scharf : Yes. This is Charlie. Let me take a stab. I would say, listen, I think the way we feel about it is our capital levels grew quarter-over-quarter even after we purchased the $4 billion of stock. So, it just shows our ability to generate capital, if necessary, because of the environment or regulatory changes or things like that. So, because of that, we do feel like we have the ability to continue to return capital to shareholders while we still have plenty of flexibility to deal with anything which could come our way. And so, our excess above the regulatory minimums plus buffers is extremely high beyond what we feel that it needs to be. So we think we can continue to address that and still be very prudent with how we manage capital. Scott Siefers : Wonderful. Okay. I have a bunch of more questions, but I have a feeling they'll be asked going forward as well. So, Charlie, Mike, thank you guys very much. Really appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. So, I wanted to get a little bit more granular on some of the expense trends that we're seeing. We've gone through the exercise of benchmarking your segment efficiency ratios versus peers. Clearly, you've made significant strides improving profitability across virtually every segment, commercial CIB and wealth, the PPNR margins are running really in line with the peer group. It's still the consumer efficiency ratio in the mid-60s, which is running well above peers. And I was hoping you could just speak to the opportunity on the expense side within consumer. How much of a benefit should you see from the retrenchment in mortgage? And maybe what do you see as a normalized efficiency target for the segment just given your current mix of business? Mike Santomassimo : Steve, it's Mike. I'll start and Charlie can chime in if he wants. The -- I think when you think about consumer, I think, we still have a lot more work to do there. And it's both in the consumer lending space or the mortgage space as we simplify the servicing side of that business, and that just takes a little bit of time to work its way through needs to be thoughtful and in some cases, requires a little bit of investment in technology and the like.  And then on the consumer banking side, we've continued to rationalize the branch footprint and branch set up. We've - we continue to see teller transactions and other things decline. And so, I think you'll see us focus there. And hopefully, what you've seen in that segment is a consistent quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount and other factors, and that will sort of continue to hopefully be the case. And then when you think about just where the end state is, we shouldn't look any different than our peers, our best-in-class peers for each of our segments, including that one. So, over a period of time, that's the goal. Charlie Scharf : And I would just add, when you look at our -- that segment, we obviously mix versus other people is an issue. Our home lending business is today extremely inefficient, which is part of the reason why we made the decision that we made. So, we've got a lot of wood to chop there, which will play out over a period of time to make that business more efficient. And as we've talked about on the consumer banking side, we've done, I think, for many, many years after Mary got her job in the consumer banking operation, our focus was dealing with the cleanup, which they've done an exceptional job in the consumer and small business bank about and then turned our attention to becoming more efficient, which she has worked really hard on.  And that's a combination of looking at our branch footprint, staffing within the branches, migrating people to digital, and we're behind on that. But there has been a lot of progress made over the last 1.5 years to 2 years. And so there's still a tremendous amount of opportunity there, but it's in flight. Steven Chubak : Really helpful color. Just for my follow-up, I wanted to unpack some of the NII trends that we're seeing within the wealth side specifically. And there's a big focus right now on yield-seeking behavior if the higher for longer rate environment persists. You and your peers have seen contraction in NII sequentially and continued deposit outflows. I was hoping you could speak to whether you're seeing any abatement in just the pace of cash sorting or yield-seeking behavior as of yet or if it's continued at a pretty healthy clip. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, I'll take that. And when you look at the sequential change in NII, it's really the two fewer days in the quarter that drove it. Otherwise, it's pretty flat to the fourth quarter as we thought it would be when we talked in January. When you think about wealth, it's been pretty stable, the trend. It's not accelerating. It's not decelerating at any significant clip at this point. And what we see there is we're capturing that cash that -- those cash alternatives that people are buying in the wealth business. And so, I think that trend will continue for a while. And the good news is we're capturing that in other ways, but the trend has been pretty stable, and that's probably going to be the case for a little longer. Operator : The next question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Mike, I was wondering what your outlook is for the second quarter NII. If you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes to that and what you're thinking for second quarter? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. John, you look at -- as things are trending, you can see where deposits are on a period end on an average basis. So that's probably input number one. And then you can see that deposit yields have increased, right? So, those two things are going to be the biggest driver. So, you should expect a little bit of a step down from Q1 into Q2. And we'll see exactly sort of what that looks like as we get a little bit into the quarter. But I think the variables are there to kind of come up with a range of outcomes. John McDonald : Yes. Okay. And the outlook for the full year obviously embeds a pretty big step down from the first quarter starting point. Can you give us any more color about the types of assumptions you have embedded into the full year outlook on deposit flows, mix shift and reprice data? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, sure. And as we've talked over the last few quarters, there's still a ton of uncertainty out there with regards to really all the inputs that go into that, right? And whether it's the mix of deposits, the absolute level or where pricing will be. And so, our guide assumes that it's still going to be a pretty competitive space for deposits on the pricing side that we will still see some mix shift happening and that we'll see some moderate declines as people continue to spend and the trends happen. So, as we talked about even last quarter, I think we'll get -- as time goes by, we get more and more information. And so, we're hopeful that there's upside, but -- to the forecast, but we'll see that in the second half of the year, and it will be a function of how all those factors play out, but we're hopeful that we'll see that and there'll be some upside there. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin : I just want to ask a follow-up on the cost side. So, I think we're all pretty clear on your view of continuing to hold the core flat from here. But I think an ongoing question is just as we look further out, and I know there's no crystal ball here. Like, what would you give the line of sight when that next wave of gross saves related to all the duplicative and extra buildup in the infrastructure related to risk compliance, et cetera? When you get the line of sight on when you can start to sunset that? Because I know you talked about that as a big point of how you get the ROE up over the medium term. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Ken, let me try to clarify a little bit of that. So, I think when you look at what we've we talked about last quarter in terms of getting to a 15% ROTCE in the medium term, that didn't assume that we would have to take out a significant amount of the cost related to the risk and regulatory build-outs that we're doing. And that efficiency on those expenses will be out a little while. It could be years in terms of -- before we really get at some of that. So -- but I think our focus is to get the return to a sustainable 15% in the medium term by not having to rely on that. It really goes back to what we talked about really making sure capital gets optimized, not just in terms of shareholder return, but also across the balance sheet requires us to continue to execute on the efficiency initiatives outside of the risk and regulatory work, and then we'll start to get the benefit of some of the investments that we've been making now for the last couple of years. Charlie Scharf : And I'll just add to that, just to be clear, when we think about the opportunities to continue to drive efficiency in the Company, we're not -- we don't even think about all the expenses related to the risk and regulatory framework work that we're doing. That work is -- and those expenses are -- they're necessary, and those are not excuse for us not to be efficient in everything else that we do. And so, as we talked about in the consumer businesses a second ago, we look across all the things that we do, and there's still significant opportunity to just become more efficient and either reduce the expense base or provide more capacity to invest going forward. And at some point, can we become more efficient in how we run the risk infrastructure of the Company, probably. But that's not on the radar screen and not necessary for us to achieve our efficiency goals. Ken Usdin : Yes. And thanks for those clarifications. One, just a question on the fee side. I know watching your trading results are a lot different than watching some of the bigger peers. But just looking at that $1.3 billion on the face of the income statement this quarter, in the context of the environment, can you help us put that into context? Was that just an exceptional result this quarter? Did it have anything we should be mindful of as we think forward and just your general outlook there? Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, sure. We certainly benefited from the volatility that we saw, particularly in the rate market and other -- some of the other asset classes in the quarter. And you can see that in the results. But when you look at some of the core platforms in FX and other areas, we've been just consistently investing in some of those platforms. So hopefully, over time, you'll see good results there. But the quarter definitely was influenced by the volatility that we saw across the market. Operator : The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I just wanted to follow up on the capital comments. I guess, Charlie, you talked about this. Is it fair for us to assume, clearly, we have the SCB coming out of the stress test, that will be 1 data point and then the Basel reforms. Should we assume that the CET1 likely drift higher, maybe 11%, maybe higher in the near term, while you still buy back stock? Is that the right assumption? And secondly, I think, Mike, you mentioned about optimizing for capital and RWA. Just maybe if you can call out a few things that you can do to optimize RWA relative to where the balance sheet is today? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, sure. Thanks. I think the simple answer to your first question is no. We don't expect that to continue to keep drifting up. Certainly, we'll find out the results of CCAR with everybody else in June. And then, we've got Basel IV, which is a little bit longer time line than that. And -- but we're 160 basis points above the regulatory minimum buffers. We've got plenty of capital to deal with whatever comes out of that. And as we said, over time, we'll get closer to 100 basis points or so above those -- above the 9.2%. And so, I think there's plenty of capacity to deal with whatever comes and continue to return share -- money back to shareholders, as Charlie said. The\u2026 Charlie Scharf : I think the second part just to -- and again, all I was trying to say is we have a lot of flexibility to deal with things that come our way. And so, we're not anticipating significant additional capital needs. We're not anticipating that any potential downturn could create additional capital need inside of the business. All we're saying is that if anything of those things were to happen, we have the flexibility to deal with that, both because of the amount of earnings that we have as well as the existing excess capital that we have. So you'll add those -- you take that, you say -- we bought -- all those things happened while we bought $4 billion of stock back this quarter. So, we feel we'll be able to continue to return capital and still maintain a very conservative position. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And then just to give you a couple like examples to help illustrate the capital optimization. The mortgage business is one of them. If we want mortgage exposure, we can buy securities. You don't have to always hold the mortgage. If you're buying securities, you don't have to buy UMBS, you could buy Ginnies. And so there's plenty -- and then you can look at each of the underlying portfolios and make sure we're getting the return from a relationship point of view that we think, whether that's in the commercial bank or the corporate investment bank. And so, I think there's plenty of areas that we can either reallocate capital to clients that we think will get better returns for or optimize some of the underlying portfolios. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just one separate question. You made tremendous progress, Charlie, since taking over on the compliance risk management front. There was a news article last night talking about some OCC MRAs. I don't expect you to comment on that. But, just give us a sense from a shareholder perspective, your level of confidence around the risk of another shoe dropping on -- major setback to all the efforts and actions that you've taken to address the regulatory orders, to the extent you can, just to give comfort that the progress that's been made is getting us closer to the finish line as opposed to another big setback that could push us back again. Charlie Scharf : Yes. Listen, I would refer you back to my shareholder letter where I wrote about it extensively. And I think we still continue to feel exactly the way we felt when we wrote that letter. It wasn't that long ago, which is we have continued work to do. We feel very confident in our ability to get the work done and that we're making progress. And so, we live in an environment where things can come up. That's always the case. So, we don't want to pretend like there are no risks of other things out there. But if there was anything specific, we would do our best to let you know. And we feel good about the progress that we're making and are extremely focused on making sure that we've got all the attention decked against it. But we're confident that the things that we're doing will close the gaps that existed at the Company when we got here. Operator : The next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the -- back to the NII drivers, can you maybe give us an updated expectation on how you're thinking about loan growth here as you look through 2023. I know you cited some of the pressures on the consumer side, but some of the favorable trends still in commercial. And then separately, on the deposit side, do you have an updated expectation regarding your total deposit beta as you see pricing pressure continue? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, thanks. So, on the loan side, I think we're definitely seeing pockets of growth in places like the commercial bank, and that's been pretty consistent now for a couple of quarters. It's not -- but the overall growth rate across total loans has moderated for the last three quarters, and -- which is exactly what we thought might happen when we were talking last summer. And so, I think it will still be pretty moderate. I wouldn't expect huge growth in loans over the rest of the year. And embedded in our guidance is some low-single-digit growth rate in terms of loans for the year. And so, I think that's what we're assuming there. What was the second part again, John? Sorry. John Pancari : Yes, it was around the update\u2026 Mike Santomassimo : Deposit beta, sorry. John Pancari : Yes. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No. Look, on the deposit side, to date, betas have played out almost exactly what we thought -- how we thought they would. And I think from here, the path of rates will matter. Competition will matter. And so, as I mentioned earlier in the call, we're still assuming it's going to be pretty competitive when we give you the guidance that we gave you. And I think we may find that hopefully that it gets -- that maybe we're being a little conservative there, but we do think at this point, it will still be competitive. And I think the betas will be pretty reasonable, though on the consumer side, when you look back after the rates rise stop. John Pancari : Got it. Okay. Thanks, Mike. And then separately on the commercial real estate front, maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit on the stress that you're seeing. I know you discussed office. Maybe can you talk about your LTVs in office maybe on a refreshed basis, if you happen to have that and maybe in other portfolios as well because clearly the change between origination LTVs versus where we're seeing refreshed levels come in are clearly what is motivating some of the impact around reserve behavior. So, if you can give us a little color there, that would be helpful. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, sure. Look, in the office space right now, as many others have said, too, like this is going to play out over an extended period of time. We're not seeing a lot of near-term stress in terms of what -- whether clients are current or seeing very big issues on a property-by-property basis at this point, but we do expect some of that to come. And I think it will be for all of the reasons that everyone is reporting on, right? And in particular, it will be in cities that you see weakness in places like San Francisco and L.A., a little bit in Seattle. And so, it's all the places where either lease rates are already lower than the national average or the secular changes around back to office are changing a little bit more a bigger way. And -- but it's going to take time. And we just haven't seen it translate into lost content here, and we're going very granular property by property. And so, giving you LTV numbers from a portfolio -- at a portfolio basis really isn't that helpful at this point because it really is going to be a matter of like what each of these underlying properties look like and what the issues are there. And we haven't seen a lot of trades happening either recently. And so, that also will impact how you think about the valuations. And what we're doing is really just making sure we stress it in a whole bunch of different ways on a property level basis to make sure we understand where the potential issues might come from. Operator : The next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions, a little bit of a follow-up. But one on the credit side, I wanted to just understand a little bit about the recoveries in commercial. I know in the deck you mentioned that commercial NCLs were down, in part due to higher recoveries. And I just wanted to understand how long you see those recoveries persisting. And is there any driver for them actually increasing from here? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. There really isn't any story there, Betsy. I mean we get recoveries every quarter, and there really isn't a significant trend change one way or the other. And again, it's going to come back down to individual underlying issues or situations that drive it quarter-to-quarter. But I wouldn't read too much into the trend. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then separately on wealth deposits. I know earlier in the call, you addressed this that you would expect to see the wealth outflows continue at current pace or so for at least a little bit of time. I'm wondering, is there any anchor that you can give us with regard to wealth deposits as a percentage of client assets that existed pre-COVID that maybe we should anchor back on in modeling that line item? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I mean, what we gave you in my commentary was just cash as a percentage of assets. And it's quite a bit higher than it was before, about 12% now versus 4%. And obviously, deposits is going to be a subcomponent of that. And there are other drivers, right, of how much cash people are going to hold as a percentage of assets. And right now, you're seeing a lot of what is going into cash alts, it's coming out of other asset classes. So it's not -- so it's a little harder to give you a specific number of like deposits as a percentage of assets because you're seeing people sell equities and other asset classes and drive up those cash balances. Betsy Graseck : Right. And cash for you is it's including things like MMF and treasury bills, things like that? Mike Santomassimo : Absolutely, yes. And so, I would just take the current balance that you see in the wealth space and the deposit side and assume it continues to come down at a pretty -- at a stable pace for a little bit. Betsy Graseck : And then just last question here on deposit betas. I know you indicated that it should be okay. I guess, I'm wondering how you think about deposit betas this cycle versus last cycle. Similar? Higher? Lower? Any sense as to -- versus prior cycle in magnitude would be great. Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Look, I mean it will be different, obviously. And part of what's going to drive that is how long rates stay higher. And I think that will -- we'll find that out over a period of time. But as you can tell, where betas have performed so far, they've performed pretty well when you look at it relative to the last cycle, particularly given how far rates have moved up in excess of what happened last time. And so -- and they're behaving exactly as you might think, right? And if you go portfolio by portfolio, the betas are pretty high on the large corporate side. That's been the case now for a couple of quarters. They're a little bit lower in the commercial bank given the nature of that client base. And in the consumer side, they're relatively low given the amount of rate rises that we've seen so far. And so, I think on the large corporate side, you'll see those be pretty consistent from here and the consumer side will be a function of all the things we talked about earlier. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: I was hoping you guys could elaborate on the slowing consumer spending towards the end of the month? Any more color there and any thoughts on what's driving that? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. It was pretty small when you look at that change. So I wouldn't read too much into it. I think people are still -- there's still a lot of activity out there and consumers are still out spending both on the debit side and the credit side. So, I wouldn't read into a couple of weeks. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then separately, I know I always kind of harp on some of these reg issues. And I appreciate the New York Post article yesterday, you can't comment specifically on. But it did allude to some concerns in your trading business? And obviously, it performed extremely well. You've been growing it, although I don't think you're growing it super aggressively. But there's been some political comments, maybe it was, I don't know, six months ago or so, that you shouldn't be growing your capital markets business, while you're investing in these other areas. So I guess maybe you could just address the trading businesses overall in terms of how you're growing them in a responsible way and how you're making sure the oversight of risk management is fine. I mean because, again, externally, it seems like everything is going really well, but there is -- it's hard to tell. Thank you. Charlie Scharf : We have no concerns over what we're doing in the business. We're not increasing risk in any meaningful way. We've had strong oversight in that business, and we think it continues. And we benefited from business activity, which is focused on customer flow. We have strong financial risk management in the Company and have had that for a long period of time. We have strong risk management over our trading businesses and controls. And I would just be really careful to take the source that you're taking and using that to expand into anything beyond from whence it came. If it was anything meaningful to report, we report it. And as I said, we feel really good about the progress that we're making, and we feel good about the performance of the company. And I think it's that -- that stands on its own. Operator : The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Mike, you talked about some of the reasons why your commercial loan growth was quite strong on a year-over-year basis. Can you share with us, are you guys seeing any reintermediation where the DCM market was very weak in the quarter for the industry? It was weak last year. Are you guys seeing benefits from that where people are -- corporate and commercial customers are coming to you using your balance sheet more so than possibly 1.5-year ago? Mike Santomassimo : Not in any meaningful way. There's always an anecdotal story, I'm sure, out there, but I wouldn't say it's meaningful. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, as a follow-up, I know you gave us some details about the net interest income growth this year. They're still being [Technical Difficulty] annualize the first quarter results... Mike Santomassimo : Hey Gerard, we lost you there for a second. Can you just repeat the whole second part? Gerard Cassidy : Sure. You gave us some details on the outlook for net interest income growth, up 10%. And if you annualize your first quarter number, of course, that's -- that would be greater than the 10% growth for the full year. And you gave us the reasons why there's a lot of uncertainty. The one specific question though is, has your thinking on the yield curve -- and I know this is very hard. Nobody can predict where it's going to be. But are you thinking that the yield curve and maybe a rate cut could be coming sooner and the yield curve comes down when you look at your outlook, or has your outlook for the interest rates changed, I guess, is the question. Mike Santomassimo : Well, I think certainly, the market expectations are implying that there will be a decrease in the late part of the year. And so, I think that's certainly being priced in at the moment. But I do think that you need to be prepared that that's not going to happen. And I think it's possible it doesn't. So, I think as we get a little closer, you'll -- we'll all know. And what we try to do in our guidance is use what the market is telling us, right? So, if that doesn't happen, there's -- and rates are higher than what the market is implying, then there will be a little upside there. Charlie Scharf : Yes. And the only thing I'd add is, listen, in all of this, there's -- I tried to say this in our remarks, which is we've said constantly, we don't know what the future holds. We see what the market is saying. Who knows where the market is right or wrong. You have the Fed share who's talking about expect rates higher for longer. And so, we're prepared for a range of scenarios. When we think about giving guidance, we just try and choose a benchmark, which is the market, which is it's a scenario and pick your own scenario based upon what you all think and you can make your own determination what it will be, but we're just trying to give you both like a benchmark and what supports that benchmark, but also be clear that there are a range of alternatives out there, which could make the result differ, just trying to be as apparent as we can. Gerard Cassidy : No, I appreciate the further insights. That's very helpful. Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Sure. Operator : The next question comes from David Long of Raymond James. David Long : I appreciate all the color on some of the deposit flows. But let me just ask it in a little different way. From a noninterest-bearing deposits figure, the number, the percentage has come down, how do you expect that concentration to change over the course of the next several quarters? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I wouldn't try to predict it exactly over the next couple of quarters. But I think if you look at -- we're about 32% in the quarter. And if you go back a number of years, pre-pandemic, that was in the mid-20s. And so -- so it could -- and we've said this in other forums that you could see it start to trend towards there. Will it get down there? Unknown, but I think you'll see it trend down a little bit more. David Long : Sure. If you look back over, call it, the last 15 years since the great financial crisis, rates have been pretty close to zero outside of a brief periods, just before the pandemic. Do you see noninterest-bearing deposits going back to pre great financial crisis levels for Wells Fargo or the industry, but we had numbers there in the mid to high teens? Mike Santomassimo : I think that's almost impossible to predict. Operator : The last question for today will come from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Chris Kotowski : I guess, I wonder, how do you anticipate managing the duration of your investment securities portfolio from here? I mean, obviously, it must have extended out quite a bit last year. And we saw the mark-to-mark on it increase across the industry. But I noted kind of the HTM portfolio is down about 7% during the quarter. And I mean, do you anticipate running that down? And if so, how quickly does it run down if you do nothing? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I think, obviously, that's going to be a little bit dependent on rates and where rates go, given there's some mortgages - mortgage securities in the portfolio in terms of the burn down. And I think we're going to continue to be thoughtful as we have in the past around thinking about the size of the portfolio in total, including the AFS. And that's really a function of a bunch of things, including how much loan growth we expect to see over a period of time. And then, we look at all of the other constraints that we've got to worry about around liquidity and everything else, and we decide on how much goes into HTM and what the makeup of it is. But at this point, we feel comfortable with the quantum and both in terms of the size of the portfolio and the duration of portfolio. Chris Kotowski : Okay. So, you anticipate keeping it roughly the size, all things being equal, or does it run down? Mike Santomassimo : I think we'll make that decision over time. I don't anticipate the portfolio getting much bigger from here over the next few quarters, but I think we'll make that decision over time. And then, the burn now will be what it is based on where rates and natural maturities of the portfolio go. Charlie Scharf : Alrighty. Everyone, thanks so much. We appreciate it. And we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Operator : Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Good morning. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf, and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thank you, John. And good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some second quarter highlights. We had solid results in the quarter with revenue, pre-tax pre-provision profit, diluted earnings per share, and ROTCE, all higher than a year ago. The revenue growth reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher non-interest income. While our efficiency ratio improved and we continued to make progress on our efficiency initiatives, we had modest expense growth from a year ago. Net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels, but overall credit quality was strong and consumer and business balance sheets remain healthy. We increased our allowance for credit losses by $949 million, primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. While we haven't seen significant losses in our office portfolio today, our detailed loan by loan review of the portfolio has given us a sense how the next several quarters could play out. We've also considered a number of stressed scenarios, all of which informed our actions this quarter. Mike will discuss this in more detail, but I want to make the point that it is very hard to look at any one statistic and determine the risk in the portfolio. Loss content will be driven by a combination of factors, including but not limited to, property type, location, lease rates, lease renewal notice dates, loan structure and borrower behavior. Most importantly, our CRE teams remain focused on working with our clients\u2019 portfolio surveillance and de-risking to minimize loss content. Both commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago, but were down from the first quarter as the economy has slowed and we've taken some credit tightening actions. Credit card spending remained strong, but the rate of growth has slowed from the outsized growth rates we saw throughout 2022. Debit card spending was flat from a year ago with growth in discretionary spend offset by declines in non-discretionary spend. Average deposits were down from the first quarter, driven by lower consumer deposits, while the decline in commercial deposits slowed. Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work. Regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow and as such our continued intensive effort to complete the build-out of an appropriate risk and control framework for a company of our size and complexity is critical. I've continued to emphasize that this is our top priority and will remain so and that while we have implemented substantial portions of the work required, we have more implementation to do as well as work to make sure the changes operate effectively over time. As I've said before, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions until the work is complete. While we're devoting all necessary resources to our risk and control work, we're also continuing to invest in our business to better serve our customers and help drive growth. Our consumer customers have continued to increase their use of our mobile app. We added over 1 million mobile active customers over the past year and mobile logins increased 9% from a year ago. Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant, is now live on our mobile app for all consumer customers. Since launching at the end of April, our customers have interacted with Fargo over 4 million times. We've continued to make important hires, bringing new expertise to Wells Fargo in businesses we are looking to grow. We named Barry Simmons as the new Head of National Sales in Wealth & Investment Management. He\u2019ll be critical in our efforts to better serve clients and help advisors grow their business. We also continued to attract veteran bankers in Corporate and Investment Banking, hiring new managing directors in our banking division in priority growth areas, including a Co-Head of Global Mergers and Acquisitions, Co-Head of Financial Institutions and new heads of financial sponsors, equity capital markets, healthcare and technology, media and telecom. We also continue to focus on better serving our communities. We announced a 10-year strategic partnership with T.D. Jakes Group that could result in up to $1 billion in capital and financing for Wells Fargo to drive economic vitality and inclusivity in communities across America. The Wells Fargo Foundation awarded $7.5 million to Habitat for Humanity to build and repair more than 360 homes nationwide. We've worked with Habitat for Humanity for nearly three decades and donated more than $129 million since 2010. Wells Fargo signed on as the first anchor funder of UnidosUS HOME initiative to create 4 million new Latino homeowners by 2030. We provided the initial grant to start a fund launched by FinTech Hello Alice to improve access to credit and capital for small business owners who are members of underserved groups, including women. We continue to open HOPE Inside centers in Wells Fargo branches, including six during the first half of 2023 with plans to reach 20 markets by the end of this year. The centers help empower community members to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching. We published our 2023 diversity, equity and inclusion report which highlights the progress we've made in our DE&I strategy and initiatives, both inside our company and the communities where we live and work. However, we have more work to do to achieve enduring results that will require long-term commitments. Looking ahead, the US economy continues to perform better than many expected and although there will likely be continued economic slowing and uncertainty remains, it is quite possible the range of scenarios will narrow over the next few quarters. This year's Federal Reserve stress test affirmed that we remain in a strong capital position, reflecting the value of our franchise and benefits of our operating model. This capital strength allows us to serve our customers' financial needs while continuing to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter comp stock dividend by 17% to $0.35 per share, subject to approval by the company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. We've repurchased $8 billion of common stock during the first half of this year and the stress test results demonstrated that we have the capacity to continue to repurchase common stock. Regulators have signaled that the Basel III Endgame proposal, which could be out as soon as this summer, will include higher capital requirements that will be skewed to the country's largest banks. While there's some speculation that capital requirements could increase by 20%, we don't know what the impact will be to Wells Fargo. However, we do expect our capital requirements will increase. While any changes to regulatory capital requirements are expected to be phased in gradually over several years, we are considering the potential impacts in contemplating the amounts of our future repurchases. Our balance sheet is strong. We've increased and remained focused on increasing our earnings capacity and continue to like our competitive position. We remain prepared for a variety of scenarios and our steadfast commitment to our risk and control build-out, coupled with our continued focus on financial and credit risk management, allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie. And good morning everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $4.9 billion or $1.25 per diluted common share, both up from a year ago, reflecting the progress we are making on improving our performance, which I\u2019ll highlight throughout the call. Starting with capital and liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.7%, down approximately 10 basis points from the first quarter. During the second quarter, we repurchased $4 billion in common stock and as Charlie highlighted, subject to Board approval, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 1.5 percentage points above our current regulatory minimum plus buffers and was 1.8 percentage points above our expected new regulatory minimum plus buffers starting in the fourth quarter of this year. While we expect to repurchase more common stock this year, we believe continuing to maintain significant excess capital is appropriate until there's more clarity on the new capital requirements that Charlie highlighted. Our liquidity position remained strong in the second quarter with our liquidity coverage ratio approximately 23 percentage points above the regulatory minimum. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. Overall credit quality remained strong, but as expected, net loan charge-offs continued to increase from historically low levels and were 32 basis points of average loans in the second quarter. Commercial net loan charge offs increased $137 million from the first quarter to 15 basis points of average loans. Approximately half of the increase was in commercial banking where the losses were borrower-specific with little signs of systematic weakness across the portfolio. The rest of the increase was driven by higher losses in commercial real estate, primarily in the office portfolio. I'll share some more details on the CRE office exposure on the next slide. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased modestly, up $23 million from the first quarter to 58 basis points of average loans. The increase primarily came from the credit card portfolio as residential mortgage loans continue to have net recoveries and auto losses declined. While consumer credit performance remained solid overall, and we\u2019ve continued to take incremental credit tightening actions across the portfolios, we expect consumer net loan charge-offs will continue to gradually increase. Non-performing assets increased 14% from the first quarter as lower non-accrual loans across the consumer portfolios were more than offset by higher commercial non-accrual loans, primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses increased $949 million in the second quarter, primarily from -- for commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card balances. We've updated Slide 6, which highlights our commercial real estate portfolio. We had $154.3 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the second quarter with $33.1 billion of office loans, which were down modestly from the first quarter and represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. The office market continues to be weak and the composition of our office portfolio was relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the first quarter. As Charlie mentioned, our CRE teams are focused on surveillance and de-risking which includes reducing exposures and closely monitoring at-risk loans. This quarter, we added a table to this slide that breaks down our CRE office disclosure in the context of our broader CRE portfolio. As the slide shows, our office loans at the end of the second quarter were primarily in corporate investment banking and that is also where we had the most non-accrual loans and the highest level of allowance for credit losses. Last quarter, we disclosed for the first time the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for the office portfolio in the corporate investment bank, which increased from 5.7% at the end of the first quarter to 8.8% at the end of the second quarter. This quarter, we are also providing our allowance for credit losses for our total CRE office portfolio which was 6.6% at the end of the second quarter, up from 4.4% at the end of the first quarter. As we highlighted last quarter, we're providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but each property situation is different and there are many variables that can determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis. For example, we have properties that are experiencing increased vacancies where borrowers have decided to inject equity and make investments to improve the property even in cities with more difficult fundamentals. We also have properties that are well leased and performing, but borrowers need help refinancing. In those situations, we are working with borrowers to restructure, which in many cases includes some paydown in balance. There are also situations that result in a sale or workout of the asset. We will continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help resolve issues that they may be facing. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were relatively stable from the first quarter and were up 2% from a year ago, driven by higher commercial and industrial loans in commercial banking and credit card loans. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 247 basis points from a year ago and 30 basis points from the first quarter due to the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 7% from a year ago, predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer and wealth businesses reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher yielding alternatives. While down from a year ago, average commercial deposits were relatively stable in the first quarter and average deposits grew in corporate and investment banking. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 30 basis points from the first quarter to 113 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to the rising interest rates. Our mix of non-interest bearing deposits declined from 32% in the first quarter to 30% in the second quarter but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Second quarter net interest income was $13.2 billion, up 29% from a year ago, as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $173 million decline from the first quarter was primarily due to lower deposit balances, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter. At the beginning of the year, we expected full year net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared with 2022. We currently expect full year 2023 net interest income to increase approximately 14% compared with 2022. There are a variety of factors that we've considered in our expectation for the rest of the year. We are assuming modest growth in loans, some additional deposit outflows and migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing deposits, as well as continued deposit repricing including competitive pricing on commercial deposits. Additionally, we are using the recent rate curve which is shown on the slide. As a reminder, many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain and we will need to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Non-interest expense grew $125 million or 1% from a year ago. At the beginning of the year, we expected our full year 2023 non-interest expense, excluding operational losses, to be approximately $50.2 billion. We currently expect our full year 2023 non-interest expense, excluding operating losses, to be approximately $51 billion. The increase includes higher severance expense due to actions we have taken and plan to take in 2023 as attrition has been slower than expected. Of note, we've reduced headcount each quarter since the third quarter of 2020 and headcount declined 1% from the first quarter and 4% from a year ago. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer small business banking revenue increased 19% from a year ago as higher net interest income, driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit related fees, driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. We continue to reduce the underlying costs around the business as customers migrate to digital, including mobile. We've reduced our number of branches by 4% and branch staffing by 10% from a year ago. Home lending revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to loan spread compression and lower mortgage originations. We continued to reduce headcount in the second quarter, down 37% from a year ago and we expect staffing levels will further decline during the second half of the year. Credit card revenue increased 1% from a year ago due to the higher loan balances. Payment rates were down from a year ago, but have been stable over the last three quarters, remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth remained strong, up 17% from a year ago and importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically. Auto revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue was up 17% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 77% from a year ago and increased 18% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality. We funded our last corresponding loan in the second quarter with our current focus being serving our bank customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for five consecutive quarters and balances were down 7% at the end of the second quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 11% from a year ago reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition. As Charlie highlighted, debit card spend was flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago, spending on fuel due to the lower gas prices, home improvement and travel are the largest declines compared to last year. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 13% from a year ago. Growth rates were stable throughout the second quarter with fuel the only category down year-over-year. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 51% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to higher loan balances. Average loan balances were up 12% in second quarter compared to a year ago, driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization. Average loan balances have grown for eight consecutive quarters thought the pace of growth has slowed. Average loans were up 1% from the first quarter with loan growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by seasonally higher inventory levels while middle market banking loans were flat. Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago, driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher lending revenue. The growth in investment banking fees from a year ago reflected write-downs taken in the second quarter of 2022 on unfunded leveraged finance commitments. Commercial real estate revenue grew 26% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Markets revenue increased 29% from a year ago, driven by the higher trading results across most asset classes. Our strong trading results during the first half of the year were driven by underlying market conditions and also reflected the benefit of our investments in technology and talent, which have allowed us to broaden our franchise and generate more trading flows. Average loans were down 2% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. The decline from the quarter was driven by banking, reflecting the combination of slow demand and modestly lower loan utilization. On Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago, driven by a decline in asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income from a year ago was driven by the impact of higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives. However, outflows into cash alternatives slowed in the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter. So second quarter results reflected the market valuations as of April 1, which were down from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the third quarter will reflect higher market valuations as of July 1. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, primarily due to decline in securities-based lending. Slide 15 highlights our Corporate results. Revenue increased $751 million from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and lower impairments of equity securities in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In summary, our results in the second quarter reflect a continued improvement in our earnings capacity. We grew revenue and had strong growth in pre-tax provision profit. As expected, our net charge-offs continue to slowly increase from historical lows and our allowance for credit losses increased. We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit-tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels remain strong and we continue to repurchase common stock. We will now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Mr. Usdin, please check the mute button on your phone. Charlie Scharf : Why don\u2019t we take another one and then we'll come back to Ken. Operator : Certainly. The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. It was great to see the higher NII guide and performance this quarter. That said it seems likely that dollars of NII will come down from here. I guess just broadly speaking, are you able to chat about what factors might be most important in sort of your ability to arrest a downward move in NII. In other words, kind of, when and why would it end up flattening out if we're ideally getting close to the end of a Fed tightening cycle? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, thanks, Scott. It\u2019s Mike. I'll take that and Charlie can jump in if you want. When you look at the assumptions that underpin that, and I highlighted some of this in my script, but I'll kind of go back through them. We've got a little bit of modest loan growth in there. So that's not a big driver of sort of what we're seeing. And I think you're probably seeing that from others where we're just not seeing that same demand that we saw a year or so ago on loans. We're also assuming that we'll see some additional outflows, particularly in the consumer space as people continue to spend money. And then we'll see some more migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing deposits. And then deposit pricing will -- betas will evolve over time. I think it's still very competitive on the commercial side and I think that will continue on the consumer side and then evolve. So I think you got to look at those combination of factors and make some assumptions around when you think they start to stabilize. But I think we're assuming that those trends that we've been seeing now for the last of quarters will continue, at least through the year end. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And maybe if we could drill down into one of those in particular, just the migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing. They've come down but are still above pre-pandemic levels, I believe. Do you have a sense for where and why those would start to settle out? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, I mean there's a few factors underneath that. As you pointed out, we're about 30% at the end of the quarter, down from about 32%, I think the prior quarter. And if you go back pre-COVID, they were in kind of the mid-20s, mid to upper-20s depending on when -- exactly when you look at it. And we've been trending downward. Part of that is excess deposits on the commercial side. As people use up their earnings credits for the fees they're paying, you're seeing some migration there. That stabilizes. And then you've seen again on the consumer side, people spending from their primary checking accounts. So those are the factors that I'd look at on when that starts to slow down and stabilize, but it's been pretty consistent at least for the last quarter or two. Scott Siefers : Yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you very much, Mike. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. So, Mike, thanks for the details on the CRE book. I think Charlie mentioned that you've gone through loan by loan in identifying and I appreciate the idiosyncratic nature of every sort of CRE loan. But given the reserve you've taken this quarter, give us a sense of your visibility around how well reserved the bank is today, knowing what we know in terms of the macro-outlook? And also if you can comment on just the rest of the CRE book, particularly as it relates to San Francisco or California and your level of comfort around just apartments et cetera within that market? Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, thanks. I'll take that, it\u2019s Mike. Broadly, I'll start on the broader point on CRE and then I'll come back to office. I think we've gone through the multifamily portfolio in quite a lot of detail. And I think -- no, I'm talking about the broader portfolio first, right? And so you talked about apartments in some cities. And so I think when you look at the broader portfolio including multifamily, it's all performing quite well. And I think you've seen certainly a slowing of growth rates in rents, but they're not declining in most cases. You're seeing good occupancy rates in many of the new construction that's coming online. And so overall, it feels quite constructive still for multifamily. And that same theme really applies to the rest of the portfolio. On office, that's the place where we're certainly seeing weakness. And as you think about the allowance we put up, we do have some very specific borrower loan level estimates of what we think could play out over the next quarter -- next couple -- next few quarters and that's embedded in the allowance. And then as you look at the rest of the office portfolio, we've gone through a number of stress scenarios and feel like at this point we're appropriately reserved to be able deal with what could be a number of different scenarios depending on how it plays out over time. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess just a separate question. You obviously have ample capital. Just Charlie, from your standpoint, how impactful is the asset cap today given the squeeze on the rest of the industry, I would think Wells would actually be gaining market share. But is the asset cap and all the regulatory issues, I'm not going to ask you to give us a timeline, but is that still a meaningful challenge in terms of your ability to take market share? Charlie Scharf : Well, I mean you can look at the size of our balance sheet and see where it is relative to the asset cap, which is a $1.952 trillion, I think? Mike Santomassimo : That\u2019s the asset cap. Charlie Scharf : Yeah, that's the actual cap, remember, which is a daily average over a couple of quarters. So relative to where we are operating today, we feel like we still have plenty of balance sheet to serve our customers and it's not standing in the way of that. Hasn't always been the case, but I think that's where we are today. But putting just the pure economics of the asset cap aside, it is something that, when we look at the work we have to get done, the fact that it's there is a statement of the reality that we still have more work to do. And so it's critical that we continue on our road to complete that work. And so that's the way we're thinking about it today. Mike Santomassimo : And maybe I'll just add one thing. When you look at some of growth opportunities we have, Charlie highlighted some of the investment banking hires we're making. In large part, we already have exposure out to the client base there. So now it's about making sure we got the right people to go after the fee opportunity, not necessarily extending a lot more balance sheet. The wealth management, the growth opportunity there, same theme. End even in the card space as we look at, the refresh product line is doing really well. We've got more to come there. And I think we've got plenty of room to continue to support many of the growth opportunities we have even if we didn't put out more -- have more exposure to support it. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Charlie Scharf : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So wanted to start off with a question just on the NII outlook. Certainly encouraging to see the guidance increase. But you noted, Mike, that it does contemplate a modest level of loan growth. And just parsing some of your other comments where you alluded to credit tightening, signs of slowdown in the broader economy, what gives you confidence around some inflection in lending activity, especially given the flattish loan growth that we've seen this quarter? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. Well, I think we're seeing -- we're certainly seeing growth in card. So I think we would expect that to continue. And then in the rest of the portfolios, we see a little bit of growth in the asset-based lending and leasing business in the commercial bank. Middle market is kind of flat, but at least this quarter, and then you can see the consumer items. So I think -- we're hopeful that we'll see some growth as we go into the second quarter. But as always, Steve, what we try to do with guidance is give you guidance that it doesn't necessarily require every assumption to go in our favor. So the bigger drivers of uncertainty around NII for the rest of the year continue to be the same ones we've been talking about now for the last couple of quarters. It's really going to be deposits and deposit pricing. The loan story will matter, but not anywhere near to the same degree. Steven Chubak : No, it's helpful color. And just a follow-up on expense, you cited the headcount reductions and higher severance cost driving some upward pressure this year. But just wanted to better understand how we should be thinking about the exit rate on expense. Once the headcount actions that you cited are fully captured in the run rate and whether there's any plans maybe redeploy some of the NII windfall to reinvest back in the business as we think about some of the potential benefits in the higher NII guidance you cited? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, I think our focus on expenses really hasn't changed over the last quarter or two. As we've talked about now for a while, we're going to continue to be very disciplined around the expense base. I think we're very much focused on making sure we execute and achieve the efficiencies that we've talked about. And as we get to year end, we'll sort of look at -- and after we do our work around the budget for next year, we'll go back through all the ups and downs like we normally do and give you some perspective there. But really the thinking around it hasn't changed. Charlie Scharf : And let me just add, Steve, if that\u2019s okay. I think when we laid out our expense guidance, we got a series of questions about how we think of the variability of that number and the environment and will the rest of our results impact that number. And I think as we look at how we're performing, I think we -- it wouldn't be hard for us to make a bunch of decisions to hit an expense number. But to the point is, we -- our results have been relatively strong. And so we are doing a series of things. I don't think about it as one-time expenses, but we have -- there is a fair amount of subjective expenses that relate to business development, product enhancements and things like that, that we do have the ability to each year, each quarter look at how we're performing and decide how much we want to spend. And so as we look forward, I think we're going to wait and see as we go through our budgeting process and we do a series of scenarios in terms of how things could play out next year and then make that determination. But as Mike said, I think we do separate out the fact that we continue to believe that there are continued opportunities to drive efficiency throughout the company. We're not going to lose sight of that. And that is separate from how much do we want to spend away from that. And we'll talk more about that towards the end of the year. Steven Chubak : Helpful color. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir. John Pancari : Good morning. I wanted to see if we can get some of your updated thoughts on buybacks here. CET1 10.7% and you indicated the $4 billion buyback in 2Q when you expect to continue to buyback from here. But obviously Basel III Endgame is a factor and I heard you on -- that you're contemplating buybacks as you look out from here. So could you maybe help frame that for us? What that could mean in terms of the pace of repurchases? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Not really any more than -- I think that's -- I think what we said is as much clarity as we want give at this time. I think we are -- we have substantial excess capital above the regulatory requirements and regulatory buffers and on top of the level of buffers that we have talked about running at. And so we think that's prudent given the fact that it's likely that capital requirements are going up. But the reality -- to answer the -- just in terms of the timing in terms of the ability to answer the question, from everything that we read is the same thing that you read, it's likely that we will learn later this month or early next month exactly what the proposal is. And based upon that, it will help us inform exactly how much room we have for buybacks. But in most of the scenarios that we see, there is room for us to continue the buyback program in a prudent way and still build required capital to whatever levels we'd have to require -- to be required to build them at and keep the kind of buffers that we want to keep. So there are bunch of moving pieces here. And so it just doesn't make to put any more numbers on it until we actually see what those proposals are. John Pancari : Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then separately on the NII side, again, appreciate the updated guide for \u201823 of the 14%. Maybe can you talk about -- when you look at the forward curve, what could be the forward curve implications for NII as you look further out into 2024, if we do reach a Fed fund of around 4% implied by the forward curve, how much of a headwind to NII could that be for you? And maybe also if you could just talk about the near-term deposit trajectory. I know you mentioned still continued decline, kind of if you can help frame that, size it up? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, John, I'm not going to give you much clarity on 2024. But I think the things you should think about obviously are going to be as rate -- on the commercial side, rate betas -- betas on the way up are pretty high, betas on the way down are pretty high. And the consumer side really hasn't moved much at this point. And so I do -- you sort of have to go into your modeling, looking at each of the components a little bit differently. And as we and I think many others have talked about over time, like once rates peak, there is likely some lag, continued repricing for a while after rates peak. And so you've got to think about all how that goes into your model. And then I think as I said in my script, I think we've seen pretty consistent performance across deposits over the last couple of quarters. And we're not seeing big shifts in behavior at this point. And so we'll see how that goes over the coming quarters. But there's still a lot of uncertainty in the assumptions that you go through that you have here. And so you got to make your best judgment on what you think is going to happen. But as you get closer to the end of the rate cycle, you\u2019ve probably seen a lot of the mix shift and repricing happening already. And so we'll see how that goes. Charlie Scharf : And can I just add? John Pancari : Thank you. Yeah. Charlie Scharf : Just even just more broadly, just to be clear about, we don't -- we're not looking specifically at giving guidance in terms of 2024 yet. But at the same time, just more broadly speaking, we are and have been out-earning in NII. And we've been very clear about that as we talk about getting towards our 15% ROTCE targets. It's in a more normalized environment. But at the same time, there are a series of things that we expect to be able to do as we look forward. A big part of it is growing the fees in the business as Mike spoke about. We're not constrained by the asset capital in our existing businesses. And a lot of the things that we're doing, whether it's in our wealth business, whether it's in the card business, whether it's in the corporate investment bank or middle market as well, we do expect to see the fruits of that labor. At the same time, we continue to stay very focused on expenses. And then the other thing I would just remind everyone is there's lots of conversations around charge-offs and things like that. But remember, we are all required when we think about CECL to be as forward-looking as we possibly can. You all know how we come up with the different scenarios. And so the level of reserving that's been running through our P&L, I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter we've added to reserves, which is what's impacting the EPS of the company, has been based upon an environment which at some point will be very different than what the expectation is sitting here. So I think, you add all those things together, and I just think it's important you think about all those things as opposed to just NII itself. Next question, operator. Operator : Certainly, we'll move on to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Charlie Scharf : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Just two follow ups. One on the reserve build in commercial real estate, and I know you discussed a bit already. I just wanted to understand how much of that was coming from really California, we all know there was a property that traded on California Street that sold at discount. So I'm just wondering how much of it is California office versus anything more broader based beyond that? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, Betsy, it's not isolated to California. I mean I think you see weakness in a lot of cities these days and it really comes down to property specific stuff. And even in California, we've got as many examples where clients are actually reinvesting in buildings, even if lease rates are low or even empty in some cases as they are going into a workout. So I think it really depends on building, borrower and all the things we sort of talked about in the script and it's less focused on just California. Charlie Scharf : Yeah, and I just want to reemphasize what Mike is saying and we talked about this in the prepared remarks, which is we have all spent a bunch of time going through a very detailed review of the office portfolio. Just the other day, we went through just a whole series of things that we're seeing. And I just really want to make the point, which I said in my script, it's not -- it's a very big mistake to think about loss content by looking at just where the property is. Again, we have examples in cities that are struggling where the structure of our loan is quite good. The underlying property has very high lease rates for an extended period of time. And then we can have a loan in a market which is doing well. But for whatever reason, that property -- the specific issue in that property, there are a bunch of potential termination dates in the shorter term. And so that's the level of detail that we've used look at to come up with what we think the appropriate level of reserving is. And I think we've tried to be as diligent as we can in stressing the scenarios that we see play itself out. So that when we look at ourselves and we understand what CECL reserving requires us to do, that's what we're trying to accomplish. Betsy Graseck : So would you -- and, I think we all know, like, for the most part commercial real estate loans are bullets, right, where the stress comes at the role. And I guess I'm wondering, is this reserve ad reflecting the entirety of the CRE book for that entirety of role rate risk or is this like a two-year forward? And part of the reason for asking the question is trying to understand if there's -- if how much risk there is for further increases in CRE related reserve builds? Charlie Scharf : Yeah, Mike, I\u2019ll start and then either chime in or give your opinion. We have tried to take into account all of the risks including refinance risk that exists in the portfolios looking at the current rate environment, cap rate expectations and things like that. Is it possible that we have to add something in the future because we learn more as time goes on? We would never say no. But again, what we're trying to do is be holistic in the review of the portfolio based upon everything that we know. And just as you can imagine, when we sit in the room with the people that run the real estate business and all the risk people, there's a range of opinion. There are people in there that say, we just -- it's hard to see losing this amount of money based upon what that individual thinks all of the underlying assumptions will play themselves out as. And then there are others where we say we actually want to stress the scenario because it is possible and we have to give weighting to that. And so that's how we come up with what this is. But again, we're trying to, again, I don't know, just -- we're trying to be forward-looking, we're trying to be holistic in all the risks that exist. And part of the reason to show you those -- that additional disclosure we made is so you can see exactly where the issues are relative to the rest of the office portfolio and the rest of CRE and isolate just the level of reserving that exists, which is, at this point is substantial. Betsy Graseck : Got it. I understand. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Mike, can you share with us, you touched on this a little bit in response to one of the earlier questions, but when you guys are looking at your balance sheet and you're measuring your treasury functions on your assets and liabilities, can you share with us what you're thinking for the second half of the year or into next year in terms of how you're managing that? And how that may be different than what -- how you positioned the balance sheet a year ago? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, George. Sure. It's not that different, right? On the margin, you may be making decisions to add a little duration here or there, but I'd say it's marginal at this point and we really haven't changed substantially how the balance sheet is positioned. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just to follow-up, I know you guys have given some good details here on working through the commercial real estate portfolio. And Mike, I think you said in your prepared remarks, in some cases, you've been able to get additional payments or equity investments from your borrowers to cure, maybe, a potential problem. Can you share with us some of the other workout solutions you're using so you can get through this period of adjustment that we're seeing in commercial real estate? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, I mean, sure. There's plenty of little structural enhancements you can make to feel better about it. And then there are also, in a lot of cases, getting some partial paydowns. And then you look at and you're trading those for refinancing term, And I think you give people a bit more time to work through these sets of issues. I think we try really hard not punt issues down the road. And so if there are real issues that we need to deal with, we try to deal with them in the moment. But there are a number of structural enhancements that we sort of work on with borrowers to get ourselves comfortable that we're setting the loan up for success. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on how you're interpreting the OCC and Fed joint statement that they put out on June 29, encouraging lenders to sign short-term or temporary loan accommodation solutions with their borrowers. Is that really anything new? Is that just standard operating procedure that they're reiterating or can this sort of help provide solutions that would allow you to work with your borrowers and perhaps delay classification -- deterioration and classification or classification to TDR? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, it's Mike. I'll take that. TDR doesn't exist anymore, but the -- that classification, but the guidance is very similar to what was issued originally back, I think, in 2009. Hasn't really changed much. And doesn't really change the way we've been interacting with our borrowers already in terms of really being proactive to work with them to find solutions to help them work through what could be difficult circumstances in some cases. So -- and it doesn't give you any leeway for how you classify criticized loans or other classification. So the intent is really to just be clear that people should continue to work with borrowers to find solutions, which is what we do all the time anyway. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just a follow-up question here. Thank you for the disclosure again on Slide 6. With $22 billion of your loans in CIB, I think investors are wondering what is the average loan size there? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, I don't think that's something we give and there is a wide range. Average sometimes are very misleading. And so there's a wide range. And what really matters is not the loan size, it really matters -- what really matters is all the variables Charlie talked about earlier in terms of what's happening with that property. So I think that would be -- I think I would focus there. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just squeezing in one more question. And before I ask this expense question, Charlie, I think your investors very much appreciate it that you're not just doing whatever you can to hit an expense number and you're reinvesting back into the company. So to that and I'm wondering if have you disclosed how much of the $800 million increase in the outlook for this year has to do with severance? Mike Santomassimo : We didn't give an exact number, but that is by far the single largest piece of it, that's part of it. And there's some other exit costs for properties as we to exit some lease space and other things. But that is -- the severance is by far the largest piece. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I want to follow-up Charlie on some of your prepared remarks. You talked about there's still some things that you're implementing to address regulatory issues and wondering if you can give a couple of examples of what still needs to be done in terms of implementation and when you expect that to be completed? Charlie Scharf : Listen, I think -- as we've said, there's a lot of work to do. It is multi-years\u2019 worth of deliverables. What we've -- what I've said is that we've implemented a lot, but we still have more to do. And when I say that, I just want to be clear, I'm speaking in -- everyone generally thinks I'm speaking about one of the consent orders which has the asset cap. We're thinking about all of the work that we have to do related to all the consent orders and the work to build the control environment. And there is a lot getting done. But ultimately what matters, you don't get an A for effort in this. It's about getting things over the finish line on time and getting them done with the quality that our regulators and we expect from each other. And so as you know, we've been very careful not to put dates out there because we have to do our work and then our regulators have to take a look at it and see if it's done to their satisfaction. We don't want to get ahead of that process, but we continue to move forward. Matt O\u2019Connor: And I understand that you can't speak for them signing off on what you've done, but in terms of you accomplishing what you want to accomplish, where are you on that kind of process, like whether you want to frame it from an innings perspective or percent basis? Anyway to frame that, acknowledging there's a lot to do and that you've done a lot. But how far along are you in terms of what you can control on implementing these things? Charlie Scharf : Yeah. Listen, I appreciate your desire to have me answer those questions. But again, all that matter -- our view of accomplishing the work doesn't matter. What matters is that our regulators look at it and say it's done to their satisfaction. So I really don't think it's helpful or productive to go beyond what I've said at this point. But again, I do understand and appreciate why you're asking. Matt O\u2019Connor: Understood and fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks. A quick one. Mike or Charlie, can you give us the maturity schedule? What percentage or amount of your office CRE loans are maturing in the second half and into 2024? Mike Santomassimo : Not specifically, Vivek, we don't disclose that. But you should assume these are standard course loans in the commercial real estate space, which are generally three to five-year loans. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And you haven't really been originating much in the last couple of years. So I guess we could go back to looking at, when did you slowdown the origination of new office CRE, Mike? Was it two years ago? Was it three? Any color on that? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. Look, I think you have to remember that we've been refinancing existing facilities along that time period. So -- but I think if you take the portfolio and assume some kind of basic average life based on what I said, I think you'll get a pretty good sense of the approximate maturity schedule. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And how about multifamily? What's the average life of those loans and maturities there? I recognize your -- I heard your comments that those are in much better position given all the factors you already cited. Mike Santomassimo : Slightly longer, a few years longer than office. Vivek Juneja : Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator : And our final question for today's call will come from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. Your line is open, sir. Charles Peabody : Good morning. Most of my questions were already asked and answered, but just I want to follow-up on the consent order issues. If I call correctly and please correct me if I'm wrong, there's six consent orders remaining and three of them, if I remember, deals somewhat with the mortgage banking operation. And I know starting last fall, you started the planning effort to simplify and downsize that and you've been executing on that this year. Can you give us a sense of what it is you need to do in mortgage banking related to those consent orders? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, sure. It\u2019s Mike. So first of all, there are nine public consent orders out there that are all there. So you can see those. When you look at the mortgage ones, I think that each of the consent orders is actually quite clear in terms of what needs to happen to satisfy those. So I would just point you back to the documents themselves, which can give you a pretty good sense of what it is and each one is a little bit different. Charles Peabody : Follow-up, and do you talk to the regulators about the progress you're making in mortgage banking on a monthly basis, quarterly basis, semi-annual or do you present something at the end? How does the interaction with the regulators go? Mike Santomassimo : We talk to our regulators all the time, at all parts of the company, at all levels of the company. And so you should assume we're actively engaged consistently with our regulators all the time. Charlie Scharf : But the only thing I would add to that is, but again, they're here, they're on-site, we talk to them literally all the time. Charles Peabody : Right. No, I understand that, but specifically related to the progress you're making\u2026 Charlie Scharf : Just give me a second. We talk to them about everything. And given the importance of the consent orders, you can assume it's about the work that's going on in the underlying consent order. But having said all of that, what matters is the work that they do at the end of the consent order after we submit it to them. And so they can be up to speed on what we're doing. They can know how we feel about the progress that we're making. But when we submit a consent order to them, they come in and do their holistic review. And so that's really where their determination is made about whether or not it's done to their satisfaction. So again, that just gets to the reason why I want to be very careful about not drawing any conclusions from our view on our work or any interim comments we might get from them. What really matters is the holistic review that they do and the process that they go through internally in the regulatory organizations. Charles Peabody : So that was part of my first question is have you submitted anything yet on mortgage banking? Charlie Scharf : We're not going to talk about that. I said that over and over and over again. Charles Peabody : All right. Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Thank you very much everyone. We appreciate the time and we'll talk to you all soon. Operator : Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Welcome and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.  Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financials referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.  I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charles Scharf : Thanks very much, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some third quarter highlights. Our results reflected the progress we're making to improve our financial performance. Revenue, pretax provision profit, net income, diluted earnings per common share and ROTCE were all higher than a year ago. Our revenue reflected strong net interest income growth as well as higher noninterest income as we benefited from higher rates and the investments we're making in our businesses. Our expenses declined from a year ago due to lower operating losses. As expected, net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels, and we increased our allowance for credit losses primarily driven by our office portfolio as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the second quarter as higher rates and a slowing economy have weakened loan demand, and we've continued to take some credit tightening actions.  Average deposits also declined from the second quarter and a year ago driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives. Consumer spending remains strong with third quarter year-over-year growth rates for both credit and debit card spending increasing from the second quarter.  Now let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with risk and control work, which remains our top priority. As time goes on, we continue to make the progress necessary to complete our work. I've said that we have detailed project plans which track interim deliverables, not just the date the work is to be finalized and turned over to the regulators for validation.  The work is not finalized all at once. It's not as if there's a big bang conversion at the conclusion of a big body of work. It's just the opposite. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort. We are implementing changes throughout the life of the project, and we track effectiveness along the way.  The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment, but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. We remain focused on the work ahead even as we are making progress. But I will repeat what I've said in the past : regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow. And until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. Additionally, until our work is complete, we could find new issues that need to be remediated, and these may result in additional regulatory actions.  We also continued to take steps to advance our business strategy, which includes focusing on our core business and customers. We sold approximately $2 billion of private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We are also making a number of investments to better serve our customers. As a leader in U.S. middle-market and asset-based lending, we're focused on finding ways to support our clients with the recently announced strategic relationship with Centerbridge Partners. Our middle-market clients will have greater access to alternative sources of capital that can be used to pursue a broader set of growth and value-creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions. Branches continue to play an important role in the way we serve our customers, and we continue to optimize our network, but we also look at targeted expansions in markets where we see opportunities for our franchise.  Last week, we announced we are expanding our branch network in Chicago, where we only have 7 branches today. We also continue to make enhancements to our mobile app. And in the third quarter, we launched Stock Fractions, giving Wells trade clients the ability to buy fractions of company's stocks to help build a diversified portfolio regardless of stock price.  Just yesterday, we announced the expanded availability of LifeSync to all consumer customers. Available on the mobile app, LifeSync is our personalized digital approach to aligning customers' goals with their money and was launched to all Wealth and Investment Management clients earlier this year. Customers' goals entered in LifeSync will be visible to bankers to enhance need-based conversations. We also expanded the capabilities of Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant and recently added the ability for customers to communicate with Fargo in Spanish. These enhanced capabilities are just the latest of our ongoing investments to deliver seamless and consistent experiences across all our channels. We are seeing more mobile adoption momentum, adding over 520,000 mobile active users in the third quarter, our best quarterly growth since first quarter of 2021.  We've also continued to make important hires who bring expertise to Wells Fargo and businesses we're looking to grow. Before I highlight some of our new leaders, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Bill Daley, Vice Chairman of Public Affairs, who's retiring at the end of this year for all he has accomplished since he joined the company in 2019. Bill has been an invaluable asset to the company, and we benefited from his long experience in both the public and private sectors. During this time at Wells Fargo, he helped strengthen our relationships with communities we serve, established new programs in housing and small business, and worked to rebuild our reputation both locally and nationally.  I'm pleased to have announced that Tom Nides joined Wells Fargo as Vice Chairman earlier this month. Tom will be a close adviser to the senior management team on a range of issues, and we will work alongside our business leaders as we continue to expand our relationships with clients. The breadth of Tom's experience across the public and private sectors will be an important asset to us as we continue to move the company ahead. We continue to invest in our Corporate Investment Banking business with new co-heads of equity capital markets. These new hires complement the other important hires we've been making over the past year. We also hired a new Head of Trust Services and Chief Fiduciary Officer in our Wealth and Investment Management segment and a new Head of Affluent and Premier Banking in consumer, small and business banking.  We also continue to focus on better serving our communities. During the third quarter, we published 3 reports that provided overview of the work we are doing to build a sustainable, inclusive future in communities we serve; outline our strategic approach to managing the risks associated with climate change in deploying capital to support the transition to a low-carbon economy; and describe our methodology for aligning our financial portfolios with pathways to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and presenting interim emissions-based targets to track that alignment. We continue to make progress on our special-purpose credit program initiative we announced last year to help drive economic growth, sustainable homeownership and neighborhood stability in minority communities. We recently expanded our special-purpose refinance offers to prequalified Hispanic customers with Wells Fargo mortgages to refinance at a lower than market rate. The program launched last year for Black or African American customers has seen strong results, and the Hispanic offer has shown similar levels of customer engagement.  We also announced that we're offering a $10,000 homebuyer access grant that will be applied towards down payment for eligible homebuyers who currently live and work purchasing homes in certain underserved communities in 8 metropolitan areas. And we now have 14 HOPE Inside centers of Wells Fargo branches, including the first focusing on serving the Navajo community. The centers help engage and empower communities to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching.  Looking ahead, the U.S. economy has continued to be resilient with key support from the labor and strength -- from the labor market and strength in consumer spending. Delinquencies have continued to deteriorate at a relatively slow consistent rate without signs of acceleration across our portfolios. Our base case remains a continued slowing of the economy, but we remain prepared for a wide range of scenarios given there is still significant uncertainty ahead. Regarding capital, the Basel III Endgame proposal included higher capital requirements as we expected. It's a complicated set of rules. But at this point, if nothing changed and we didn't take actions, we estimate that our RWA would increase by approximately 20%. There are some items that increased our capital requirements that we are hopeful will be adjusted, and we will be participating and sharing our perspectives on the proposed rules during the 120-day comment period.  Additionally, we are evaluating changes we may make based on the proposed rules. Fortunately, we come into this from a strong position as our current capital levels are above the estimated regulatory minimum plus buffers. However, we still need to decide how much of an additional buffer we want to maintain and what mitigating actions we may want to take to reduce the impact of the new rules.  At this point, we still see a path to concurrently increasing our level of CET1 as appropriate, increasing our dividend and repurchasing common stock. Levels of each will be influenced by CCAR, the finalization of the proposed rules and economic conditions.  I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Michael Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.48 per diluted common share, both up from the second quarter and a year ago. Our third quarter results included $349 million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period tax matters.  Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11% in the third quarter, 2.1 percentage points above our new regulatory minimum plus buffers effective on October 1. This was up from 10.7% in the second quarter as higher earnings, the approximately 14 basis point benefit from the sale of certain private equity investments and lower risk-weighted assets were only partially offset by share repurchases and dividends.  During the third quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion in common stock. Our strong capital levels position us well for the anticipated increases related to the Basel III Endgame proposal released in the third quarter. Based on where we ended the quarter, we estimate that our CET1 ratio would be 50 basis points above the fully phased-in required minimum if the proposed rules were implemented as written after factoring the growth in RWAs and the resulting decline in our stress capital buffer as well as the impact of the new G-SIB buffer calculation changes.  Importantly, this is an early estimate, subject to change and is before any actions we may take to mitigate the impact of the new rules. Looking forward, we expect to continue to have capacity to increase our CET1 ratio, while we plan to continue to repurchase shares as we wait for the capital rules to be finalized.  Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. As we expected, net loan charge-offs continue to increase, up 4 basis points from the second quarter to 36 basis points of average loans. Commercial net loan charge-offs declined modestly from the second quarter to 13 basis points of average loans as lower losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio were partially offset by $14 million of higher losses in commercial real estate.  We had $32.2 billion of office loans, down 3% from the second quarter, which represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. Vacancy rates continue to be high and the office market remains weak. Our CRE teams continue to focus on monitoring and derisking the portfolio, which includes reducing exposures.  As we highlighted in the past, each property situation is different and there are many variables that could determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio. As expected, consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up $98 million from the second quarter to 67 basis points of average loans. Residential mortgage loans continued to have net recoveries, while our other consumer portfolios all had higher losses with the largest increase in our auto portfolio, which was up from the second quarter seasonal lows. Nonperforming assets increased 17% from the second quarter as growth in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans more than offset the decline in commercial and industrial as well as modest declines across all consumer portfolios. The decline in commercial industrial nonaccrual loans was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns, which is a good reminder that the resolution of nonperforming assets doesn't always result in charge-offs. The increase in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans was driven by a $1.3 billion increase in the office nonaccrual loan.  Moving to Slide 6. Our allowance for credit losses increased $333 million in the third quarter primarily for commercial real estate office loans as well as for higher credit card loan balances, which was partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. Since the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the past few quarters, we did not include a separate commercial real estate slide this quarter. However, we did update the table showing the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio.  We've not seen significant increases in charge-offs in our commercial real estate office portfolio yet. However, we do expect higher losses over time, and we continue to increase the coverage ratio in our commercial and -- in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio from 8.8% at the end of the second quarter to 10.8% at the end of the third quarter.  On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down modestly from both the second quarter and a year ago. While we continue to have good growth in credit card loans from the second quarter, most other portfolios declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 195 basis points from a year ago and 24 basis points from the second quarter due to the higher interest rate environment.  Average deposits declined 5% from a year ago predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer and wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Average deposits also declined in Commercial Banking, while they stabilized in Corporate and Investment Banking.  As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 23 basis points from the second quarter of 236 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. However, the pace of the increase has slowed, and our percentage of average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased modestly from the second quarter to 29% but remained above prepandemic levels.  Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Third quarter net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 8% from a year ago, as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $58 million decline from the second quarter was due to lower average deposit balances, partially offset by 1 additional day in the quarter and the impact of higher interest rates.  Last quarter, we increased our expectations for full year 2023 net interest income growth to approximately 14% compared with 2022, which was up from our expectation of 10% growth at the beginning of the year. We now expect full year 2023 net interest income growth to grow by approximately 16% compared with 2022 with the fourth quarter 2023 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.7 billion. The expected decline in interest income in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by our assumptions for additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits as well as continued deposit repricing, including continued competitive pricing on commercial deposits.  Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses and increased 1% from the second quarter driven by higher operating losses, severance expense and revenue-related comp. Last quarter, we updated our expectations for full year 2023 noninterest expense excluding operating losses to approximately $51 billion. We now expect it to be approximately $51.5 billion or approximately $12.6 billion in the fourth quarter. The increase reflects additional severance and other onetime costs, revenue-related compensation and some lags in realizing efficiency saves.  We've reduced head count every quarter since the third quarter of 2020, and it was down 3% in the second quarter and 5% from a year ago. We believe we still have additional opportunities to reduce head count and attrition has remained low, which will likely result in additional severance expense for actions in 2024. We are working through our efficiency plans now as part of the budget process.  Additionally, if the FDIC deposit special assessment related to the events from earlier in the year was finalized in the fourth quarter, it would increase our expected fourth quarter expenses. And finally, as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating results.  Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer, small and business banking revenue increased 7% from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. Charlie highlighted the investments we were making in our Chicago branch network, and we're also making investments in refurbishing branches across our existing network. Additionally, we are bringing our digital onboarding experience to our branches, creating a fast and easy experience for our customers. At the same time, we've reduced our total number of branches by 6% from a year ago.  Home lending revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to a decline in mortgage banking income driven by lower originations in servicing income, which included the impact of sales of mortgage servicing rights. We continue to reduce head count in home lending in the third quarter, down 37% from a year ago, and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline.  Credit card revenue increased 2% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by introductory promotional rates and higher credit card rewards expense. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above prepandemic levels. New account growth continued to be strong, up 22% from a year ago, reflecting the continued success of our new products and increased marketing. Importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically. While the majority of new cards were to existing Wells Fargo customers, we're increasingly attracting more customers that are new to Wells Fargo. Auto revenue declined 15% from a year ago driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue is up 14% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.  Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 18% in the second quarter. We continue to make progress on the strategic plans we announced earlier this year, including focusing on serving Wells Fargo Bank customers as well as borrowers in minority communities. We did not originate or fund any correspondent mortgages in the third quarter. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for 6 consecutive quarters, and balances were down 9% at the end of the third quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volumes declined 24% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions as well as continued price competition. Our origination mix continue to shift towards higher FICO scores, reflecting the credit tightening actions we've taken over the past year. Debit card spend increased 2% from a year ago with growth in most categories offsetting declines in fuel, home improvement and travel. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew from a year ago, including fuel, which rebounded after declining in the second quarter.  Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle Market Banking revenue increased 23% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 3% year-over-year due to higher loan balances as well as higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Loan balances were up 7% in the third quarter compared to a year ago driven by growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing. Average loans were down 1% in the second quarter due to declines in Middle Market Banking. After increasing the first half of the year, revolver utilization rates declined in the third quarter to levels similar to a year ago.  Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 20% from a year ago driven by higher lending revenue, stronger treasury management results reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, and higher investment banking revenue reflecting increased activity across all products. As Charlie highlighted, we've continued to hire experienced bankers, helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well when markets improve.  Commercial real estate revenue grew 14% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher revenue in our low-income housing business, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets revenue increased 33% from a year ago driven by higher revenue in structured products, equities, credit products and foreign exchange. We've had strong trading results for 3 consecutive quarters as we benefited from market volatility and the investments we've made in technology and talent to grow this business. Average loans were down 5% from a year ago driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slower demand payoffs and modestly lower line utilization. Average loan balances were stable with the second quarter.  On Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 1% compared to a year ago driven by higher asset-based fees due to the increased market valuations. Net interest income declined from a year ago driven by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives as well as lower loan balances. While average deposits were down compared to both the second quarter and a year ago, the pace of the decline slowed in the third quarter. As a reminder, the majority of WIM, Wealth and Investment Management advisory assets were priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected market valuations as of July 1, which were higher from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the fourth quarter will reflect market valuations as of October 1, which were also higher from a year ago but were lower from the third quarter pricing date. Average loans were down 4% from a year ago primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending.  Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. This segment includes venture capital and private equity investments, including the investments and funds that we sold in the third quarter. The sale had a nominal impact on third quarter net income. Revenue declined $345 million from a year ago, reflecting assumption changes related to the valuation of our Visa B common stock exposure as well as lower venture capital revenue.  In summary, our results in the third quarter reflect a continued improvement in our financial performance. During the first 9 months of this year, we had strong growth in revenue, pretax provision profit and diluted earnings per share compared to a year ago. As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase from historical lows, and we increased our allowance for credit losses by over $1.9 billion this year primarily for CRE office loans and higher credit card loan balances. We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels have increased, and we expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders.  We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we will take our first question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. John McDonald : I wanted to ask about the expenses, Mike. Obviously, improving efficiency has been a big goal of yours. You made progress even while investing in regulatory. What are the additional opportunities to improve efficiency from here as you head into 2024? I know you're probably not ready to give guidance for '24 yet, but are you going into the budget planning with a mindset that they should be roughly flattish? Any comments you can give on that would be helpful. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Sure. Thanks, John. First off, let's just make sure we keep it all in context, right? We set out a program almost 3 years ago now to cut roughly $10 billion. And I think that's all still on track. We've brought head count down 40,000 from -- or closer to 50,000 from the peak back in . So sort of very good progress to date. And I think as Charlie and I have both said over the last couple of quarters, we still have more to do to make it more efficient. And I would say there are very few parts of the company that we would say are optimized at this point. Now some have more opportunity than others, some require investment in terms of automation and technology, some don't.  But I do think that we go into the budget process and even just how we operate every quarter with a very disciplined approach to every single area of the company saying, what are we going to do to continue to drive more efficiency there while we make investments as well. And we highlighted some of those that we've been making on in the prepared remarks. But I think it's the same mindset we've been bringing to it now for the last few years, and I think we're going to continue to do that. Where that ultimately ends up, we'll share for next year. We'll share with you in January, like we always do. John McDonald : Okay. Fair enough. And then on the net interest income outlook for the fourth quarter, are you building in assumptions -- you mentioned deposit outflows and mix shift assumptions? Are they assuming that things accelerate from here or similar to what you've seen this quarter? It seems like a pretty big sequential decline. Just kind of wondering what some of the assumptions are there. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. No, look, I think as you can -- as we've talked about over the last -- it feels like forever, but certainly last 4, 5, 6 quarters now, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of how the path of both the deposits and pricing will shape up. Whether it's all the quantitative tightening, all of the -- any competitive reactions we may see from others. And so I think we continue to think that we're going to see these trends appear at some point. Now we've been pleasantly surprised this -- to date this year that hasn't progressed as fast as we thought it would, but at some point, it will. And so hopefully, we'll find ourselves in a position where it doesn't move as maybe fast as we've modeled in terms of pricing.  But we still -- all those trends are going to happen and are happening as you look at shifts between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing, you're seeing deposit costs continue to increase. And on the consumer side, you see people spending their money. And so exactly at what pace those things are all going to keep going as we certainly modeled it, but we try to give you a base case forecast that we can hit under a bunch of different scenarios, and this is the same. Operator : The next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So wanted to start, Charlie, because you had made some comments about capital targets and those potentially evolving. The inflation RWA from Basel III Endgame that you guided to does bring your CET1 minimum to 8.5%. You alluded subtly, mind you, to the possibility of managing to a lower target. Since 150 bps management cushion does feel excessive, what are some of the factors that would compel you to maintain a larger cushion than peers and maybe continue to run at or above 10%? Charles Scharf : Well, let me just -- I'll start and then I'll hand it over to Mike. We were not trying to -- or I was not trying to give any direction about where we thought the appropriate buffer would be. We're just trying to be very factual about where we are. And once everything is finalized, we'll determine what the right buffers are and we'll communicate those. So please don't try and read any more into what I said other than just that. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. And I think, Steve, I know your estimate might be 150 basis points. But I think what we've talked about over time is that at least at this point, we've been saying our buffer is probably closer to 100% -- 100 basis points over wherever the right minimum might be. And that may evolve, as Charlie said. I think as you look at Basel III, the increase in RWA is driven by the things that are probably pretty obvious, whether it's operational risk plus the -- some of the other factors. But operational risk is certainly going to be one of the bigger pieces of it. And so I really do think that we have to see how the final rule shakes out next year.  We're hopeful that there'll be some changes to areas that we think just makes sense from aligning sort of the capital requirements to the risk while also maybe moderating some of the operational risk increases as well. And so we're going to engage as we go there. But one of the factors that we've talked about now for a while in terms of how big our buffer should be is that we needed the rules to be finalized and so could that lead you to having a slightly smaller buffer than what we would have had in the past? Potentially. But I think we have to get there and get these finalized, and then we'll also take actions once we have good clarity on what's going to change or not change as we go over the next year. So I mean, we're probably 9 months to 12 months away from getting a final rule, and so we still have a little bit of time for this to play out. Steven Chubak : And for a follow-up, just on the trading business. It continues to surprise positively versus expectations. You cited some of the investments that you've made, the benefits of volatility. But with revenues running multiples above what we've seen in prior years and that $1 billion-plus bogey being reached for 3 consecutive quarters, I was hoping you could just speak to whether we should be underwriting $1 billion-plus as a new normal or if there were any cyclical benefits or anomalous benefits that maybe we shouldn't be underwriting go forward. Just trying to think about what the normalized level of trading revenue should be given some of the investments you've made scaling of that business. Michael Santomassimo : Yes, I'll take that. Look, I think we've -- as you said, we've just been methodically investing in the capabilities with a focus on supporting our core clients more than -- more -- with more capabilities versus like trying to expand the scope of what we do in a way that just doesn't fit who we are. And so I think that's what you've seen us try to do there in those businesses. So businesses like FX and rates and just -- it's sort of methodically sort of adding people in a couple of slots or improving technology.  And we've certainly been the benefit of some volatility in the market this year. So as you know, that could change pretty quickly one way or the other. But I think as we look at some of these businesses, what we're focused on is just adding more clients, more flows, more incrementally each month and each quarter. And so whether it ends up being $1 billion plus or minus a quarter -- per quarter, I think we'll see as we go, but we're pretty pleased with what we've seen so far.  And there isn't a big onetime event that happened in the quarter that drove the results. And so that's good to see as well. And you're also not seeing big growth in market risk RWA as we do this as well. And so that's part of what we've been trying to do as well is kind of sweat the balance sheet more and make sure that we're getting paid for the exposure and the risk we've got there. And so we're happy to see that, it's starting to come together. And we're under no illusions, though, that 3 quarters is like success, right? We've got to do this over a long period of time and continue to add capabilities and clients. Operator : The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Robert Siefers : Was hoping maybe, Mike, you could spend another moment sort of discussing RWA mitigation in light of the Fed capital proposals. I guess, specifically, I was hoping for maybe a little more color. I know you touched on it in some of the earlier remarks, but the sale of the $2 billion in private equity. And then maybe if you could also discuss the new agreement with Centerbridge for direct lending, just sort of how all these factor into your thinking here. Michael Santomassimo : Sure. When you look at mitigation -- I'll just give you some examples of the types of things we're thinking about. So when you look at securities finance transactions, you have haircut -- collateral haircut floors that get implemented. And I don't want to get too technical on it because -- but there's some technical requirements there that just don't seem to make sense to us. And so -- but if they do get implemented as written, we'll adapt and we'll change the way we -- what collateral we require from clients to do trades or we'll reprice them. And so there'll be a number of things that we can do like on transactions like that, but it gets very, very technical for each of the underlying deals. There will be -- I know others have talked about this, too. We'll have to decide how much tax equity investing we do in renewables. If the risk weights hold there, it's just -- the math just doesn't make sense from a return perspective. And so we'll probably have to do less -- we'll probably do less of those. And so there's a number of things like that as you go through each of the underlying portfolios just don't make sense. And we're going to -- we'll make the adjustments as we need to. Now we're also in a position where we've got plenty of flexibility as we talked about in the prepared remarks, right? Our capital levels today are there with a buffer already. And so we have the flexibility to handle it however we think makes sense to -- for each of the underlying businesses. And what we want to make sure we do is like we're building real businesses and client relationships over a long period of time. So it's not about necessarily walking away from clients. It's about finding ways to serve them in ways that both makes sense for them and from a return perspective for us. But it's going to be a very, very granular conversation. Some of it will be repricing. You got 364-day revolvers that will need to be repriced. You've got -- there's a whole bunch of very technical things like that, that will get done over time once the rule is finalized. Switching to the partnership we have with Centerbridge. Look, it's a -- we have been getting demand from clients for a while now in the middle-market kind of mid-corporate space for solutions to help them in financing that they need where it likely wouldn't make sense for us to put on our balance sheet anyway. And so instead of having telling clients we can't help them or having them go direct to somebody else, we built a partnership with Centerbridge that allows us to remain an adviser to a client and help them solve a problem they may have. And so that's the way we're thinking about it. And we're excited to work with Centerbridge and that team, and they're a very high-quality team, they have done a lot over time. And I think this gives us another arrow in the quiver to help us provide solutions for clients. And so it's early, and it will grow over time, hopefully. And hopefully, clients will see it in the same way. Robert Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And then maybe as a follow-up, might want to revisit -- or I was hoping to revisit the NII discussion for a bit. I certainly appreciate all the comments on continuing mix shift and deposit pricing pressure. But I guess, as we get to this level at the end of the year, is the thought that there would still be on balance downward pressure on NII beyond that? Or is -- as you see it, is there enough kind of asset repricing opportunity that would ultimately allow things to settle out maybe sooner as opposed to later? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I mean we'll see. I think we do need to wait until we get towards the end of the year and into January for us to give you a real view on 2024. I mean, I think what the last number of quarters have -- just show over and over and over that there's a lot still to play out here. And to get too far ahead of ourselves on it for next year, I think, would be a mistake at this point. So -- but look, the same -- it's the same drivers we've been talking about for a while, right? It's like what's going to happen with deposits, the mix, the pricing. And then to a lesser degree, right now, it's loan growth, but it still matters over a long period of time as well. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Can you just elaborate on the comment of tightening the credit box a bit? And then, I guess, specifically in credit card, thoughts there? I know you've been leaning into it and have had real good growth. And I think it's still only about 5% of your loan book, but wondering your thoughts of, is this really the right time to be leaning into credit card maybe as we're kind of later cycle. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I'll start with credit card and come back to the broader point. So we started on a journey to transform that -- the card business back in the fourth quarter of '19, so right after really Charlie started. And what we've done since then is really refreshed -- almost completely refreshed the product line. We still have a little bit more to do there. And so part of what you're seeing come through in the results is actually putting out good products that people want to buy. And you're seeing really -- we have really good new account growth in the quarter, probably our best quarter in quite some time. And so it starts with just having a good product and good service behind it, and that's the key driver, I think, of what you're seeing here. On the credit side on the new originations, the new accounts we're adding are really good relative to the back book. And when you look at both -- and even when you dig a little bit deeper there, there's -- the majority of them are still Wells Fargo Bank customers, but we're seeing more and more traction with non-Wells Fargo customers, so first-time customers. And when you look at those first time to Wells customers, those -- the credit profile is really good. And so we feel comfortable with like the risks that's being added there. And we're going to continue to look for pockets of risk. And if we see them, we'll tighten it down. But in terms of what we're seeing in originations, we feel good about what we're seeing so far. Just more broadly on credit, we've said now for probably the last 4 or 5 quarters, we've been kind of incrementally tightening the credit box on the consumer side for a while. Whether it's really across the board in home lending, auto, card, personal loans, really every single one of them had some credit tightening. And it's been a bit incremental over the last 4 or 5 quarters. And so I would still sort of think of that as like taking that last 1% or 2% or 3% of origination out that doesn't make sense in what could be a more difficult economic environment. It's not wholesale shifts in sort of the approach or the underlying box that we're operating in. It's really sort of modest and incremental. And then on the... Charles Scharf : Just on -- and just to be clear, I mean it's -- and it's the very basic stuff. It's just upping the lower FICO boundaries, it's layered risks. And so it's just as you continue to make these changes, you just -- we're just continuing to do the same types of things without just wholesale exits or anything like that. It's just kind of a smart tightening. Michael Santomassimo : Yes. And then outside the consumer space -- outside of consumer, really the only place that we've meaningfully tightened credit over the last couple of years or a few years is commercial real estate. And other than that, I think there's probably some minor tinkering, but we haven't really changed the appetite much outside of commercial real estate. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a clarification on the severance costs. Can you give us what the absolute amount was this quarter? I think you gave us the change versus a year ago and linked quarter. But what was the absolute level this quarter? Michael Santomassimo : Yes, there wasn't a lot a year ago, so it's not far off of the total. So a small difference, but it's -- there wasn't a lot. Matthew O\u2019Connor: Okay. So about $200 million? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. And again, that will sort of evolve as we go. I mentioned that in my script as we look at next year and the attrition rates that we're seeing. Operator : The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. John Pancari : On the commercial real estate front, I know you cited the increase in the office loan loss reserve from -- in the CIB from 8.8% to 10.8%. Could you just comment there in terms of what were some of the anecdotal drivers for the loan loss reserve increase? Do you think you could have incremental increases here? And maybe cite some of the office revaluations you've seen as you have seen with the underlying collateral change hands or reappraisals, if you can give us some color there as well. Michael Santomassimo : Yes, sure. When you -- the hard part of office right now is that there aren't a lot of trades happening yet, right? There's a few in certain cities, and they're all a little bit different in their complexion. So you still have somewhat limited information in price discovery in a lot of places. And so we're doing -- we do a lot of our own work to try to evaluate each of the underlying properties and what they could be worth in a bunch of different scenarios. And then it's feeling like the appraisal market is starting to kind of catch up, where they're -- we're seeing appraisals that are more realistic and more updated. So that's certainly bringing in different data points as we look at it. And as we looked at the quarter, we sort of look at all those data points and the underlying loans and try to do our best to come up what we think the different range of loss could look like here, and that's what's embedded in the results. Hopefully, we end up being conservative. But nonetheless, it's possible that this plays out this way. And so we haven't really seen any losses of significant yet -- significance yet, but we will. And it just takes some time for it to play out for each of these underlying situations, probably longer than any of us would hope to -- you'd hope that you could bring some of this stuff to resolution maybe faster than it really takes in real life. But it's really looking at all the data points, the limited sales, the new appraisals that are coming through and then our own analysis for each of the underlying properties. John Pancari : Got it. All right. And then separately, also within commercial real estate, we're getting more and more questions around multifamily exposures and just how well they really are holding up given some supply issues in certain markets. Can you just comment there? Are you seeing any noteworthy stress or any changes to underlying reserve for that book? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Not a lot. I mean you certainly see certain markets that might appear to have some oversupply in condos in certain places. But it feels like that will work itself out over a period of time. We're not seeing real systematic stress in the portfolio at this point. John Pancari : Got it. If I can ask just one last one. On the head count cuts, you mentioned you look at every business pretty much. Are any head count cuts occurring yet in the risk area or anything? Or any changes with the contracts with consultants in the risk overhaul area at all? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. No. Look, the only thing I'd say on the risk and reg work is that we're going to spend whatever we need to spend and put the resources we need against it to get it done. And we're going to continue to do that towards... Charles Scharf : Just to be clear, like we're not cutting head count related to that. In fact, it's probably the opposite when you look over the past bunch of quarters. The only thing which goes up and down is depending on where we are with work with outside consultants, that number will go up or down in a given quarter. But we've also said, if we can use outside resources to help get the work done sooner, we're going to. So as we think about -- just as we think about our efficiencies, that is just not in scope at this point or for the foreseeable future. Operator : The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Erika Najarian : My first question is on the revenue side. As a follow-up to Chubak's line of questioning, I think not only the trading numbers come better this year but also investment banking. And so I hear you loud and clear about the cyclicality of the trading business. But I guess, help us get a sense of if the industry wallet, for example, return to 2019 levels, do you think that you're going to have generally a higher share of revenues in capital markets versus 2019? And sort of the sub-question to that is, as we think about the investments you have already made, what are the other businesses that could potentially surprise us to the upside, where it's not quite optimized yet in terms of its revenue production? And obviously, everybody is thinking about -- you mentioned card, and also everybody is also thinking about wealth management and investment advisory revenues. Charles Scharf : Yes. Well, let me take a shot at that. I think -- listen, I think the answer is, to your question on share, without getting overly specific, yes. We think when you look at where we stand on our growth in our Corporate Investment Banking share, whether it's on the trading side or whether it's on the fee-related side, our shares have grown. And certainly, on the -- within the fee-based side of the business, we do hope they continue to grow. That's driven by the investments that we're making, and investments meaning people in terms of growing our capabilities. And we've got clear goals and targets by person that we bring on in terms of what we expect, and we're going to be tracking to that. And just a reminder, certainly, when we brought some of the people on, they bring some -- a lot of clients with them, some new transactions in the short term. And we've been beneficiaries of that over the last couple of quarters just as we brought some people on. But these are relationship-based businesses, and transactions don't occur every single quarter. So we would expect our share to continue to grow. And I just -- as a reminder, without taking any additional risk overall because we're taking the risk today relative to the exposures that we have. When we look at where we can see growth coming overall across the entire company, we just go business by business. Absolutely, in our consumer small business -- small and business banking segment because -- we've basically been treading water there as we stabilized that business going back to the issues that we had there, which was an incredibly difficult thing to do, and we did. And we've not been our -- we've not been on our front foot in that business. We're going to do it in a very different way than this company did it historically, but there are opportunities to be on the front foot and actually grow share on an organic basis. And so incredibly excited about that opportunity. Not excited, as I said, about growing share in mortgage. That's not where we're after, and it's -- we've talked about where we're going there. Auto, it's about returns, not growth. So don't look for a lot of growth there unless the dynamics change in the business. Mike spoke about card. We're incredibly energized by the evidence that shows with our brand and our relationships. When you put a great product out there, we get positive selection and real growth. And by the way, look at our spend numbers. I mean, if you want to see like the impact of what it means, just look at the spend that we're seeing, which is much higher than the industry levels. Our wealth business, as you pointed out, no question, also treaded water for a long period of time. We're attracting people and teams. We're rolling out new products. So we feel really good about the opportunities that are there. And in the middle market segment, where it's a little bit more business as usual because it is such a strong franchise for us. Even there we look back at our asset-based lending businesses and the things that we acquired from GE. They ran as stand-alone businesses here for a long period of time, and we didn't bring the entire product set of Wells Fargo to those customer bases. Under Kyle Hranicky, Kristin Lesher and MK DuBose or Mary Katherine DuBose are diligently working through that and bringing the Investment Banking product to that entire Commercial Banking product. So I could go on. I just -- it should be broad-based. Most of it, by the way, I'll point out, in terms of when we see opportunities, it is fee-based growth, not because we've dictated that but just because we focused a lot on NII as a company historically. And we just have a lot of opportunities that we get excited about that will play out over a period of time. Erika Najarian : Got it. And I think that excitement is clear, Charlie. And my second question is, given all of that and taking a step back, I totally think it's too early, I agree with you, to give anything on '24 expenses. But more broadly discussing, do you feel like the company is in a little bit of an inflection point? Because on one hand, Mike was saying that very few parts of the bank are optimized. On the other, I think you guys mentioned that the head count is not going the other way, and perhaps it's really some of the outside consulting fees that could go up and down. But I'm wondering if you get asked about expenses in a framework of flat, but then all of this momentum on the revenue side seems to be on the comp. And I'm wondering how you think about as you budget for the company and as you think about just getting to that 15% ROTCE. Let's just put Basel III Endgame aside in terms of the denominator, how do you balance some of the shareholders and the analysts that are asking you about expenses in the context of flat versus the revenue momentum that obviously would need expenses to keep sustaining versus that revenue momentum that you seem to be so excited about? Charles Scharf : Let me start. And Mike, you either come in at the end or just make your comments along the way as well. So I think, first of all, we think about it as 2 separate exercises that we go through. And we're -- and it's very timely because we're in the middle of going through the exercise for next year as most other companies are, which is this company is not efficient, like period, end of story. And I've described this, even with all of the reductions that we've made, it's not surprising because as you peel the onion back, other things present themselves. And so you go in order of things that are more obvious and things like that. But when we sit around as a management team, we feel great about the progress. And there's no clearer way to see that than in the head count numbers, which ultimately drive the expense of the company. And if I -- if we stood here and told you we were going to drive the head count down that much in this period of time, I'm not sure you'd have believed us. And so when we say we're going to do something, we really do mean it. And so when we sit around as a team, there are many more efficiencies to get, and we're diligently working through those. And then separately from that, it's when we talk about making investments in the place, are we getting the payoff for it. And so whether it's the marketing in the card business, where we're spending more money on marketing than we had in the past, and we feel great about, as Mike pointed out, not just the volumes that we're getting but the underlying quality relative to how we had modeled that. And so we'll do that with each and everything. And ultimately, we need to make a decision as we finalize the process of the budget on just much more of a tactical basis of how those things net out. We're well aware of what shareholders are looking for. We're well aware of that the expense side of this company is an important equation in what investors look at us in terms of where -- unlocking value, and we hear it and we see it. And whatever -- wherever we come out when we talk to you about our guidance for next year, we will explain why we got to where we are. It's going to include efficiencies. It's going to include investments. Whether it -- where that turns out, we'll explain it. And I think so far, we've been as clear and as transparent as we can be. And if it makes sense, you'll like it. And if it doesn't, you won't, you'll tell us. But so far, we've been able to have alignment there. But overall, I would just -- it's a long way of saying it's not lost on us that we have opportunities both to reduce expenses and to invest. But making sure that the overall expense level stays in check at this place is incredibly important to us, and we have to prove that there is revenue growth there supporting investments that we make. Operator : The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just Mike, for you, a follow-up on credit on the C&I side, nonaccrual charge-offs staying relatively flat, I guess, as we look through. Just talk to us in terms of when you look at that C&I book, is the impact of the Fed rate hikes felt by your customers? And how are you seeing that evolve? Is your expectation right now -- you talked about the economy being resilient. Are you seeing any soft spots on the C&I book where you're seeing bankruptcies rise within a vertical or a certain segment? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. No. Look, I think, first, you're seeing it come through in utilization of revolvers, right, which are pretty much in check. They aren't moving much and down in some cases. So people are building less inventory given where rates are. They may be making decisions on like how fast they want to invest in their businesses. And so you're seeing that come through in loan growth, which is sensible for -- from their perspective. I think when you look across the portfolio, there are certainly pockets where you may be seeing margin compression still or different idiosyncratic issues. But across the portfolio, the credit quality is still good. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And do you think your customers have felt the hit from higher rates already? Or is that on the comp? Michael Santomassimo : Well, I think they certainly felt it so far, right? I mean most of them have variable rate loan that they service, right? And obviously, the longer rates stay high, they'll maybe feel it more. But certainly, I think they've been impacted. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just one separate quick question on the outlook for buybacks. Clearly, big reset lower. When you -- like your excess capital, you probably have visibility on the worst case on Basel Endgame. It's very rare that banks have excess capital when the stocks are actually near lower. You're creating a tangible book. How do you think about outside of CCAR and SCB in terms of near-term pace of buybacks over the next few quarters relative to what we did this quarter? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. I mean we're not going to get into like trying to give you a view on pacing. We're going to go -- we have a process we go through every quarter to look at all of what's happening. First, it's like how are we going to support clients, what's demand we're seeing, what kind of risks are out there. In the fourth quarter, we have the FDIC special assessment potentially coming. And so there's a whole -- each quarter, there's going to be a whole range of things that we're going to go through, and then we'll decide on pacing. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Mike, can you share with us -- you and your peers as well as investors, we've all been surprised with how this deposit trend of moving money into higher-yielding deposits is going slower than expected. Is there any categories within your deposit base, whether it's just your regular consumer deposits or high net worth deposits or the nonoperational commercial deposits that are moving more slowly? And I know you said you expect it to happen, but is there something that says that it could pick up real quickly in the next 6 months? Or is it just a gradual increase? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. Gerard, I think you really have to pick it apart by the different businesses. I think in the wealth business, it moved quite quickly, right, in terms of seeing deposits decline from where they were and that is now moderated. So it's good to see that, that shifting has sort of slowed down quite substantially in the quarter relative to the last couple of quarters. On the consumer side, the majority of the deposits that we've got sit in accounts with less than $250,000. And so to some degree, these are -- to a large degree, these are operational accounts for folks. And so there's some portion of those funds that are never going to move into other places because people need it in the accounts to live and operate every day. And so I think what's -- so I think we'll see, right? And I think we're all in a bit of uncharted territory at this point with rates being where they are and the pace at which they got there, quantitative tightening happening. And so I think we need to be prepared for it to change. Exactly at what pace and over what period of time, we'll see. But we certainly haven't seen deposit pricing move the way we modeled it a year ago, for sure. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then as a follow-up, since you and Charlie have come on board, Wells has really done a very good job in returning that excess capital. I understand everything that's going on today, and you guys described it in your comments. Can you share with us, is there a buffer -- whenever the final numbers come out, are you guys planning to keep a 100 basis point buffer above that? Or any color there? Michael Santomassimo : Yes. We haven't decided exactly what it'll -- what the buffer will look like after Basel III is implemented. But so far, what we've said a number of times is that 100 basis points is about where we've been targeting. Obviously, we've been running above that for a while. But we'll -- as we get a better view of where these rules are going to shake out, we'll probably talk about that more. But I would think that 100 basis points, at least for now is sort of the bottom end of the range. Operator : And that was our final question for today. I will now turn it over to your speakers for closing remarks. Charles Scharf : All righty. Everyone, thank you very much. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Take care now.

Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results as well as our net interest income and expense expectations for 2024 before we take your questions. Let me start with some 2023 financial highlights. Although, our improved 2023 results benefited from the strong economic environment and higher interest rates, our continued focus on efficiency and strong credit discipline were important contributors as well. We grew net income and diluted earnings per share with higher revenue and lower expenses. Revenue growth was driven by strong growth in net interest income as well as higher noninterest income. Our expenses were down from a year ago, benefiting from lower operating losses as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives. As expected, net charge-offs increased from historical low levels and our allowance for credit losses increased as well. We continue to closely monitor our portfolios, taking credit tightening actions as appropriate. We returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.35 per share in the third quarter, and we repurchased $12 billion of common stock. Average loans increased modestly with growth in the first half of the year, offsetting declines later in the year, reflecting weaker loan demand as well as credit tightening actions. Average deposits were down driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher yielding alternatives. The financial health of our consumers remained strong. While average deposit balances per customer continue to decline from their peak, they remained above pre-pandemic levels as wage growth has more than offset increased spending. Having said that, there are cohorts of customers that are more stressed. Consumer spending remained strong. Credit card spend was up 15% for the year and was remarkably stable throughout the year, with growth rates strong across all categories, except fuel, which was impacted by lower gas prices. Debit card spending was up 1% for the year. Discretionary spend growth slowed from a year ago while non-discretionary spend was stable. Our risk and control work remains our top priority, and I refer you to the comments I made last quarter regarding both our progress in completing the work as well as the risks that remain. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities. And while it is early, and we have more to do, we are starting to see improved growth and increased market share in parts of the company which we believe will drive higher returns over time. Let me provide just a few examples. Our new credit card products have driven an increase in consumer spend at a rate significantly better than the industry average. We've also been investing in the Corporate Investment Bank. CIB revenue grew 26% from a year ago, and our investment banking and trading market shares increased. The positive results in both areas were accomplished while maintaining our existing risk appetite. Additionally, continued execution of our more focused home lending strategy should also produce higher returns and earnings over the next several years. And while our consumer, small and business banking, commercial banking and wealth and investment management business remains strong, opportunities to increase share are significant. Other accomplishments include we launched a new co-branded credit cards with Choice Hotels, building on the new products we've launched over the last couple of years. We continued to enhance our mobile app, which is driving mobile adoption momentum, adding 1.6 million mobile active customers in 2023 and increasing mobile logins 11% from a year ago. Consumers interacted over 20 million times last year with Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant. We exceeded our $150 million commitment to help advance racial equity in home ownership. Our special purpose credit program lowered mortgage rates and reduced financing costs to help thousands of customers. For commercial clients, we continued to invest in order to have the right people and the right capabilities to better penetrate our customer base. We continue to attract experienced bankers to our investment bank, helping us drive growth in priority products and sectors. Throughout 2023, we added new heads and co-heads of equity capital markets, global mergers and acquisitions, financial institutions, financial sponsors, health care and technology, media and telecom. We've also started to see the benefit of the targeted investments we are making in our trading capabilities, including adding talent and improved technology with a focus on supporting our core clients. Finally, we're launching a partnership with Centerbridge, which helps us provide our middle market clients with access to alternative sources of capital, another example of how we're providing solutions for our clients. Investing in our business and introducing new products and services remains a priority in 2024, and Mike will highlight some of the opportunities later on the call. In 2023, we also continued to take a closer look at the businesses that were not in sync with our strategic priorities. As I mentioned, we simplified the home lending business, which included exiting the correspondent business. We are reducing the size of our servicing portfolio as well as optimizing our retail team to align with our narrower customer focus. In the third quarter, we sold private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We also continue to invest in the communities we serve throughout the year, and you can see many examples at the beginning of our slide presentation. As we look forward, our business performance remains sensitive to interest rates and the health of the U.S. economy but we are confident that the actions we are taking will drive stronger results over the cycle. We are closely monitoring credit and while we've seen modest deterioration, it remains consistent with our expectations. Our capital position remains strong and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. Mike will talk more about our expectations for 2024, but I'd like to make a couple of points. First, we have seen and have said that we expect net interest income to decline from the high levels we saw as rates were rising last year. And given that we remain modestly asset-sensitive, the implied Fed rate path reflected in recent forward curves impacts our outlook for NII. Significant uncertainty exists regarding eventual timing and extent of Federal Reserve interest rate actions. Mike will give you our expectations for net interest income, but please recognize that it is based upon a series of market assumptions, which may be right or may be wrong. We hope the overview of our assumptions is helpful. Second, we remain focused on tightly controlling our expenses, but there are several moving pieces, which Mike will walk you through. We will continue to invest what's necessary for our risk and control work. We continue to realize expense efficiencies. And at this point, we are planning to increase our investment spending to create better growth and higher returns in future. Our expected efficiencies roughly offset our planned increase in additional spend at this point. Decisions on how much to invest are dynamic. We closely monitor the outcomes of our investments, and we will adjust our plans based on the success we see. We are focused on our shorter-term results but remain committed to building a well-managed, faster-growing and higher return company over the medium and longer term. I have said and I remain excited about the opportunities to increase our share and returns across all of our businesses. We believe the actions we have taken and continue to take, provide the path to 50% ROTCE. I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their dedication, talent and all they do to move our company forward. I'm excited about Wells Fargo's future and all that we will accomplish in the year ahead. Mike, over to you. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. The first couple of slides summarize how we helped our customers and communities last year, some of which Charlie highlighted, so I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion, or $0.86 per diluted common share. Our fourth quarter results included $1.9 billion or $0.40 per share for the FDIC special assessment, and $1.1 billion of severance expense, including $969 million or $0.20 per share for planned actions. These expenses were partially offset by $621 million or $0.17 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior period tax matters. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 5. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter, 2.5 percentage points above our regulatory minimum plus buffers. This increase was driven by our earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, reflecting lower interest rates and tighter mortgage-backed security spreads. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased $2.4 billion in common stock. We repurchased a total of $12 billion in common stock in 2023, and we currently expect to be able to repurchase more than this amount in 2024. We will continue to consider current market conditions, including interest rate movements, risk-weighted asset levels, stress test results as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters. Turning to credit quality on Slide 7. As expected, net loan charge-offs increased, up 17 basis points from the third quarter to 53 basis points of average loans, driven by commercial real estate office and credit card loans. The increase in commercial net loan charge-offs reflected the higher losses in commercial real estate office, while losses in the rest of our commercial portfolio were stable from the third quarter. As expected, losses started to materialize in our commercial real estate office portfolio as market fundamentals remained weak. The losses were across a number of loans spread across various markets and were driven by borrower performance, lower appraisals were the result of properties or loans being sold at a loss. We substantially built reserves for this portfolio throughout 2023 as criticized and nonperforming assets increased. And while we expect additional losses in the coming quarters given the market fundamentals, and capital markets and liquidity challenges in this sector, the amounts will likely going to be uneven and episodic. Our commercial real estate team has a rigorous monitoring process and continues to derisk and reduce exposure, and we're using this information to evaluate our allowance, which I will discuss later. Consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up $118 million from the third quarter to 79 basis points of average loans. The increase was driven by the credit card portfolio, which performed as expected with increased losses driven by recent vintages maturing. Nonperforming assets increased 3% from the third quarter as growth in commercial nonaccrual loans more than offset declines in consumer. The increase in commercial real estate non-accrual loans was driven by a $567 million increase in office non-accrual loans. Moving to Slide 8. Our allowance for credit losses increased slightly in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase for credit card and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. The table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. While the charge offs we took in the fourth quarter were contemplated in our allowance, we are still early in the cycle and after going through our quarterly review process, the coverage ratio in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio remained relatively stable at 11%. On Slide 9, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both the third quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continued to grow, while most other categories declined. I\u2019ll highlight specific drivers when discussing our Operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 122 basis points from a year ago and 12 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 3% from a year ago as growth in corporate and investment banking was more than offset by declines in our other deposit gathering businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher yielding alternatives. Period end deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up $4.2 billion from the third quarter as declines in consumer banking and lending were offset by slightly higher deposits in wealth and investment management for the first time in over a year, as well as higher commercial deposits, which included our efforts to attract clients operational deposits. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase up 22 basis points from the third quarter to 158 basis points with higher deposit costs across all Operating segments. The pace of the increase was similar to the third quarter. Our mix of deposits continued to shift with our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits declining to 27%. Turning to net interest income on Slide 10. Fourth quarter net interest income declined $662 million or 5% from a year ago due to lower deposit loan balances partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. I\u2019ll provide details on our 2024 net interest income expectations later on the call. Turning to expenses on Slide 11. While our fourth quarter non-interest expense included the FDIC special assessment and $1.1 billion of severance expense, including $969 million for planned actions, expenses declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses. While most of the planned actions should result in lower headcount, some of the actions are related to our workforce location strategy, which should lower occupancy costs and provide other benefits, but may not always reduce headcount. Total expenses increased from the third quarter, driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher severance expense. Personnel expense increased $554 million from the third quarter as higher severance expense was partially offset by lower benefits and incentive compensation expense, including certain year-end adjustments, as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower headcount. Turning to our Operating segment, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 12. Consumer, small and business banking revenue increased 1% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income, reflecting higher interest rates partially offset by lower deposit balances. We\u2019ve been focusing on controlling expenses and lowering the cost to serve our customers, which includes driving digital adoption, simplifying our product portfolio and using technology to automate our operating environment. As our customers continue to shift to lower cost channels, resulting in fewer teller transactions and handled call volumes, we\u2019ve reduced our total number of branches by over 280 or 6% from a year ago. At the same time, we have been refurbishing our branches as part of an accelerated multiyear effort to transform and refresh our full branch network. I\u2019ll highlight other ways we are investing to improve the customer experience later on the call. Home lending revenue increased 7% from a year ago. Lower gain on sale margins and originations, as well as lower loan balances were more than offset by improved valuations on loans held for sale due to losses in the fourth quarter of 2022. We continued to reduce headcount home lending in the fourth quarter, down 36% from a year ago, reflecting market conditions as well as our new strategy. Credit card revenue declined 1% from a year ago, driven by the impact of introductory promotional rates and higher rewards expense, partially offset by higher loan balances and interchange revenue. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth continued to be strong, up 17% from a year ago. Auto revenue declined 19% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression and personal lending revenue was up 13% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 13. Mortgage originations declined 69% from a year ago and 30% from the third quarter, reflecting the progress we made on our strategic objectives for this business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. As we executed on our strategic objectives, we\u2019ve also made significant progress on reducing the amount of third-party loans serviced, down 18% from a year ago. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for seven consecutive quarters and balances were down 11% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 34% year-over-year, reflecting credit tightening actions. Debit card spend increased 2% from a year ago, with both discretionary and non-discretionary spend up 2%, with growth in most categories except for home improvement, fuel and travel. Credit card spending continued to be strong was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew with double digit growth rates in every category except fuel, home improvement and apartment apparel. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 14. Middle market banking revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit related fees, reflecting lower earnings credit rates. Asset based lending and leasing revenue increased 9% year-over-year due to the impact of higher interest rates and improved results on equity investments. Average loan balances were up 2% from a year ago, driven by growth in asset based lending and leasing. Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 15. Banking revenue increased 15% from a year ago, driven by higher lending revenue, higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products, and stronger treasury management results. As Charlie highlighted, we\u2019ve successfully hired experienced bankers, which is helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well for when markets improve. Commercial real estate revenue grew 2% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets revenue increased 33% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue and structured products, equities, credit products and commodities. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago with growth in markets more than offset by declines in banking and commercial real estate. On Slide 16, wealth and investment management revenue declined 1% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower net interest income driven by lower deposit balances as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives. The decline in net interest income from a year ago was partially offset by higher asset based fees due to increased market valuations. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth quarter results reflected market valuations as of October 1, which were higher from a year ago, asset based fees in the first quarter will reflect valuations as of January 1, which were also higher from a year ago. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, driven by decline in securities based lending. Slide 17 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined $345 million from a year ago, reflecting higher deposit crediting rates paid to the Operating segments. This decline was partially offset by improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments. Turning to our expectations for 2024 starting on Slide 18. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income. As we look forward there are a number of factors that could impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior and competitive behavior to name just a few, all of which we have little to no control over. This makes it particularly difficult to estimate net interest income for 2024. There is more uncertainty than usual given the market\u2019s strong view of rate cut timing in the quantum. Looking at our results, while we had strong growth in full year net interest income in 2023 versus 2022, our net interest income came down modestly each quarter last year, driven by the higher deposit pricing and mixed changes. You can see this impact when you analyze our fourth quarter net interest income, which was down approximately 3% from our full year 2023, net interest income of $52.4 billion. Our current expectation is that full year 2024 net interest income could potentially be approximately 7% to 9% lower than our full year 2023. This expectation is anchored on the forward rate curve and a series of business assumptions including; lower rates in the recent forward rate curve, which given our modestly asset sensitive position would be a headwind to net interest income, a slight decline in average loans for the full year, which includes modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year, reinvestment of lower yielding securities runoff into higher yielding assets, which would also modestly extend the duration of the investment portfolio, further attrition in consumer banking and lending deposits, as well as continued mix shift from lower yielding products to higher yielding, deposits in our other deposit gathering businesses are expected to be relatively stable and market funding will replace the decline in consumer deposits as needed. We currently expect that net interest income will trough towards the end of this year. As we\u2019ve done in prior years, we are also assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2024 will depend on a variety of factors, which many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and pricing and loan demand. Turning to our 2024 expense expectations on Slide 19. We started our focus on efficiency initiatives three years ago and we\u2019ve successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately $10 billion of gross expense saves. Through our efficiency initiatives we have reduced headcount every quarter since third quarter of 2020 and headcount is down 16% since the end of 2020. Looking at our expectations for this year and following the waterfall on the slide from left to right. We reported $55.6 billion of non-interest expense in 2023, which included the $1.9 billion FDIC special assessment. Excluding this item, expenses would have been $53.6 billion, which we believe is a good starting point for discussion of 2024 expenses. Looking at the next bar, we expect severance expense to be approximately $1.3 billion lower, driven by the $969 million expense we took in the fourth quarter for planned actions, we expect expenses to increase by at least $300 million due to higher revenue related expense, driven by wealth and investment management, revenue related expenses will ultimately be a function of activity and market levels, and therefore could be higher or lower than this estimate. At this point, we expect all other expenses to be flat, though there are significant efficiencies and increased investments included in this expectation. We expect approximately $2.7 billion of gross expense reductions in 2024 due to the efficiency initiatives. We highlight in the slide some of the areas where we anticipate additional savings and continue to believe we have more opportunities beyond 2024. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives and we will continue to make significant investments in our risk and control infrastructure. While we remain focused on executing on our efficiency initiatives, we\u2019re also continuing to invest and we expect approximately $1.1 billion of incremental technology and equipment expense, reflecting higher costs related to the amortization of investment in prior years, as well as new investments planned for 2024. We also expect merit increases of approximately $700 million, which are primarily awarded to employees with lower salaries. We highlight some of the other areas where we plan to invest on the next slide. Our 2024 expense outlook includes ongoing business related operating losses of approximately $1.3 billion, similar to the level we had in 2023. As previously disclosed, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses. So putting this all together, we expect 2024 non-insurance expense to be approximately $52.6 billion. It\u2019s important to note that while we\u2019ve made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, as Charlie highlighted, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. Given how critical it is to continue to invest in our business. On Slide 20, we provide some examples of our areas of focus for 2024 let me highlight a few. Building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the technology investments we\u2019ve already made to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers, and we plan to continue investing these areas this year throughout our businesses. We are planning to hire more bankers and advisors to grow our Wells Fargo Premier Offering to our affluent clients. We plan to launch a new travel oriented credit card as part of our autograph suite of products, as well as a new small business credit card this year. To better serve our commercial clients, we plan to continue higher within investment banking and commercial banking to support priority sectors and products to help drive growth. Now, let me conclude with Slide 21, where we will discuss return on tangible common equity. When we first discussed our path to improving returns on the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, we had an 8% ROTCE. Since then, we have taken multiple actions to improve our returns, including executing on our efficiency initiatives, investing in our businesses to help drive growth and returning excess capital to shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend $0.10 to $0.35 per share and repurchasing $32 billion of common stock. These actions help to improve our ROTCE, our reported ROTCE in the fourth quarter was 9%, but as we highlight in the table, our ROTCE was impacted by a number of notable items. Our 2023 returns also reflected the benefit of rising rates, which helped to drive strong net interest income growth, and as I\u2019ve already highlighted, we expect net interest income to decline this year. We still believe, we have an achievable path to a sustainable 15% ROTCE over the medium term as we continue to make progress on transforming the company. There are several key factors that support our belief. Our ability to return excess capital, we currently have a significant amount of excess capital, 2.5 percentage points above our regulatory minimum buffers for CET1 and as I already highlighted, we expect to increase our share repurchases this year. I highlighted the progress we\u2019ve already made to reposition our Home Lending business, including reducing the amount of third party mortgage loans serviced by 18% from a year ago. As we continue to streamline this business, we expect the profitability to improve. We\u2019ve grown our Credit Card business with balances up 40% since the end of 2021 and new accounts 25% higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. However, the current profitability of this business has been impacted by acquisition costs and allowance build, and we expect profitability to improve as the portfolio matures. Finally, we\u2019ve made significant investments the last few years across our franchise to better serve our customers, and help drive growth. We expect the revenue growth that these investments should generate in businesses like Corporate Investment Banking and Wealth And Investment Management will help fund additional investments. So, we have many drivers to close the gap and improve returns. In summary, our results in 2023 demonstrated our commitment to improving our financial performance. We grew revenue, reduced expenses, increased capital returns to shareholders and maintained our strong capital position. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question of the day will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Happy New Year. Mike, I was appreciate all the NII detail. Just given all the different puts and takes that you cited, I was hoping you could provide some context as to how you\u2019re thinking about the exit rate for NII in 2024 per the guidance, just given expectations per the street that NII should inflect positively in 2025. Just want to get a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about where NII could potentially trough or stabilize based on the forward curve? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, no, I appreciate the question. When you \u2013 based on what we gave you, Steve, I think, we said on the page and in my remarks that we do expect it to start to inflect and trough as we get towards the end of the year. Exactly when that happens, I think we\u2019ll sort of see. We\u2019re not going to get too specific there, but we do expect that you would start to see a trough as we get to the end of the year and into 2025. Steven Chubak : Very helpful. And then for my follow up just on expenses, the core expense guidance shows another net reduction in 2024. You noted that you\u2019re making investments, but those will be offset by efficiency savings. And just want to get a sense as to how long you can sustain that flattish core expense trajectory, continue to fund investments with future efficiencies. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, I think when we think about the efficiency journey that we\u2019re on. I think Charlie and I have been both pretty clear consistently now that there\u2019s more to do and 2024 is just another year in the journey. Right. And we\u2019ve got more to do post that to continue to drive efficiency across the place, where we\u2019re going to net out on a year-to-year basis in terms of the net spend, I\u2019m not going to try to predict. But as you look across the company, I think we\u2019re just continuing to methodically make progress to drive automation, efficiency, reduce third party spend, reduce our real estate footprint across all of the different dimensions. And I think we think we\u2019ve got more to do and that\u2019ll continue into 2025 and beyond. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : The next question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Mike, I wanted to ask about the fee income drivers for this year. Charlie mentioned obviously some examples of progress that you\u2019ve gotten leverage on investments and then obviously you\u2019ve got cyclical headwinds and tailwinds. So maybe just could you walk through some of the bigger fee income drivers and give your sense of puts and takes and how you\u2019re feeling this year going into the fee revenue outlook? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, sure. Thanks, John. When you look at the components there, I mean, the largest one is going to be our advisory fees in the Wealth and Investment Management business. And market levels are higher than they were this time last year. And so if that holds or gets better, as many people predicting, that should be constructive for that fee. When you start looking at the other line items like trading, the market\u2019s got to cooperate. We\u2019re happy with the progress we\u2019ve been making across the different businesses there, but the market is going to have to cooperate as well for that to continue. We had a number of impairments across our venture capital portfolio this year. At some point, that should start to peter out, and we\u2019ll see that inflect. And then the other fee lines should be pretty predictable for the most part, as you sort of look forward. John McDonald : Okay. And just to follow up on the net interest income idea of bottoming towards the end of the year, theoretically, what would be the drivers of that kind of bottoming? Do you have fixed asset reprice that helps? Or is it kind of assumed new asset generation? Maybe you could just wrap that into some thoughts about what would drive that inflection in the context of any update on rate sensitivity as well? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, sure. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the latter part first. And \u2013 as you can see in the data we gave in the presentation, we\u2019re anchoring it to what was in the forward curve as of a day last week, which is not that dissimilar to what you have today. And I think when you look at sensitivity to that, our interest rate sensitivity disclosures in this case are a pretty good estimate for how to think about whether if rates are a little bit higher or a little bit lower than what\u2019s in that forward curve. And if you look at where we were at the end of the third quarter, we were still modestly asset sensitive. That\u2019ll still be the case at the end of the fourth quarter. It will come down a little bit from where it was, but will still be asset sensitive. But its \u2013 and if you look at the forward curve, I think on average, rates are coming down something like 50 basis points. And so it is pretty linear math when you look at the sensitivities that we included in the queue, when you look at the underlying assumptions as you go into the year, we\u2019ve got loan growth being pretty muted in the beginning part of the year. That\u2019ll hopefully start to pick up as we get later in the year. So that will be a driver of it. As you get towards the end of the year, you\u2019ll have some stabilization. We\u2019re expecting stabilization of pretty stable deposits across the commercial and wealth management businesses. At some point, the consumer deposits will also stabilize and the mix will stabilize as well. You\u2019ve got continued asset repricing that happens in there as well. So it\u2019s a little bit of all of it that brings you to the point at, which it starts to trough and inflect. But again, exactly when that\u2019s going to happen, we\u2019ll sort of leave, we\u2019ll leave till later in the year, but we do expect that\u2019ll happen as we get closer to the end of the year. John McDonald : Understood. Thanks. Operator : The next question will come from Ken Houston of Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Houston : Hi, thanks. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m going to stay on theme, but just as you start to the beginning of the year and deposit price continues to flow through and the mix continues to change. As far as the DDAs, I\u2019m wondering if you could just help us understand, how do you expect that trajectory? DDAs definitely still out flowing, which is expected, but in terms of mix and then just how you expect the deposit rate of change or the downside beta to act through the cycle. Can you help us understand that, Mike? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Sure. When you look at what\u2019s happening just on deposits, the trend that we\u2019ve been seeing now on the mix shift has been pretty consistent for the last two or three quarters at least. And so \u2013 so at some point that\u2019ll moderate more, but it\u2019s been pretty consistent. And so that\u2019s probably a decent assumption as you sort of go into the first part of the year at least. When you start looking at deposit pricing can later in the year, as rates start to move. On the commercial side, rates and betas have been competitive now and pretty high for a while, and they\u2019ll be just as rate sensitive on the way back down. That\u2019s part of the bargain on the commercial side is, you get good competitive betas on the way up and you also get them on the way down. On the consumer side, there\u2019s been less movement on standard pricing across many of the products, but you\u2019ve had the introduction of CDs and promo rates and all that stuff will start to move down pretty quickly as the expectation for rates do as well. Ken Houston : Okay. So, if I think about that, then would you imply that the first quarter starting point, we see a little bit more of an NII step down and then as you get to that hopeful stabilization in the back half, like just because of how that moves? Mike Santomassimo : Well. I think based on what we gave you, right? So we are expecting a full year NII to be down 7% to 9% hopefully. And if it starts to stabilize as you get to the end of the year, then that implies a step down in the beginning of the year. Exactly, we\u2019re not going to give you a number by quarter, but I \u2013 you would \u2013 you should expect to step down as you go in the beginning part of the year. Ken Houston : Right. Okay. I understand. Okay. Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Scott Siefers : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you might be able to spend just another moment on the longer-term cost opportunity. I guess, I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s a point where some of the investment spending pressures ease and there might still be an opportunity for costs to decline more visibly on an underlying basis or by contrast, is this level of investment spending, is that something that\u2019ll just be sort of pretty consistent year in and year out? Charlie Scharf : Yes, Scott, it really is going to depend. I will highlight one thing though. In the slide that we have there, we \u2013 I noted that part of what\u2019s driving the investment spend this year is the tech and equipment line moving up. And so that won\u2019t continue to move up at that pace forever. And so that does start to moderate as you go out into the future. But as you look at the other investments we\u2019re making, we\u2019re going to try to be very thoughtful about looking at the opportunities that we have across each of the businesses, thinking about short, medium, long-term results and making sure that we\u2019re sort of calibrating all that, right? But I would expect us to continue to make investments in each of the businesses. And I think that ultimately that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive great returns and better performance over time. Scott Siefers : Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe just a question on credit. You all have been very proactive in dealing with sort of the office CRE situation. Just curious to hear how your, what your thoughts are on how this cycle, that asset class sort of plays out from here. Does it just remain a long slog? Or is there perhaps a point where your conservatism has sort of gotten ahead of issues and you might actually be able to relieve a bit of that really healthy double-digit reserve? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Look, as we look at the reserve, and then I\u2019ll come back to the broader point there, at some point we\u2019ll start using the reserve more fully and then that allowance coverage ratio will come down. No doubt. I mean, that\u2019s the way it should work when you think about CECL and the way the accounting should work. I think, in terms of your broader point, it\u2019s a long movie. We\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re past the opening credits, but we\u2019re still in the beginning of the movie. And so it\u2019s going to take some time for this to play out. And as I noted, it\u2019ll be somewhat of an uneven and episodic sort of nature to the charge offs and as you work through this, because every property has a different timeline in terms of events that it needs to sort of work through. So I do think that we\u2019ve got a while for this to play out through the system. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess maybe just to the \u2013 thanks for all the details on NII expenses and the ROTCE. I guess if you had to [ph] and it\u2019s not lost upon anyone with regards to the investments you\u2019ve made in the franchise. But when you look at the slide, fourth quarter 2020 ROTCE 8%, three years fast forward, it\u2019s gone from 8% to 9%. Assuming there\u2019s no real perfect world to operate a bank, from a shareholder perspective, quickly, do you think we can get from 9% to 15%? You\u2019ve given us the moving pieces. But I\u2019m just wondering maybe Charlie, Mike, how do you think about, is it a two-year slog? Is it longer than that? Love some perspective there. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And I think maybe I\u2019ll start and Charlie can chime in. So I think when you look at that page, Ebrahim, I think you really have to look at the impact of the special assessment that in the results, right? And so that\u2019s four percentage points of ROTCE, so think of the underlying operating performance from a returns perspective, more closer to that 13% range. And so there has been quite a bit of progress since Q4 2020. And then as you sort of look forward, we highlighted some of the key drivers on the right. And in my commentary, look, we\u2019ve got a lot of excess capital despite whatever happens with Basel III. And so we\u2019ve got room to continue to return that to shareholders. We are in the middle of repositioning and the home lending business, which will drive not only good, better returns in that business, but improvement across the franchise. We\u2019ve got the card business, which we\u2019re seeing very good performance in as we\u2019ve launched our new products over the last couple years. And as that matures, we will be meaningful contributor. And then we\u2019ve got continue to get the benefit of all the other investments that we\u2019re making. And so we feel like we\u2019ve made a lot of good progress since the 2020. And then we\u2019ve got really clear plans to continue to see better performance. Charlie Scharf : And I\u2019ll just add a little bit to it and to be a little bit repetitive. When you look at that slide, again, those are reported numbers. And so, the way we think about it is the earnings power of the company today on an ROTCE basis, you got to make your own assumptions for what\u2019s in and out and what normalized net interest income is because we\u2019ve been clear that we\u2019ve been over earning. But when you look at, when you add back these expenses like FDIC, which relate to the past and this quarter and aren\u2019t going to go forward. Our ROTCE is up 50% from where it was. So that is significant change. On top of that, when we look at the actions, as Mike said, that we\u2019ve taken in the home lending business, when we see the trajectory of growth that we\u2019re seeing in the card business, just as those things mature, let alone being able to deploy the excess capital we have, those are things that are in process. We don\u2019t have to really do anything more other than let them mature and let them play out that is continued movement towards the 15% ROTCE. And then the last thing I\u2019d say is just away from those things. When we got here, these businesses were not on trajectories to grow. The card business wasn\u2019t growing, the corporate investment bank wasn\u2019t growing. You can go through them one by one. And so, as we\u2019ve talked about making investments, offsetting some of these efficiencies that we\u2019ve seen and making determinations on whether or not they\u2019re paying off. Those things that we\u2019re seeing these increases in share, we\u2019re pretty confident that they are going to continue to drive improved results over time. And so, as I said in my remarks, we\u2019re clearly susceptible to market environment both for interest rates and the overall economic environment in the shorter term, but we feel both really good about the progress that we\u2019ve made. We feel really good about what the path we see going forward is recognizing that there\u2019s still a lot more that we have to do. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. That was thorough. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up, Mike, on CRE. I\u2019m assuming you had some assets moved through the \u2013 off the balance sheet. I\u2019m just wondering, do \u2013 today, relative to a year ago, do you have better visibility on where the clearing prices for some of these non-performing CRE or challenge CRE loans? And are you seeing any pressure spreading beyond CRE offers to other parts of the portfolio in any meaningful way? Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Yes. I mean, look, as time goes by, we\u2019ve got \u2013 we get better and better information around where things are going to play out. But it is still somewhat specific to the asset. And so I wouldn\u2019t try to generalize yet until we see more transactions and more data points. When you look at the broader CRE market at least in our portfolio, we are not seeing the stress spread to other parts of it. Ebrahim Poonawala : Helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. My first question is a follow-up to Ebrahim line of questioning on ROTCE. Charlie, Mike\u2019s right, obviously, you have plenty of excess capital. As we think about your outlook for not much loan growth in 2024, and obviously there\u2019s the asset cap still in place. How should we think about what you\u2019re looking for as Guidepost to potentially accelerate that buyback from the $2.4 billion level? Is it as far out as the Basel III endgame finalization, or would you wait for more clarity near term on the DFAST results in June? Mike Santomassimo : It\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll take a shot at that Erika. And when you look at the \u2013 when you look at our full year numbers, we \u2013 I tried to highlight in my comments that we do expect that our repurchases will be higher than what we did in 2023, the exact timing and pace, I\u2019m not going to get into, but and then we\u2019ll look at all of as we do every quarter, we look at all of the different risks that could be out there including, thinking about where CCAR or the stress tests will come out. And from a Basel III perspective, we are in really good shape as we said last quarter. We\u2019re already above where we need to be from a, if it was fully implemented as is, and we\u2019re hopeful that that won\u2019t be the case. And so, and we\u2019re going to generate more capital as we go through the year. And so we\u2019ve got as I said, we\u2019ve got plenty of excess capital. We plan to buy back more stock than we did in 2023 and we\u2019ll leave the exact timing and pace to future calls. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And Mike, my follow-up question is another one on NII, I did notice that your short-term borrowings went up a lot in 2023. And just looking at the asset side, it seemed like it was funding that increase in liquidity to $204 billion [ph] cash in cash at the Fed at period end. And I\u2019m wondering, as we\u2019re thinking about your liability mix in 2024, and then I think your average balance sheet size was 1.91 trillion at the end of the year. I\u2019m just wondering if we should expect the balance sheet to shrink because you don\u2019t, you may not need all those short-term borrowings, or is there a reason why you feel like you want to hold that much liquidity at the Fed at this time? Mike Santomassimo : Well, it is certainly possible, the balance sheet will get smaller throughout the year. I think that\u2019ll just be a function of what we ultimately see on loan growth. How much we end up deploying into securities as we go through the year and where it makes sense. We will let the balance sheet just ebb and flow back down. And I think that\u2019s the way we\u2019re sort of thinking about it now. And I think at this point, there\u2019s not a lot of cost to leaving at the Fed given where the \u2013 where IORB is. And so that\u2019ll change as rates start to come down and we\u2019ll calibrate the overall size based on what we think the opportunity is. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir. John Pancari : Good morning. On the NII outlook of down 7% to 9%, can you maybe help us think about the expected net interest margin trajectory through the year? How we should think about that in the context of what you\u2019re expecting in terms of earning asset yields and dynamic on funding costs? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Well, we don\u2019t \u2013 we\u2019re not going to try to predict exactly where the NIM is going to go quarter by quarter. But I think as you would guess, right, assuming the balance sheets that are a relatively stable size as NII starts to come down, the NIM will compress, right? And there\u2019ll be tailwinds and headwinds related, as the assets as the securities portfolio reprices, that\u2019ll be a tailwind. As you start to see variable rate loans come down, as rates come down, that\u2019ll be a headwind. And so, I think most of it should be relatively simple to kind of estimate as you sort of plug the assumptions into your model, but there\u2019s no sort of magic to it. But you would expect NIM to continue to come down as the balance sheet stays stable and NII comes down. John Pancari : Okay. All right, thanks. And then separately on commercial real estate, and can you maybe give us a little more color in terms of where you saw the stress, what types of office properties and what type of marks to the underlying assets are you seeing as you\u2019re reappraising the properties? And I guess maybe just talk about the level of confidence you have in the updated 7.9% office reserve at this level. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And really the allowance I would, allowance coverage ratio I would pay attention to on the slide is our CIB, CRE office portfolio, which is close to 11%. And that\u2019s really the institutional style office buildings where really the stress is coming through. When you look at the charge-offs, it was across a number of properties. It wasn\u2019t one or two. It was pretty geographically dispersed across different cities and across different parts of the country, so there wasn\u2019t an over concentration anywhere. Each of the properties have very specific situations, and so there was a pretty wide range in terms of where the price cleared or where the appraisal came in. A good chunk of these properties are being marked, because we\u2019ve got new appraisals for various reasons. A small amount of it was actually realized, because the note or the property was sold. And so for a good amount of it, we\u2019ll see how it ultimately plays out. There could be recoveries as we go. But it was a pretty, as you would expect, it was a substantial decline in what people thought the value of the properties was just a year or two ago. John Pancari : Okay, got it. Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Charlie. Mike on the guide for the net interest income on the forward curve. If the forward curve is incorrect and we\u2019re sitting here a year from now, and rather than seeing a 415 or 416 [ph] Fed funds rate, if it\u2019s close to the 5% or 490, how much of a positive would that be for a higher net interest income for you guys? Have you guys, I\u2019m assuming, use different sensitivity analysis to kind of give yourself a sense of where net interest income could go under different rate scenarios. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, I would, and just like I think John at McDonald asked it earlier, I would look at our interest rate sensitivity, Gerard, and as I said, we\u2019re still modestly asset sensitive. A little bit less at the end of the fourth quarter than the third quarter. And I think it is a pretty linear sort of equation there. And so I would just look at the 100 basis point move that we have in there. It\u2019s around a couple of billion dollars of move when you look at that as of the end of the third quarter, again, it\u2019ll come in slightly from that likely into \u2013 at the end of the fourth quarter and just use whatever assumption you want, and it is a pretty linear. Within reason, it\u2019s a pretty linear equation. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then you guys obviously have been very focused on the expense reduction and aberrantable job since you guys all got there obviously. Is there any way that you could bring down the operating losses? I think they\u2019ve been pretty consistent at $1.3 billion for a bit. Is there anything in there that down the road you could change where it would actually fall? Or is it just something that just the cost of doing business with fraud, theft and et cetera? Mike Santomassimo : Well, there\u2019s certainly some portion of that, that will is just the cost of doing business. Now, even on the fraud and BAU operating losses, we, as most people, I would think, are continuing to invest in capabilities to reduce those more and more and that\u2019s we continue to do that as well. And then I think as we continue to put more of the issues, historical issues behind us, hopefully the overall number continues to trend downward. Gerard Cassidy : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Any thoughts on where card charge-offs go in 2024? I think you\u2019re about 4% this quarter. And I guess you\u2019ve had really good growth. So if we lag it like we used to do in the old days, maybe we get about 4.5%. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good starting point or just any way to frame losses from here. Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, I won\u2019t give you a specific number, but the way you\u2019re thinking about it is exactly right. I think as you look at the portfolio that we have, which might be a little different than others is, we launched the new product set starting a little over two years ago, but you\u2019ve sort of seen more meaningful new account growth starting about two years ago. And so you\u2019re in that normal maturation curve and seasoning of sort of losses as they come on. And so we would expect that it would continue to trend a little bit higher from where it is. Matt O\u2019Connor: And then, we\u2019re seeing this obviously not just with you guys, but kind of across the board in terms of card losses go up, even though we\u2019re still in this really good environment in terms of employment and wealth and still a bit of excess savings. Just thoughts on what\u2019s driving losses. Again, not just for you, but just for everybody, there\u2019s life events that always happen, but it just feels like maybe card losses are getting a little higher than I would have thought with unemployment where it is, and again, like jobs available and all those dynamics. Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, and maybe I\u2019ll start. And I think as Charlie kind of highlighted in his script, the averages all look fine when you look at liquidity or deposit balances. And certainly even when you look at the cumulative wage growth that you\u2019ve seen over the last few years, in aggregate, you go, it paints a pretty good picture. But when you go below that, and we\u2019ve tried to highlight this a few times over the last year or so, when you go below that, there are certainly cohorts of clients or people that are stressed. And the further you go down in income levels or the further you go down in wealth levels, the cumulative impact of inflation has really taken a toll. And so you\u2019re going to have some percentage of people that are feeling much more stressed than what the aggregate numbers would imply. And in some cases, their liquidity is going to be lower than it was pre-COVID. In some cases, they\u2019ve been having to build bigger credit card balances. And so for us, it\u2019s not a big part of the overall portfolio, but you\u2019re going to continue to see that, which is something we should all have expected and expect to see as you go forward. Charlie Scharf : And the only thing I would add is that that\u2019s something that has always existed pre-COVID. Right. There were always people that were doing better and there were people that were doing worse. And I think what\u2019s important, I speak for ourselves, when we look at our card losses, what we actually are looking at is, how they\u2019re performing on a vintage basis versus pre-COVID levels. And the curves are right on top of what that is. And so it\u2019s when we talk about getting back to normal in terms of what we\u2019re seeing, that\u2019s what we\u2019re actually seeing in card losses. We\u2019re not seeing at this point anything that goes beyond that. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just lastly, if I can squeeze in, remind me, like the targeted customer, I think it\u2019s like prime plus. But any way to frame that in terms of whether it\u2019s Spico [ph] or wealth metric or homeowner percent or any way just to frame it, it is becoming a bigger part of the company, obviously so. Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, look, we\u2019re not going to get that specific, but when you look at like, individual products, they\u2019re targeted towards different cohorts of clients. But what I would say overall, we feel really good about the credit quality of the new accounts we\u2019re putting on. And in most cases, in most products, the credit profile is better than what we have from the historical backbook. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, thanks for all the color. Operator : The next question will come from Dave Rochester of Compass Point Research. Your line is open. Dave Rochester : Hey, good morning, guys. Sorry for one more question on the NII guide here, but was just curious how much of that decline that you\u2019re expecting for this year is driven by that continued remix of deposits and the lower non-interest bearing deposits you talked about and where are you assuming that DDA mix settles out this year? Charlie Scharf : Yes, as you would guess, when you lose non-interest bearing deposits or they shift into higher yielding products, that\u2019s going to have a pretty substantial impact. And so, that is a big driver of what the decline is for the rest of the year. We haven\u2019t really talked about exactly where it bottoms, but it should stabilize at some point. Dave Rochester : Okay. And then on capital, was curious what more buybacks means for capital ratios and that 2.5% buffer you talked about by the end of 2024. All else equal is the thought that you\u2019ll take those ratios and that buffer lower this year. Charlie Scharf : We\u2019ll see, but I think, I won\u2019t try to give you a buyback number. Lots of things go into figuring that out throughout the year. But as we said, we expect buybacks to be bigger than last year and, the level assuming that nothing significant happens in the macro environment, the level that we\u2019re at is higher than we need to be. Dave Rochester : Great, thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : And our last question will come from Manan Gosalia of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Manan Gosalia : Hey, good morning. Two quick ones for me. I know you said your guide includes stable deposits, but a shift towards interest bearing deposits. Would an end to QT stop that share shift, or is it different, given you\u2019re seeing that share shift from the consumer side? Charlie Scharf : Yes, what we said is, we expect stable deposits on the wealth and the commercial side. We do expect some declines on the consumer side, and an end to QT would be a positive. Manan Gosalia : And can you expand on that a little bit? Why would that be? Charlie Scharf : Well, QT at drains, will at some point more meaningfully drain liquidity out of the banking system. Right. So once you get the RRP facility down to a smaller number, which is likely to happen, then any further QT starts to really remove liquidity more directly out of the banking system and so that stops. That\u2019s a positive for deposits. Manan Gosalia : Got it. Okay. And then just on credit, how do falling rates impact your outlook for CRE losses at the margin? Do you feel better about working with borrowers and mitigating losses and NPLs and how long this takes to work out, or have things not changed that meaningfully yet? Charlie Scharf : Hasn\u2019t changed that meaningful yet. Really. We\u2019re dealing with what is a structural change in sort of demand for real estate in some parts of the country. And so you got to work through that. And then I think on the margin, lower rates are helpful, but the bigger issue needs to get worked through first. Manan Gosalia : Great. Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Okay, thanks, everyone, for the questions \u2013 next time. Operator : Thank you all for your participation on today\u2019s conference call.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf, and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financials referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some first quarter highlights. Our solid results reflect the progress we're making to improve and diversify our financial performance and the continued strength in the US economy. It's gratifying to see the investments we're making across the franchise contributing to higher revenue versus the fourth quarter as an increase in non-interest income more than offset the expected decline in net interest income. Non-interest income also benefited from higher equity markets, which benefited our wealth and investment management business. Net charge offs were higher than a year ago, as expected, and stable from the fourth quarter. Credit trends remain generally consistent, consumer delinquencies continue to perform as we\u2019ve forecasted and year-over-year growth in consumer spend remains consistent with prior quarters. In our commercial portfolios, the weakness we see continues to be in certain commercial office properties, but our expectations have not significantly changed versus what we anticipated last quarter. Mike will discuss the specific items that drove an increase in expenses from a year ago, but we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives, including reducing headcount, which has declined every quarter since the third quarter of 2020. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the fourth quarter as higher rates are impacting demand and we are continuing to reduce our exposure in certain portfolios. Average deposits were relatively stable from the fourth quarter as growth in interest bearing deposits offset lower non-interest-bearing deposits. Our capital position remains strong and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. As we stated on our last earnings call, we expect to repurchase more common stock this year than we did in 2023. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of $6.1 billion in common stock and our average common shares outstanding declined 6% from a year ago. Now, let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work. Earlier this year, the OCC terminated a consent order issued in 2016 regarding sales practices misconduct. The closure of this order was an important milestone as it is confirmation that we operate much differently today around sales practices. As I repeatedly said, our risk and control work remains our top priority and closing consent orders is an important sign of progress. This is the sixth consent order that our regulators have terminated since I joined Wells Fargo in 2019. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous, ongoing effort. And as we implement changes, we track effectiveness along the way. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment and we see that we are completing interim deliverables, but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete, so it will remain our top priority and our approach will not change. As I highlighted in my recent annual letter, we have added approximately 10,000 people across numerous risk and control related groups and we're spending over $2.5 billion more per year than in 2018 in these areas and we are a stronger, better company for our customers, communities and employees. While we're moving forward with confidence, I will repeat what I've said in the past. Regulatory pressures on banks with longstanding issues such as ours is high, and until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. Additionally, as we implement heightened controls and oversight, new issues could be found and these may result in regulatory actions. At the same time, we're making progress on our risk and control work. We're executing on our strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time. We continue to introduce attractive new products as we build our credit card business. Last month, we launched Autograph Journey, designed for frequent travelers who can earn points wherever they book travel. Our new product offerings continue to drive strong credit card spend, up approximately $5 billion or 14% from a year ago. We continued to make investments in talent and technology to strengthen corporate and investment banking. More than 50 new senior hires have joined our CIB since 2019, with many of these in key coverage and product groups within banking. In February, Doug Braunstein, who has more than 35 years of industry experience, joined Wells Fargo as a Vice Chairman. Doug is a world class banker and he's working alongside the great team we've assembled to continue to grow the franchise. In addition, given the breadth of Doug's experience, he's also providing counsel on broader business issues beyond client development. As we look forward, it's always helpful to be grounded in the facts. We continue to see strength in the US economy. Spending patterns of consumers using our debit and credit cards remain generally consistent and continue to grow year-over-year. Consumer credit is performing as we expect. Wholesale credit continues to perform well and our views around commercial real estate have not significantly changed since last quarter. These are all positives. In addition, we remain committed and confident in our ability to increase efficiencies across the enterprise and areas we have targeted for investments such as credit card, investment banking and trading are performing well. We are beginning to see early signs of share and fee growth, which will be important as we diversify our revenues and reduce net interest income as a percentage of revenue. And we remain bullish on opportunities across our other businesses, again, more positive. Having said that, markets and rates will likely remain volatile, and as risk managers, we are prepared if trends were to change. We've historically managed credit through multiple cycles and believe that the actions we've taken over the last several years position us well. We have strong capital and liquidity positions. As we're building many of our businesses, we have done so within a consistent level of risk appetite, and our business model and franchise value differentiates us from most of who we compete with regardless of the environment. So what does all of this mean for our outlook? Simply said, our views haven't changed from last quarter. While we could look at specific data points on a specific date and alter our guidance, there is not enough of a consistent fact pattern to change our views, but what we see is helpful. Our focus remains the same. We are transforming Wells Fargo and are investing to build a well-controlled fast growing and higher returning company while we work to become more efficient. I'm pleased with the progress we've made and I'm optimistic about the future opportunities ahead. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the first quarter was $4.6 billion or $1.20 per diluted common share. Our first quarter results included $284 million or $0.06 per share for the FDIC special assessment as a result of the regional bank failures last year. Recall, last quarter our results included $1.9 billion for the special assessment and this additional amount reflects recent updates provided by the FDIC, including potential recoveries which were highlighted in their disclosure. The ultimate amount of our special assessment may continue to change as the FDIC determines the actual losses and recoveries to the deposit insurance funds. Turning to Slide 4. Net interest income declined $1.1 billion or 8% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates on funding costs, including the impact of customers migrating to higher yielding deposit products as well as lower loan balances, partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. First quarter results were largely as expected with loan balances a little lower and deposit balances in the businesses a little higher than our expectations. Our full year net interest income guidance has not changed from last quarter and we still expect 2024 net interest income to be approximately 7% to 9% lower than 2023. We also continue to expect net interest income will trough towards the end of this year. It is still early in the year and ultimately the amount of net interest income we earn will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including deposit balances, mix and pricing, the absolute level of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve and loan demand. On Slide 5, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both the fourth quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow while most other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 69 basis points from a year ago to over 6%, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 1% from a year ago, reflecting lower deposits in our consumer businesses as customers continued spending and reallocating cash into higher yielding alternatives. While growth in average deposits from the fourth quarter was modest, we have grown deposits in our commercial businesses for two consecutive quarters, which reflected our success in attracting clients' operational deposits. Period-end deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up 2% from the fourth quarter, but some of this growth reflected a temporary increase driven by quarter end that was on a payday and a holiday. While the pace of growth slowed, our average deposit costs continued to increase as expected, rising 16 basis points from the fourth quarter to 174 basis points, with higher deposit costs across most operating segments. Our mix of deposits continued to shift with our percentage of non-interest-bearing deposits declining to 26%. Turning to non-interest income on Slide 6. We were pleased with the growth in non-interest income across all of our business segments. Growth in non-interest income more than offset lower net interest income, reflecting a revenue growth from both the fourth quarter and a year ago. Non-interest income was up 17% from a year ago, with strong growth in investment advisory fees and brokerage commissions, deposit and lending fees, related fees, trading and investment banking fees. As Charlie highlighted, we benefited from market conditions as well as the investments we've been making in our businesses. I will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing the segment results. Turning to expenses on Slide 7, first quarter non-interest expense increased 5% from a year ago, driven by higher operating losses, the FDIC special assessment, an increase in revenue related compensation, predominantly due to higher investment advisory fees in our wealth and investment management business and higher technology and equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower professional and outside services expense, which declined 10% from a year ago. The higher operating losses were driven by customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we are working hard to get behind us. The increase in personnel expense from the fourth quarter was driven by approximately $650 million of seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement eligible employees and 401(k) matching contributions. Not including expense for the FDIC special assessment in the first quarter, our full year 2024 non-interest expense guidance is unchanged and is still expected to be approximately $52.6 billion. However, we continue to watch a couple of items. Our guidance included $1.3 billion of operating losses for the year, which we still believe is a reasonable estimate even with a higher level of operating losses in the first quarter. However, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year. Also, if market valuations remain at current levels or move higher, that would increase investment in advisory fees and revenue related compensation could be higher than we assumed in our expense guidance for this year, which would be a good thing. We'll continue to update you as the year progresses. Turning to credit quality on Slide 8. Net loan charge-offs declined 3 basis points from the fourth quarter to 50 basis points of average loans. Credit performance trends were consistent with what we saw last quarter. The decline reflected lower commercial net loan charge-offs, which were down $131 million from the fourth quarter to 25 basis points of average loans. The reduction was driven by lower losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio. We did not see further deterioration in the performance of our CRE office portfolio versus the fourth quarter and therefore our expectations have not changed. We continue to expect additional losses in the coming quarters. However, the amounts will likely be uneven and episodic. Consumer net loan charge-offs continue to increase as expected and were up $28 million from the fourth quarter to 84 basis points of average loans. While auto losses continue to decline, benefiting from the tightening actions we implemented starting in late 2021, credit card losses increased in line with our expectations. Non-performing assets declined 2% from the fourth quarter, driven by the lower CRE office non-accruals, reflecting the realization of losses and paydowns in the quarter. Moving to Slide 9. Based on the consistent credit trends I noted before, our allowance for credit losses was down modestly, driven by declines for commercial real estate and auto loans, partially offset by higher allowance for credit card loans. The table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. We didn't increase our allowance for this portfolio in the first quarter and the coverage ratio in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio of 11% was stable compared with the fourth quarter. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong and our CET-1 ratio of 11.2% continue to be well above our 8.9% regulatory minimum plus buffers. We repurchased $6.1 billion of common stock in the first quarter. While the amount of stock we repurchased each quarter will vary, we continue to expect to repurchase more common stock this year than we did in 2023. Turning to our operating segment, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Consumer, small and business banking revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by our lower deposit balances. We continue to invest in talent, technology and branches to improve the customer experience. Our branches are becoming more advice focused with teller transactions declining while banker visits have increased. We are modernizing and optimizing the branch network. The number of branches declined 6% from a year ago, while at the same time, we are accelerating the refurbishment of our branch network. In addition, the enhancements we are making to our mobile app continue to drive momentum in mobile adoption and we surpassed 30 million active mobile customers in the first quarter, up 6% from a year ago. Mobile logins also reached a milestone, surpassing 2 billion logins for the first time in the first quarter, up 18% from a year ago. Home lending revenue was stable from a year ago as higher mortgage banking income was offset by lower net interest income as loan balances continued to decline. Credit card revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by the higher loan balances. Payment rates remain relatively stable compared to the fourth quarter and were above pre-pandemic levels. Auto revenue declined 23% from a year ago, driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal Lending revenue was up 7% from a year ago and included the impact of higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers in Slide 12. Retail mortgage originations declined 38% from a year ago, reflecting the progress we made on our strategic objective to simplify the business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. We also made significant progress in reducing the amount of third-party mortgage loans we serviced, down 21% from a year ago. We also continued to reduce the headcount in home lending, which was down 33% from a year ago. Balances in our auto portfolio were down 12% compared to last year. Origination volume declined 18% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions, but increased 24% from a slow fourth quarter. Debit card spend increased 4% from a year ago with growth in most categories except for fuel and travel. Credit card spending remains strong. It was up 14% from a year ago. All categories grew with stronger growth in nondiscretionary spend. New account growth continued to be strong, up 12% from last year. Turning to Commercial Banking results in Slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs partially offset by higher deposit related fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 7% year-over-year and included lower revenue from equity investments. Average loan balances were stable compared to a year ago as growth in asset-based lending and leasing was offset by declines in middle-market banking. Weaker loan demand reflected the impact of clients being cautious given the higher-rate environment and the anticipation of lower rates this year as well as some potential uncertainty in an election year. Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 5% from a year ago, driven by higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products. Our results benefited from the areas where we have had strength for some time, such as investment-grade debt capital markets and from the talent we've been attracting into the business. While it\u2019s still early, we are encouraged by the green shoots we are seeing. Commercial real-estate revenue was down 7% from a year-ago and included the impact of lower loan balances. Markets revenue increased 2% from a year-ago, driven by continued strong performance in structured products, credit products, and foreign-exchange. Our trading results continue to benefit from market conditions and the investments we've made in technology and talent to round out the business have enabled us to produce strong results even as market dynamics have changed. Average loans declined 4% from a year ago. Banking clients have taken advantage of strong capital markets to pay-off loans. In addition to weak loan demand in commercial real-estate given market conditions, balances also declined due to credit tightening actions we implemented last year, along with our efforts to actively reduce certain property types in the portfolios. On Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 2% compared to a year-ago. Lower net interest income driven by lower deposit balances as customers reallocated cash into higher-yielding alternatives was more than offset by higher asset-based fees due to increased market valuations. While cash alternatives as a percentage of total client assets was higher than a year ago, it has declined in the past two quarters as the migration of deposits into cash alternatives has slowed significantly. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so first-quarter results reflected market valuations as of January 1st, which were higher from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the second quarter will reflect market valuations as of April 1st, which were higher from both a year ago and from January 1st. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments. In summary, our results in the first quarter reflected the progress we're making to improve our financial performance. We grew revenue, driven by strong growth in our fee-based businesses. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. We increased capital returns to shareholders and maintained our strong capital position. We'll now take your questions. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Guys, I wanted to ask about your profitability targets and kind of how you're seeing the journey to the mid-teens ROTCE goal. Mike, maybe you could talk about that through the lens of 12% return on tangible common equity this quarter. Where do you think you're kind of over-earning, under-earning, and what does that journey to the mid-teens look like over the next couple of years? Mike Santomassimo : Hey, John, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So, look, I think not much has changed in our thinking on the topic. And so as you sort of think about it on a long-term basis, there's no reason -- we still -- there's still no reason why our businesses shouldn't have returns like the best of our peers. And as we sort of go through that journey, obviously we are where we are in terms of the returns today. And as we get towards closer to 15%, it's going to be the same kinds of drivers that we've been talking about now for a while. We've got to continue to optimize sort of capital and balance sheet. You saw us return some via buybacks today. We're making investments on each of our businesses, and so we'll need to start seeing some of the returns there. And this was one quarter of it, but a good quarter that shows some of the benefits of those investments we're making across a whole range of the businesses, which is good to see. And Charlie highlighted a bunch of that in his commentary. And then we've got to stay on the efficiency journey, which we continue to believe is not done. And we've got a lot of work to do to continue to drive efficiency across the company. And we're going to stay at that as we look forward. And so I think it's really those drivers that get in. And we still have confidence that we're going to get there. Charlie Scharf : Hey, John, let me -- it\u2019s Charlie. Let me just add a couple of things. Number one is, just as a reminder to everyone, we've tried to be clear as NII was rising and we got to, certainly either at the peak or near the peaks that we were outearning and that we didn't look at those ROEs at those points as sustainable, but that our clear journey was to continue to get there on a sustainable basis. I think second of all, when we look at, obviously it's very hard to draw any conclusion from a specific quarter, right? You've got the FDIC, we've got operating losses, which we've talked about where our expectations are for the full year, which are different than the quarter. So it's very hard to draw a conclusion on a specific quarter. But when we look at what is going to get us there, we are very consistent on what those things are. Number one is improved business performance. And we tried to highlight where we see that and those areas that we don't talk about are areas that we are still bullish on but would like to see some more improvement in the ability to increase our returns in those parts of the company as well as continued capital return as well as the limitations we have because of the asset cap. So again, our thesis hasn't changed, our views haven't changed, and our confidence in getting there hasn't changed. John McDonald : Okay. And then one just quick follow up there. Do you think this 11% CET-1 is probably kind of the ballpark of where you hang out regardless of the minimum just because it feels like you have super regional banks that aren't G-SIBs are running at, 10%, 10.5%. You have bigger banks at 12%, 13%. Does 11% kind of feel like the right ballpark, which means you can return most of what you're generating now? Charlie Scharf : I would say it's something that we continue to think through. You know our existing needs today with buffers are at 8.9%. At 8.9%, everyone understands that Basel III Endgame is coming, but likely with significant revisions. So I think as the quarters continue, we'll learn more about where that will come out and we'll be able to be more informed about where we'll wind up. We've always tried to be on the more conservative end, but there's a point at which too much is too much, which is why we bought the amount this quarter that we bought back. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess just following up on that, as we think about Basel, your capital levels, even with 100 basis points above, you probably have $12 billion of excess capital. Given what we saw in 1Q and I heard you Mike, year-over-year you're going to be higher, but that doesn't give enough color. I'm just wondering should we expect the pace of buybacks to continue given that where the stock\u2019s trading which is still fairly effective valuations? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, thanks. It\u2019s Mike, thanks for the question. As you look at the pacing, we're really not going to provide specific guidance on, like, what we'll do quarter to quarter. I think, obviously, as you pointed out, we've got significant excess capital to where we need to be. We'll be able to handle with whatever comes out of Basel III quite easily with where we are today, gives us the ability to be there and invest as we've got opportunities with clients. And so we've got lots of flexibility. And each quarter, we'll go through the same process we go through every quarter, which is thinking about sort of where the capital requirements are going to go, looking at all the different risks that are out there across the spectrum, whether it's rates or other, and then looking at what we're seeing from client activity, and then we'll make a decision on the pacing of it. But as you say, we're still very confident we'll do more than we did last year, but pacing we\u2019ll kind of leave to -- we'll cover that each quarter after we report. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And I guess just separately, I think there's a lot of focus on market share opportunity for Wells, be it in capital markets, IB, corporate lending, and I think Charlie referenced the hiring of Doug Braunstein. Would appreciate additional color in terms of areas where you see within corporate capital markets where there's market share to be had and what's the level of investment/infrastructure needed in order for competing in that space and winning market share? Charlie Scharf : Yeah, let me start out. I think, first of all, when we talk about the level of investment that's necessary, we're making the investment, and it's embedded in what we're spending. And so, we are funding that through normal course of business. Some of the folks that we're hiring, are replacing other people and others are additions, but that's part of what it is. And so we don't anticipate any kind of step-up in the expense base to fund what we're doing, which we feel great about. We've got the ability to spend along the way and to actually see them paying off for itself. And I said this very consistently, which is we are extremely under-penetrated across almost all segments of the investment banking space. We've been stronger on the debt side. We have not been as strong on the equity side. And by the way, all for reasons that relate to our own willingness to invest over the last decade and a half, not because of the opportunity or because of our business model. It's just the opposite. It's just not something that the senior management team here was supportive of, and we feel very differently than that. And so when we look across coverage in the equity space by industry on the strategic side and how that relates to our existing high quality debt platform that we have, again, we're prioritizing industries based upon where we already have strength in relationship and where there are significant wallets. But we feel really great about our ability to serve a broad set of customers and their desire to do business with us because of both the platform and the talent that we have here. And then when we look at our -- the trading side of our business, a big part of what we do there is to support our efforts within the investment bank, but it also is to leverage the broader institutional relationships that we have, where we do a lot with those institutions, but we haven't necessarily leveraged trading flow as part of that. And so to do that, we're making investments not just in people, but in technology. We are, as I alluded to, we're not doing any of this by rethinking the way we think of our risk tolerances. It really is about getting the right products, the right services, the right people, and calling on our customer base with a different degree of credibility and desire that we've had in the past. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's a [good] (ph) color. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Houston of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir. Ken Houston : Thank you. Good morning. I'm wondering if we could talk a little bit about just that kind of last mile of deposit repricing. You talked about the mix shift and non-interest down and interest bearing up, but just wondering just what's happening on the pricing side and are you still seeing both sides, consumer and wholesale, if you can maybe just kind of give us the dynamics that's happening underneath and how you expect that to continue as we get to this, as we stay in this rates peak? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Sure. I'll take that, Ken. As you look at the commercial side, not much has changed. It's pretty competitive. We're not seeing it move one way or the other in a significant way as you sort of look over the last quarter. Good news is we've been able to attract good operating deposits in corporate investment bank. We've seen some growth in commercial bank as well. And so all that's kind of performing as you'd expect. And you wouldn't really expect pricing to move there until the Fed starts to move. And it'll stay pretty competitive at that point. And we still expect betas to be pretty high on the way down as you start to see that eventually happen. On the consumer side, standard pricing is not moving. Really what you're seeing is you're seeing people continue to spend some of the money that's in their checking accounts and/or move some of it into either CDs or higher yielding savings accounts. And so you still see some of that activity happening across the consumer space and the well space where you still have some people moving into higher yielding alternatives. The pace of that migration has slowed, at least for now. And so, we'll see how that progresses through the rest of the year, but it has slowed a bit over the last number of months. Ken Houston : Okay. And on the lending side, I think what you guys showed is not unexpected at all based on general softness at the start of the year. So I think you and others have just kind of generically hoped that we get an improvement. But with rates where they are, is there any impediment to just seeing an improvement in loan growth as the year goes on or is it baked into kind of the demand function that you're seeing underneath? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, I think what we're seeing so far is exactly what we expected to see at the beginning of the year. And I know there's people -- different people have different views, back in January. But this is exactly what we expected, which is pretty low demand. Now, as I said in my commentary, it's a little bit lower than what we had modeled, but not substantially at this point. And it really is a demand function. When you look at what we're hearing from clients in the commercial bank or some of the clients in the corporate investment bank, they're being cautious still and saying, okay, I'm not going to build inventories as much as I might in a different environment. They're being thoughtful about the cost of credit and how that impacts investments they're making or the timing and the pacing of that. And so on the commercial side, it really is a demand issue at this point. On the consumer side, you continue to see some growth in card balances. Given the size of the balance sheet, that's not going to move the whole balance sheet very materially given where we start from. And then the mortgage side just continues to decline a little bit given the market that we've got there. And in auto, we're seeing a little bit more decline given some of the changes we made about a year and a half ago, a year, year and a half ago on some of the credit tightening and eventually that will start to turn. So I think those are the dynamics that we're seeing right now. Ken Houston : Okay. Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Charlie Scharf : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hey. Okay, a couple of just quickies here. One is, on the net interest income outlook that's unchanged, could you remind us what the interest rate environment is that's the base case for that analysis? Mike Santomassimo : Sure. Hey, it's Mike, Betsy. Welcome back. Sure. When you look at the environment, we're not guessing at sort of what's going to happen, right? So, I think as you sort of look at the different variables that are embedded in our baseline forecast is that we would expect somewhere around three rate cuts this year. And that's what's underlying sort of our thinking at this point. Betsy Graseck : And was that the same as last quarter, same assumption set, or has that changed? Mike Santomassimo : No. I mean -- yeah, no, like it's definitely less than what I think was being projected by the market. And that's what we wanted put out on our slide in January. And when you look at the impact of that in isolation, you certainly would see a benefit from less rate cuts. But I do think you have to put that in the context of, okay, now what's going to happen with client behavior and mix shifts as we look for the rest of the year? I mean, it's certainly clear we feel better today than we did in January about our guidance and our forecast there, but I do think we have to let some more time play out to see how people react to what's happening. And I think even you got to be really careful to take what happened over a day or two and extrapolate too far, right? We're seeing a bunch of that be given back today even. And what we've seen over the last couple of years is that every time you have this strong reaction, either up or down in expectation for rates, that reaction tends to moderate a little bit over a pretty short period of time. And so we'll see how that plays out. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And obviously, we've had quite a bit of activity volatility on the long end of the curve. How do you think about that? And is there opportunity set for maybe pulling in some more deposits and reinvesting in securities given the slightly improved long end rates here? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. And we've started to do that to some degree in the first quarter where we have been starting to buy some securities, mainly mortgages, given where rates and levels have been. And that's been a good trade, I think, for us so far. And so I think you'll certainly see us continue to deploy more cash into securities, at least at some modest levels as we look forward over the next quarter. Betsy Graseck : Okay, super. Thanks so much, Mike. Operator : The next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Just to follow up on Betsy's question, on the net interest income outlook, you had a peer that had a more modest upgrade to that outlook than expected. You held firm on your NII guide. I guess to that end, as we think through whether or not there are [three cuts] (ph) or no cuts, above and beyond just marking to market, the NII to the rate curve is the implication to volumes, right? Like, you mentioned in response to Betsy's question, the client behavior. And so I guess I just wanted to understand in terms of the range of outcomes of zero, which is being talked about a couple of days ago, to -- with three embedded in your estimate, how should we think about how you're thinking about volumes in terms of loans and deposit behavior? In other words, have you considered a wider range of volume outcomes as you think about the curve outlook? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. No, I'll try to -- I'll take an attempt at that, Erika, and you can tell me if I covered it all. But it's certainly -- we're at a point in time, and I said this on a call with media earlier this morning, like, we're at a time where it's difficult to sort of model the different outcomes that you could expect to see with net interest income, just given all the dynamics that are happening there. And as you said, like, I think the fact that rates might be higher than what people expected a week ago, that could change first of all, but let's stipulate. At this point, people are thinking it's going to be higher for a little bit longer. We do have to wait and see how clients are going to react. And I think we do our best to try to come up with a range of outcomes there. And given that -- given what's happening in rates plus what's happening in quantitative tightening, what's happening in sort of the economy overall, it's going to all matter in terms of what happens with deposit levels. And let's see how that plays out. But I think as I come back to what I said earlier, we feel better than we did today than we did in January about where we are, but there's a lot to play out for the rest of the year. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just a follow-up, kind of a two-part question but hopefully very related to one another. It was -- the lifting of the consent order was clearly huge for how the market was perceiving Wells. As we think about further remediation, how should we think about how you're thinking about the potential cost saves that you could extract from all the processes that may be in place has been focused solely on the remediation? And I ask that not in light of the usual recycled question, but clearly had a massive outperformance, like Ebrahim mentioned, on investment banking and trading. And as we think about those expenses, should we start expecting the reinvestment back to potentially accelerate? And also on investment banking and trading, I know there's a lot of seasonality, but are these new run rates? I guess it's hard for us to tell what the base is because obviously, as you -- as Charlie mentioned, you're underpenetrated across the board. So should we continue to see a moving up of this base despite the seasonality as we look forward? Charlie Scharf : Okay, there's a lot in there. Let me start, Mike, and then you chime in. So first of all, Mike, you can comment on like investment banking and trading. But again, we're -- I mean, we're not going to answer the question on how you should think about what investment banking and trading will be in the future. What we're focused on are, are we building businesses? Are we taking share in a way which is profitable? And that's exactly what we're starting to do. And there is volatility of the business, but we're focused on building it over a period of time and that's what we're seeing. And so the way we would think about it when we look at our own forecasting is we would expect to see our market shares rise over a period of time, and quarter by quarter, know that it will be subject to volatility that exists. Mike Santomassimo : And when you think about the first quarter in particular, there's always going to be seasonality on the trading side. That happens pretty much every year. So you can't just take that as a run rate. And on the investment banking side, you've certainly seen some very high issuance volumes on the investment-grade debt side. So that's likely maybe pulling some issuance forward later in the year but we'll see. And then some of the M&A revenue that's embedded in there can be somewhat episodic and volatile, just given the timing of deals and closings and stuff. And so you do have to look at those two lines over a longer period of time. Charlie Scharf : And then on your question on expenses, again, it is -- we were in the exact same place that we've been, which is we're not thinking about at all. We're not doing work. We're not thinking about whether there are efficiencies to be gotten out of all the risk and control work that we're doing. In fact, we're still on the other side of that, which is, we still have more open consent orders and we're still committed to do whatever is necessary, including spending whatever is necessary to get that work done properly and build it into the infrastructure of the company. I've said there'll be a point at which when it's built into what we do and there's a high degree of confidence that it is part of the culture and our processes, that we will have an opportunity to figure out how to do some of those things more efficiently. But that's not on our radar screen at all. What is on our radar screen is the fact that there's still a lot of inefficiency left within the company completely away from the money that we're spending on this. And that's where we're focused, and that's why we have the ability to invest in card and invest in investment banking and trading and accelerate the branch refurbishments and hire more bankers in commercial banking and things like that. So I would just still continue to separate the fact that we're committed to get the work done, we're going to do whatever is necessary to spend there, and that's not the area of focus for us when it comes to efficiency. Erika Najarian : That was clear, Charlie. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. So I wanted to start off just on a question maybe unpacking the NII commentary a bit more. In the prepared remarks, Mike, you noted that you expected NII to be troughing towards the end of this year. So less concerned about the full year '24 outlook. I was hoping you could just speak to the inputs or assumptions that, that's supporting that expectation around troughing or stabilization, given further rate cuts that are reflected in the forward curve beyond '24. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. When you look at all the different factors, Steve, there's obviously nothing that's sort of unique to sort of our balance sheet. But when you look at both the asset repricing that's happening in securities, you look at what's happening and you just sort of project forward on sort of the loans and the other parts of the balance sheet, that's obviously a key input as you sort of look forward. And then at some point, you would expect that the migration and deposit mix starts to stabilize as you go forward. And I'm a little intentional, and I'm intentional in the words we use in terms of towards the end of the year. Is it right at this year? Is it early next year? Like, it's going to be -- we're getting closer to that point in terms of when it's going to trough. Calling the exact date with a high degree of certainty is difficult in this environment. But it's all the things that sort of we've talked about over the coming -- over the last few quarters are going to drive that. And it starts with like deposits and deposit mix and deposit pricing and then goes through the rest of where we think the assets sort of net out. Steven Chubak : That's helpful color. And for my follow-up, might be regretting this question, but Charlie, it relates to how you responded to Erika's last one relating to the asset cap specifically. I recognize that you're focused internally on just addressing or remediating all the various consent orders. But externally, investors are clearly spending much more time evaluating the different potential sources of earnings or return uplift once these regulatory restrictions are eliminated, whether it's deposit recapture, growth in trading book and reduction in that elevated risk and control spend. Don't expect you to quantify it, don't expect you to speculate on timing for when the asset cap can get lifted. But just given that focus for investors, it might just be helpful if you can contextualize how you're thinking about some of those potential benefits. Charlie Scharf : Sure. And I'm not sure you shouldn't feel, like, [afraid] (ph) you asked the question. You guys always should ask whatever you want. I just try to be as clear as I can on what I think we'll be in a position to answer, and I don't want you guys to get frustrated by the level of consistency of the things that we want to be careful about. But to your question, which is, I think, entirely reasonable, I'd put into a couple of categories. I think first of all, probably the most important thing with the asset cap, quite frankly, is not the pure economics at this point that will come from the lifting of the asset cap. It is still a reputational overhang for us. And while the lifting of the sales practices consent order was extremely important for those that have just read the newspapers, certainly those that follow the stock care a lot about the asset cap and we understand that. And so that is just initially, I think, an important factor in terms of how we'll be viewed as opposed to what we'll actually do. I think when we look at what we have done to proactively manage the company to keep ourselves below the asset cap, there are two -- you've got two categories. You've got places where we have gone and said, please make your business smaller because -- just because of normal deposit flows and consumer business and things like that, we'll have some asset pressure and we need to offset at some place. And then there's the opportunity cost of what we haven't been able to do because we've had the asset cap. And then what does that mean going forward? On the first piece, we have limited our ability certainly within our trading businesses for some very low-risk things such as financing our customers and things like that. So by not allowing them to provide a level of financing, which is very low risk, we have not captured as much trading flow as we otherwise would have seen. In our corporate businesses, we've been very, very careful to encourage our bankers to bring in sizable corporate deposits that weren't clearly operational deposits, and in some cases, been a little more aggressive about asking them actually not to have it here because we wanted to make room for other things that we thought were really important strategically such as not being closed for business on the consumer side, which those folks would not understand, is hopefully just something that's temporary. So those are the places that in the short term would benefit from the asset cap being lifted. I think when you get beyond that, the reality is, when you look at what we've been able to do and the amount of excess capital that we have, we're trying to deploy that by -- through the dividend and through our share buybacks because there's only so much that we should keep around and not return to shareholders. But we still -- as I talked about, we think there are plenty of opportunities when you look around our different businesses to achieve higher returns by reinvesting it inside the business. It's not anything which is -- I would describe it as dramatic. But in terms of the things that we can do when we don't have the constraints, take our -- whether it's our consumer business or our wealth business to build out our banking product set, to be more aggressive about being full spectrum in terms of where we are on the lending side and the deposit side. Across all of our businesses, we've been very, very conservative in what we have asked people to do because we don't want to have an asset cap issue. So again, I would describe it as, it's the -- it would be the ability to grow in the things that we're confident at that we do well, that we have, in some ways, consciously and in some ways, unconsciously restrained the company from doing. But all in all, certainly, without an asset cap, it's not a neutral. It's a positive because of the things that we proactively stopped as well as we're just limited in our ability to take advantage of the franchise that we have. And you've seen others that don't have those constraints but have the quality franchise as well, and you see how they\u2019ve benefited not just versus us but versus the broader banking set. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s really helpful context, Charlie. Thanks so much for taking my question. Charlie Scharf : Of course. Operator : The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. On the 2024 NII guide, I understand that you feel better about the NII outlook here but you're watching customer behavior. I know you did mention loan growth. Did you lower your loan growth outlook that's baked into that guidance this quarter versus what you had in there last quarter? And either way, are you able to help us with what that expectation is on the loan growth front? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. John, it's Mike. What we said in January is that we expected loans to decline in the first half, and so that's about what we're seeing, right? So again, it's slightly lower than what we modeled, but it's pretty close to sort of what our expectation. And then we expect a little bit of growth in the second half of the year and overall balances weren't going to do much for the full year. And so at this point, could we be off on that a little bit? Maybe. And could it be a little lower? Maybe. Could it be a little higher? Yeah, for sure. And so -- but I think the more meaningful drivers this year of where NII ends up, it's going to come back to deposits, right? And what's the level? What's the mix? What's the pricing look like, given where the environment is? And I think that will be the more meaningful place to focus. John Pancari : Okay. And related to that, any deposit growth expectation that you could share? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. I mean, I think again, it's -- our full year guidance that we gave you or assumptions we gave you in January, where we thought the commercial side would be pretty flat to where we are, to where we started the year, that's coming in slightly better than what we had modeled. In the consumer side, we would likely see a little bit of more decline as well as mix shift. And again, that's what you're seeing so far. Charlie Scharf : Listen, we just -- we want to be really careful in all this, right? We're not -- we're trying to be as transparent as we can be about what we're seeing without getting over our skis and making predictions that none of us have the answers to. And so like when you boil it all down in terms of the customer activity that we're seeing, it's a touch less here, a touch more there. There's not a big change from what we said three months ago in terms of flows on the deposit and the lending side. It really is relatively small relative to the big NII picture and what's going to drive NII at this point. So if we saw big changes there, we might say, let's change guidance. But it's tweaking along the way and we'll see how it continues to pan out. And then what we said is relative to the rate environment, it's just -- again, it's -- this is a full year number and we've had a couple of months go by. It's just too early to mark the whole thing to market based upon that. But again, we also wanted to just provide the context, as Mike has said and I said in my remarks, certainly, what we've seen is helpful relative to just the pure overall rate and curve piece of it. John Pancari : Okay, that's very helpful. I appreciate the color there. If I could just ask one more along the credit side. NPA decline is encouraging there and I know it can be volatile. Can you just maybe talk about NPA inflows? Did you see a pullback there? Did you see that on the CRE side? Is there anything to [extract from] (ph) that? Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. No, look, I think what you're seeing on the -- when you talk about commercial real estate, you're really talking about office. And what you saw in the office space is actually, it did not move at all and get worse or not get worse in the quarter. And so you actually saw non-performing assets coming down a little bit in the CRE space as we've charged off some loans, and they weren't replaced by other items. And so that's a positive in the sense that it's not deteriorating at this point. And then everything else is sort of moving around like as you would expect. There's not substantial movements across the rest of the portfolio. John Pancari : Great. Thanks, Mike. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi, good morning. I want to follow up on the comment that costs this year could come in higher on higher revenues, investment advisory, and I would assume the same if banking and trading continue to be so strong. Obviously, that's a net positive to earnings overall. But how would you frame the operating leverage if you can pick which revenue buckets, but if those market-sensitive revenues are $1 billion higher, is there kind of 40% cost [against that] (ph), 50%? How would you frame that? Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. And really what we're referring to when we mention that is primarily in the wealth management business is where we're focused, given where market levels are. And that business is -- the cost-to-income ratio is pretty stable there in terms of the revenue-related comp. And so it's a little less than 50% in terms of how to think about it. So the operating leverage is good. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And then just specifically on banking and trading, I know you guys invested in those businesses so there's upfront costs when the revenues come. But it seems like the operating leverage in that segment has been very, very strong. And is that something that you think can continue if those revenues continue to surprise or could we see some upward pressure to cost from that, again, a positive to earnings overall but -- thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. No, look, I think the cost to invest there, as Charlie noted, is in our numbers, right, so that's already there. So we're already anticipating that. And at this point, we don't see that being a big pressure point one way or the other. But obviously, as you know, if revenues like far exceed our expectations in a positive way, that would come with a little bit of comp, too. So that would be a good thing overall. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yeah, agreed. Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Mike and Charlie. Mike, you touched on your non-interest-bearing deposits declined to about 26% of deposits. Do you guys have a sense what's the long-term normalization level for non-interest-bearing deposits as you look out over the 12-month horizon? Assuming rates do not go up, we have stable rates, maybe they come down a little bit? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. Look, I mean, it's a hard thing to say with a whole lot of certainty, Gerard, in terms of exactly where it's going to stabilize. It will stabilize at some point, particularly as you look at the underlying mix of the consumer deposit base, right? A good chunk of our consumer deposits are in accounts less than [2.50] (ph). They are generally operating accounts for a lot of people, and so this thing will stabilize as we go. But as you've seen, we've had some pretty consistent, plus or minus a little bit, each quarter as we've gone through the last number of quarters. But at some point soon, that will start to -- we would expect that to stabilize, but we'll see exactly where it does. Gerard Cassidy : And is it fair to assume that the rate of change in the deposit betas is declining, where eventually those deposit betas flatten out as well? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. Once you start seeing more stabilization in the mix, that's when you'll see deposit costs on the consumer side stabilize, right? Because what you're seeing now is people -- as I mentioned earlier, people are spending money in their checking account, low interest cost for us. And then you're seeing growth in CDs and some of the savings accounts, which are higher cost. And that mix shift will stabilize. It's very related to your first question around non-interest-bearing, right? Once -- they're kind of related together, right? Once you get to sort of that core operating balance in people's accounts, then that's when you'll see both of those stabilize. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just as a follow-up on credit, obviously, you guys put up overall good numbers and especially in that commercial real estate area, as you highlighted. Coming back to the credit cards, you pointed out that the charge-offs were up, but they\u2019re in line with the expectations. Assuming the economy does not head into a recession later this year and unemployment goes up to 6%, say it stays around 4%, what are you guys thinking for like a peak in net charge-offs or credit cards? And when do you think you could reach that? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. Look, I think you got to really dig into the underlying dynamics of what's happening in the portfolio, right? We're in the middle of a refresh of our product set. We're seeing faster growth in new accounts and new balances coming on than maybe other players, just given the investments we've been making now for the better part of three years. And so that -- with that comes some maturation of kind of the new vintages. At some point, that should peak and you'll start to see sort of the normal behavior. But I'd just come back to, we spend a lot of time looking at each of the underlying vintages here. Everything is performing pretty much -- very much on top of what we would have expected or, in a couple of cases, maybe slightly better. And the quality of the new accounts we're putting on are -- the credit quality of them looks very good and continues to be the case. So I would just say that we're in that normal phase of maturation. And as it sort of peaks, we'll sort of let you know when we sort of feel like we're there, but it should be coming over the coming quarters. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will come from Dave Rochester of Compass Point Research. Your line is open, sir. Dave Rochester : Hey, good morning, guys. Appreciate all the color on the NII and loan trend outlook. I was just wondering on the loan side, if you've noted any sensitivity at all in activity levels in general amongst your commercial customers to Presidential elections in the past. And how big of a headwind, if any, you think that could be this year? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. I mean, that's hard. I think certainly, it will be a factor that people incorporate into their thinking of how aggressive or not they want to be and investments they're making. But at this point, that would be really hard to kind of prove out with any sort of empirical data. I think at this point, what we're seeing most is related to the overall sort of macroeconomic environment we're in with such high rates and people having some uncertainty just generally around where things go from here. So, but I'm sure that will factor in at least to a small degree at some point as we go through the year. Dave Rochester : Yeah. Okay, appreciate that. And then just on the trading line, Matt had mentioned the momentum you've seen earlier. You obviously had a great year in trading last year. You had your strongest quarter yet this year. And you've talked about making a lot of investments in the business in recent years. You're still making those now. It seems like you have a lot of momentum in this area where you could grow that this year as well despite having a huge year last year. Just wanted to get your take on all that. Mike Santomassimo : Well, the environment is going to matter a lot. And so we've certainly been helped by some of the volatility that we've seen over the last four, five quarters. And so that could change the outcome quite materially for all of us in the industry and the trading line. So keep that in mind. But as you said, we're continuing to make -- systematically make some investments there, and we feel good about that. And I think we continue to see some good performance from a market share point of view across those places we've been making the investments. But as Charlie also noted, we're somewhat constrained in some of those businesses. But we feel good about the progress that the team has made over the last couple of years. Dave Rochester : All right. Great. Thanks. Operator : And our final question for today will come from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open, sir. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Couple of questions. Firstly, financial advisors. Can you give some color on what those numbers have been doing over the past year, past quarter since that's not disclosed anymore? Are you building? What types of advisors? Is that new recruits from college? Any color, Mike? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah, sure. So as you pointed out, over the last -- if you go back a couple of years ago, and you definitely saw some declines that we were seeing in the advisor workforce. But Barry Sommers and team have been working really hard to sort of not only stem some of the attrition but also begin to really ramp up the recruiting again. And I think we're starting to see some of that come through. And so a lot of that -- we're back to like more normal, maybe slightly below normal attrition levels across the business, which is good. And we're feeling very good about our ability to recruit high-quality advisors. And so I think that trend you saw a couple of years ago was definitely different. And we'll continue to stay at it. We're mostly focused on experienced advisors, a little less on, as you mentioned, college recruits and that type of thing. Charlie Scharf : Yes, the only thing I\u2019d -- listen, Vivek, this is -- I mean, we're recruiting -- I mean, it's across -- there's no one prototype here. We are -- we've recruited some of the biggest teams in the country that have traded over the last year and half. And these are people that wouldn't have come to Wells Fargo before that because of the issues. And it was competitive and they chose to come here because of our capabilities, not because of what we're willing to pay them. At the same side, we're staffing up in our bank branches and those are more entry-level people. People come out of the banker workforce. And it's going to be across the board. But there's no doubt that the trajectory we have with our FA population is very different today than several years ago. Vivek Juneja : Okay, that's helpful. A completely different question. I want to go back to NII, not to beat a dead horse. But given that higher rates -- I mean, sorry, less rate cuts are better for you, if we -- so that should help NII now. But if we see rate cuts and eventually in '25, does that mean that the troughing of NII could get pushed further back? Mike Santomassimo : Yeah. I mean, look, we'll see, Vivek, where it exactly troughs. Obviously, sort of the exact pace of rate cuts is part of the equation, but we also have to look at sort of the broader trends that we've talked about throughout the call, right? And how do depositors sort of react? Where does the mix shift stabilize? And how do -- what do we see from a competitive environment? So all of that matters as you sort of look at where exactly it's going to trough. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. John Campbell : All right. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate it. We'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you, all, for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today, where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, John. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. So let me start with some second quarter highlights. Our financial performance in the quarter benefited from our ongoing efforts to transform Wells Fargo. We continue to generate strong fee-based revenue growth with increases across most categories compared to a year ago due to both the investments we're making in our businesses and favorable market conditions with particular strength in investment advisory, trading activities and investment banking. These results more than offset the expected decline in net interest income. Credit performance during the second quarter was consistent with our expectations. Consumers have benefited from a strong labor market and wage increases. The performance of our consumer auto portfolio continued to improve, reflecting prior credit tightening actions and we had net recoveries in our home lending portfolio. While losses in our credit card portfolio increased as expected, early delinquency performance of our recent vintages was aligned with expectations. In our commercial portfolios, losses continued to be driven by commercial real-estate office properties where we expect losses to remain lumpy. Fundamentals in the institutional-owned office real-estate market continued to deteriorate as lower appraisals reflect the weak leasing market in many large metropolitan areas across the country. However, they still remain within the assumptions we made when setting our allowance for credit losses. We continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives, which has driven headcount to decline for 16 consecutive quarters. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the first quarter. The higher interest-rate environment and anticipation of rate cuts continued to result in tepid commercial loan demand, and we have not changed our underwriting standards to chase growth. Balanced growth in our credit card portfolio was more than offset by declines across our other consumer portfolios. Average deposits grew modestly from the first quarter with higher balances in all of our consumer-facing lines of businesses. Now, let me update you on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and controller. We are a different Wells Fargo from when I arrived. Our operational and compliance risk and control build-out is our top priority and will remain so until all deliverables are completed and we embed this mindset into our culture, similar to the discipline we have for financial and credit risk today. We continue to make progress by completing deliverables that are part of our plans. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment. While we see clear forward momentum, it's up to our regulators to make their own judgments and decide when the work is done to their satisfaction. Progress has not been easy, but tens of thousands of my partners at Wells Fargo have now worked tirelessly for years to deliver the kind of change necessary for a company of our size and complexity, and we will not rest until we satisfy the expectations of our regulators and the high standards we have set for ourselves. While we have made substantial changes and have meaningfully improved our control environment, the industry operates in a heightened regulatory oversight environment, and we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. We are also a different Wells Fargo in how we are executing on other strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time. Let me highlight a few examples of the progress we're making. We're diverging revenue sources and reducing our reliance on net interest income. We are improving our credit card platform with more competitive offerings, which is both - which is important both for our customers and strategically for the Company. During the second quarter, we launched two new credit cards, a small-business card and a consumer card. Since 2021, we have launched nine new credit cards and are almost complete in our initial product build-out. The momentum in this business is demonstrated by continued strong credit card spend and new account growth. We are not lowering our credit standards, but see that our strong brand and a great value proposition are being well-received by the market. Building a large credit card business is an investment as new products have significant upfront costs related to marketing, promo rates, onboarding and allowance, which drive little profitability in the early years. But as long as our assumptions on spend, balanced growth, and credit continue to play out as expected, we expect the card business to meaningfully contribute to profit growth in the future as the portfolio matures. We have been methodically growing our corporate investment bank, which has been a priority and continues to be a significant opportunity for us. We are executing on a multi-year investment plan while maintaining our strong risk discipline and our positive momentum continues. We have added significant talent over the past several years and we'll continue to do so in targeted areas where we see opportunities for growth. Fernando Rivas recently joined Wells Fargo as Co-CEO of Corporate Investment Banking. Fernando has deep knowledge of our industry and his background and skills complement the terrific team Jon Weiss has put together. While we view our work here as a long-term commitment, we expect to see results in the short and medium term and are encouraged by the improved performance we've already seen with strong growth in investment banking fees during the first half of the year. In our Wealth and Investment Management business, we have substantially improved advisor retention and have increased the focus on serving independent advisers and our consumer banking clients, which should ultimately help drive growth. In the commercial Bank, we are focused on growing our treasury management business, adding bankers to cover segments where we are underpenetrated, and delivering our investment banking and markets capabilities to clients and believe we have significant opportunities in the years ahead. And we continue to see significant opportunities for consumer, small and business banking franchise to be a more important source of growth. Let me give you just a few examples some of the things we're doing here. We continue to optimize and invest in our branch network. While our branch count declined 5% from a year ago, we are being more strategic about branch location strategy. We are accelerating our efforts to refurbish our branches, completing 296 during the first half of this year, and are on track to update all of our branches within the next five years. As part of our efforts to enhance the branch experience, we're also increasing our investment in our branch employees and improving technology, including a new digital account opening experience, which has been positive for both our bankers and our customers. We continue to have strong growth in mobile users with active mobile customers up 6% from a year ago. A year after launching Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant, we have had nearly 15 million users and over 117 million interactions. We expect this momentum to continue as we make further enhancements to offer our customers additional self-service features and value-added insights, including balanced trends and subscription spending. Looking ahead, overall, the U.S. economy remains strong, driven by a healthy labor market and solid growth. However, the economy is slowing and there are continued headwinds from still elevated inflation and elevated interest rates. As managers of a large complex financial institution, we think about both the risks and the opportunities and work to be prepared for the downside while continually building our ability to serve customers and clients. The actions we have taken to strengthen the Company have helped prepare us for a variety of economic environments, and while risks exist, we see significant opportunities in front of us. Our commitment and the progress we are making to build an appropriate operational and compliance risk management framework is foundational for our Company, and we will continue to prioritize and dedicate all necessary resources to complete our work. We have a diversified business model, see opportunities to build a broader earnings stream, and are seeing the early progress in our results. And we've maintained strong financial risk disciplines and a strong balance sheet. Operating with a strong capital position and - in anticipation of the uncertainty the stress test regime imposes on large banks and the potential for increases to our regulatory capital requirements resulting from Basel III finalization has served us well. It also allows us to serve our customers' financial needs and we remain committed to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 14% to $0.40 per share, subject to the approval by the Company's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. We repurchased over $12 billion of common stock during the first half of this year, and while the pace will slow, we have the capacity to continue repurchasing stock. I'm proud of the progress we continue to make and thankful to everyone who works at Wells Fargo. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was $4.9 billion, or $1.33 per diluted common share. EPS grew from both the first quarter and a year ago, reflecting the solid performance in our fee-based businesses as we benefited from the market environment and the investments we've been making. We also continue to focus on driving efficiency across the Company. I will also note that our second quarter effective income tax rate reflected the impact of the first quarter adoption of the new accounting standard for renewable energy tax credit investments, which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3 percentage points versus a year ago. This increase in the effective tax rate had a minimal impact on net income since it had an offsetting increase to non-interest income. Turning to Slide 4. As expected, non-interest income was down - net interest income was down $1.2 billion, or 9% from a year ago. This decline was driven by higher funding costs, including the impact of lower deposit balances and customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products in our consumer businesses and higher deposit costs in our commercial businesses as well as lower loan balances. This was partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. Net interest income declined $304 million, or 2% from the first quarter. Given the higher rate environment and neat commercial loan demand, loan balances continue to decline as expected. We saw positive trends, including average deposit balances growing from the first quarter with growth in all of our customer-facing businesses, including within our consumer business. Customer migration to higher-yielding alternatives was also lower in the quarter. This slowed the pace of growth in deposit pricing with our average deposit cost up 10 basis points in the second quarter after increasing 16 basis points in the first quarter. If the Fed were to start cutting rates later this year, we expect that deposit pricing will begin to decline with the most immediate impact from new promotional rates in our consumer business and standard pricing for commercial deposits where pricing moved faster as rates increased, and we would expect betas to also be higher as rates decline. On Slide 5, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both the first quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow while most other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average deposits were relatively stable from a year ago as growth in our commercial businesses and corporate funding offset declines in our consumer businesses, driven by customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives and continued consumer spending. Average deposits grew $4.9 billion in the first quarter. Commercial deposits have grown for three consecutive quarters as we've successfully attracted clients' operational deposits. After declining for nearly two years, consumer deposit balances grew modestly from the first quarter. We've seen outflows slow as many rate-seeking customers in Wealth and Investment Management have already moved into cash alternative products and we've successfully used promotion and retention-oriented strategies to retain and acquire new balances in consumer small and business banking. These improved deposit trends allowed us to reduce higher-cost market funding. The migration from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits was similar to last quarter with our percentage of non-interest-bearing deposits declining 26% in the first quarter to 25%. Turning to non-interest income on Slide 6. Non-interest income increased 19% from a year ago with growth across most categories, reflecting both the benefit of the investments we've been making in our businesses as well as the market conditions as Charlie highlighted. This growth more than offset the expected decline in net interest income with revenue increasing from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. I will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing our operating segment goals. Turning to expenses on Slide 7. Second quarter non-interest expense increased 2% from a year ago, driven by higher operating losses, an increase in revenue-related compensation, and higher technology and equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower salaries expense and professional and outside services expense. Operating losses increased from a year ago and included higher customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we're working hard to get behind us. The 7% decline in non-interest expense in the first quarter was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel expense in the first quarter. Turning to credit quality on Slide 8. Net loan charge-offs increased 7 basis points from the first quarter to 57 basis points of average loans. The increase was driven by higher commercial net loan charge-offs, which were up $127 million in the first quarter to 35 basis points of average loans, primarily reflecting higher losses in our commercial real-estate office portfolio. While losses in the commercial real-estate office portfolio increased in the second quarter after declining last quarter, they were in line with our expectations. As we have previously stated, commercial real estate office losses have been and will continue to be lumpy as we continue to work with clients. We continue to actively work to derisk our office exposure, including a rigorous monitoring process. These efforts help to reduce our office commitment by 13% and loan balances by 9% from a year ago. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased $25 million from the first quarter to 88 basis points of average loans. Auto losses continued to decline, benefiting from the credit-tightening actions we implemented starting in late 2021. The increase in credit card losses was in line with our expectations as older vintages are no longer benefiting from pandemic stimulus as more recent vintages - and as more recent vintages mature. Importantly, the credit performance of our newer vintages has been consistent with our expectations, and we currently expect the credit card charge-off rate to decline in the third quarter. Non-performing assets increased 5% from the first quarter, driven by the higher commercial real estate office non-accruals. Moving to Slide 9. Our allowance for credit losses was down modestly from the first quarter, driven by declines across most asset classes, partially offset by a higher allowance for credit card loans driven by higher balances. Our allowance coverage for total loans has been relatively stable over the past four quarters as credit trends remain generally consistent. Our allowance coverage for our commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately 11% for the past several quarters. Turning to capital liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong and our CET1 ratio 11% continue to be well above our current 8.9% regulatory minimum plus buffers. We're also above our expected new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8% starting in the fourth quarter of this year as our stressed capital buffer is expected to increase from 2.9% to 3.8%. We repurchased $6.1 billion of common stock in the second quarter, and while the pace will slow, we have the capacity to continue to repurchase common stock as Charlie highlighted. Also, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter by 14%, subject to Board approval. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Consumer, small and business banking revenue declined 5% from a year ago, driven by lower deposit balances and the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products. Home lending revenue was down 3% from a year ago due to lower net interest income as loan balances continued to decline. Credit card revenue was stable from a year ago as higher loan balances driven by higher point-of-sale volume and new account growth was offset by lower other fee revenue. Auto revenue declined 25% from last year, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. Personal lending revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 12. Retail mortgage originations declined 31% from a year ago, reflecting our focus on simplifying the home lending business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. Since we announced our new strategy at the start of 2023, we have reduced the headcount in home lending by approximately 45%. Balances in our auto portfolio declined 14% compared with a year ago, driven by lower origination volumes, which were down 23% from a year ago, reflecting previous credit tightening actions. Both debit and credit card spend increased from a year ago. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue was down 2% from a year ago driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury management fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 17% year-over-year, including lower net interest income, lower lease income, and revenue from equity investments. Average loan balances were down 1% compared with a year ago. Loan demand has remained tepid, reflecting the higher for longer rate environment in a market where competition has been more aggressive on pricing and loan structure. Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 3% from a year ago, driven by higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products, partially offset by lower treasury management results driven by the impact of higher interest rates on deposit accounts. Commercial real estate revenue was down 4% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances. Markets revenue grew 16% from a year ago, driven by strong performance in equities, structured products and credit products. Average loans declined 5% from a year ago as growth in markets was more than offset by reductions in commercial real estate, where originations remain muted and we've strategically reduced balances in our office portfolio as well as declines in banking where clients continue to access capital goods funding. On Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 6% compared with a year ago. Higher asset-based fees driven by an increase in market valuations were partially offset by lower net interest income, reflecting lower deposit balances and higher deposit costs as customers reallocated cash into higher-yielding alternatives. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning in the quarter, so third quarter results will reflect market valuations as of July 1st, which were up from both a year ago and from April 1st. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results from our venture capital investments. Turning to our 2024 outlook for net interest income and non-interest expense on Slide 17. At the beginning of the year, we expected 2024 net interest income to be approximately 7% to 9% lower than full-year 2023. During the first half of this year, the drivers of net interest income largely played out as expected with net interest income down 9% from the same period a year ago. Compared with where we began the year, our current outlook reflects the benefit of fewer rate cuts as well as higher deposit balances in our businesses than what we had assumed in our original expectations, which has helped us reduce market funding. Deposit costs increased during the first half of this year as expected, but the pace of the increase has slowed. However, late in the second quarter, we increased pricing in Wealth and Investment Management on sweep deposits and advisory brokerage accounts. This change was not anticipated in our original guidance, federal lines rates paid-in money market funds and is expected to reduce net interest income by approximately $350 million this year. Our current outlook also reflects lower loan balances. At the beginning of the year, we assumed a slight decline in average loans for the full year, which reflected modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year. As we highlighted on our first quarter earnings call, loan balances were weaker than expected and that trend continued into the second quarter. We expect this underperformance to continue into the second half of the year with loan balances declining slightly from second quarter levels. As a result of these factors, we currently expect our full-year 2024 net interest income to be in the upper half of the range we provided in January, or down approximately 89% from full-year 2023. We continue to expect net interest income will trough towards the end of the year. We are only halfway through the year and many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain, and we will continue to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year. Turning to expenses. At the beginning of this year, we expected our full-year 2024 non-interest expense to be approximately $52.6 billion. We currently expect our full-year 2024 non-interest expense to be approximately $54 billion. There are three primary drivers for this increase. First, the equity markets have outperformed our expectations, driving higher revenue-related compensation expense in Wealth and Investment Management. As a reminder, this is a good thing as these higher expenses are more than offset by higher non-interest income. Second, operating losses and the other customer remediation-related expenses have been higher during the first half of the year than we expected. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year. Finally, we did not anticipate the $336 million of expense in the first half of the year for the FDIC special assessment, which is now included in our updated guidance. We'll continue to update you as the year progresses. In summary, our results in the second quarter reflected the progress we're making to transform Wells Fargo and improve our financial performance. Our strong growth in fee-based businesses offset the expected decline in net interest income. We made further progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our capital position remains strong, enabling us to return excess capital to shareholders, and we continue to make progress on our path to a sustainable ROTCE of 15%. We will now take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Mike, I wonder if you could provide a little bit more detail on those latter points you made on the changes on the deposit cost side. First of all, I guess relative to the 12 basis points that you saw in terms of interest-bearing cost increase, which was lower than the 17%, how do you just generally expect that to look going forward? And how - and is that sweep pricing also a part of what that number will look like going forward? Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Thanks, Ken. Yes, I mean the sweep pricing will be included in that going forward about - you saw about a - basically about a month's worth in the quarter. We made the change in June so you saw about a third of a quarterly impact already included in the number. Look, I think when you drill into what's going on in the deposit side, I'd say a few things. One, the overall - you know, we're not seeing a lot of pressure on overall pricing in deposits. On the consumer side, this migration that's been happening now for a while from checking into savings or CDs is still happening, but at a slower pace. And you can see that over the last couple of years as it's been pretty stable the last quarter or two, but it's definitely slowing as you look at the quarter. And so I'd anticipate you'd still see more migration, but continuing to slow as we look as we look forward. On the wholesale side, we - the pricing has been pretty competitive now for a while and that's the case. And so we've been pleased to see that we're able to grow good operational deposits. And so given the competitive pricing there, that puts a little near-term pressure on NII, but those deposits are going to be very valuable over a long period of time, particularly as rates start to come back down. And so the positive, I think overall is you saw deposits grow in every line of business for the first time in a long time, and that migration is slowing to higher-yielding alternatives. And so we'll see how it plays out for the rest of the year, but I think there's some good positive trends that are emerging there. Ken Usdin : Great. Thank you. And just a follow-up. The fees were really good and the trading business continues to demonstrate that it's taking market share. I guess how do we understand how to kind of measure that going forward, right, versus what the Group is doing? You guys are definitely, zigging and outperforming there. And where do you think you are in terms of market-share gains, and how sustainable do you think this new kind of run-rate of trading is going forward? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No, I'll take that and Charlie can chime in if he wants. As you look at trading at any given quarter, it's going to bounce around, right? So you can't necessarily straight-line any single quarter. So I'll be careful there as you look forward. But I think the good part is like we've been methodically sort of making investments in really all the asset classes, FX, credit, lesser degree in equities and other places, but we're getting the benefit of those investments each quarter on an incremental basis. I think that business is still constrained by the asset cap. And so we are not growing assets or financing clients' assets at the same level we would be if we didn't have the asset cap, which also then drives more trading flow as we go. And so I'd say we're still methodically sort of building it out and there should be opportunity for us to grow that in a prudent way for a while. But any given quarter may bounce around a little bit depending on what's happening in the market or an asset class. And we're getting good reception from clients as we engage with them more and see them move more flow to us. Charlie Scharf : And this is Charlie. Let me just add a couple of things, which is, you know, as we think about the things that we're doing to invest in our banking franchise, both markets and the investment banking side of the franchise, it's not risk-based. It's actually - it's focused on customer flows on the trading side, it's focused on expanding coverage and improving product capabilities on the banking side. So what we look at - and we're also very, very focused on returns overall, as you can imagine, as all the other large financial institutions are. So as we're looking at our progress, we do look at share across all the different categories and would expect to see those to continue to tick up. And so as you look through the volatility that exists in the marketplace, we are looking at a sustained level of growth, recognizing that we don't control the quarter-to-quarter volatility. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir. John Pancari : Good morning. You expressed confidence that NII should bottom towards the year-end or towards the back half of this year. Maybe you could just give us what gives you the confidence in maintaining that view just given the loan growth dynamics that you mentioned and you just mentioned the funding cost and the rate backdrop. If you could just kind of walk us through your confidence around inflection and I guess what it could mean as you go into 2025. Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. We won't talk much about 2025, John, but as you sort of look at what's happening, you're seeing this pace of migration on the deposit side flow, as I mentioned earlier. So you're seeing more stability as time goes by there. Once the Fed starts lowering rates, which the market expects to happen later in the year, you'll start to see betas on the way down on the wholesale side of the deposit base. You'll continue to see some gradual sort of repricing on the asset side as you see more securities and more loans sort of roll. And so you got to look exactly calling sort of the trough is which quarter it's going to be. Sometimes can be a little tough, but as you sort of look at all the components of it, we still feel pretty good about being able to see that happen over the coming few quarters. John Pancari : Okay. Thanks, Mike. And if I just hop over to capital buybacks, I mean, you bought back about $6.1 billion this quarter similar to the first quarter. You indicated the pace will slow. Maybe you could give us a little bit of color on how we should think about that moderation, and how long that could persist at this point and how long until you could be back at the run rate you were previously? Charlie Scharf : Yes, let me take a shot at it, Mike, and then you can add the color on this one. Listen, I think when you look at where we've been running capital, we've been trying to anticipate, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the uncertainties that exist around the way we find out about SEB, as well as the uncertainty that exists with where Basel III ultimately comes out. The reality of those two things are we know where the SEB is for this year at this point. We still don't know where Basel III ultimately winds up. So I think as we sit here today, we will continue - we'll be conservative on capital return in the shorter term until we learn more about exactly where Basel III will ultimately wind up, and then we can get more specific about what that means for capital return. So I think we're just trying to be very pragmatic. The reality is we're still generating a significant amount of capital and a reasonably sized dividend that's increased as our earnings power has increased. Given the fact that we have constraints, it is most of what the remainder of our capital generation goes towards capital return, but we want to see where Basel III ultimately winds up. John Pancari : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi, good morning. Just maybe one follow-up first, Mike and Charlie on capital. Is 11% in-line in the sand right now as you wait for Basel and clarity there, as we - at least you're not guiding for it, but as we think about what the pace of buybacks might be, or could CET1 go below 11% still significant buffer over the 9.6% minimum? I would appreciate how you think about that ratio in the context of capital return. Charlie Scharf : I think where we are plus a little bit, probably not minus a little bit, but plus some is probably the right place to be at this point. Remember, the SEB was higher than we expected, and so that's factoring into our thinking. And so that's really what's driving our thinking in terms of slowing the pace of buybacks at this point. But again, hopefully, we'll get some more clarity on Basel III. We know what you know and then we'll be much clearer about what we think the future looks like there. But again, overall, we still have the capacity to buy back. We just as we've always been, we want to be prudent. Ebrahim Poonawala : Understood. And then just moving to expenses. So I get the expense guide increase, but remind us, has anything changed maybe, Charlie, from you first on the expense flex that's a big part of the wealth thesis around efficiency gains, which should lead to the path for that 15% ROTCE? And what are you baking in, in terms of the fee revenue for the back half as part of that guide like does it assume elevated levels of trading in IBA? Thank you. Charlie Scharf : So let me just take the first part. So just - and I appreciate you asking the question. I think, as far - from where - as we look forward, nothing has changed for us as we think about the opportunity to continue to become more efficient. That story is no different today than it was yesterday or last quarter. As we increased the estimates for the year, it's really reflective of three broad categories. One are the variable expenses that relate to our Wealth and Investment Management business where we have higher revenues that results in higher payout. And as Mike always points out, that's actually a good thing, even though it's embedded in the expense line, which causes that number to head upwards. The second thing are the fact that we've had higher customer remediations and FDIC expenses in the first half of the year, than when we contemplated the expense guidance. On the customer remediations, we've said it's - they're not new items. They're historical items. We're getting closer to the end of finalization in these things. And as that occurs, things like response rates and making sure that we've identified every - the full amount of the population gets all fine-tuned and that's what's flowing through. But that's a - it really rates to historical matters and not something that's embedded in what we see in the business going forward. So what you're left with is the rest of the earnings, I'm sorry, the expense base of the Company and it's playing out as we would have expected. And so as we sit here and look forward, all the statements I've made in the past are still true, which is we're not as efficient as we need to be. We're focused on investing in growing the business. We're focused on spending what's necessary to build the right risk and control infrastructure and we're focused on driving efficiency out of the Company and that lever is as continues to be exactly what it's been. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And you assume fees staying elevated in the back half as part of the guidance? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I assume equity markets are about where they are today, yes, it's still staying pretty elevated. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. First, I just want to put context to this question, because I didn't want to ask it just in isolation because it seems ticky-tacky, but it's not. So the stock is down 7.5%, and if I just take consensus to the higher end of your NII range to 9%, that would imply that consensus would adjust 3.5% in isolation. So this is just a context of why I'm asking this question on expenses. So your expenses went up in terms of from your original guide, $1.4 billion. I guess and you laid out those three bullets and you quantified FDIC special assessment. I guess, I'm just wondering, if you could give us a little bit more detail on how much more of the remediation expenses and op losses were up versus your original expectation because I think what the market wants to understand is, PP - you know, NII, okay, we get it, that's happening because of deposit repricing. But is core - you know, are the - is core PPNR outside of that in turn going up, right? Just sort of want to have that assurance in terms of is the EPS going to be down as much coming out of this as the market is indicating. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No, Erika. It's Mike. I appreciate the question. We give you the operating loss line in the supplement so you can see that. And if you - based on what we had said in January, if you assume that the $1.3 billion on a full-year basis was just split evenly across all the quarters, you can see that the operating losses are up about $500 million year-to-date over that run-rate. So that's the way to think about approximately what the impact of that is year-to-date in the first half. Charlie Scharf : So then you take that, you add the FDIC to it. Mike Santomassimo : Right. And the remainder is roughly the revenue-related expenses in wealth management. Charlie Scharf : So that's why, Erika, when I was talking before, when you look at what's driving the increase in the expense guide, it is remediations in the first and second quarters. It's the FDIC expense that you've seen, and it's the increase in variable expenses. Everything else is playing out as we would have expected. Erika Najarian : Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And just maybe some comments on how you're thinking about credit quality from here. It looks like you continue to release reserves in the second quarter. Is this a message that you feel like you've captured most of the CRE-related issues, of course, absent of a further deterioration in the economy, and how should we think about the trajectory of the reserves from here relative to your charge-offs? Charlie Scharf : Well, when you say - well, I think when we look at the reserves, you have to bucket into different pieces. Our exposures are coming down in parts of the consumer business. And our - based on underwriting changes we've made, it's not just balances, but also the actual losses. So that's what's driving the reductions in that part of the loss reserves on the consumer side. And on the credit card side, it's really driven - the increase is really driven by balances. So you've got two very different dynamics going on there with the releases being just representative of a smaller higher credit quality credit portfolio. And then on the wholesale side, what we - the losses that we've seen and the credit performance in our CIB office CRE portfolio is playing out no worse than we would have expected when we set our ACL, but there's still uncertainty there so we're maintaining the coverage. So overall, there's really - in terms of our expectations, no real change from what we're seeing in the CRE portfolio, which is where the lost content is actually coming through. And elsewhere, things are still fairly benign other than some episodic credit events in part of the wholesale business, but no real trend there. Erika Najarian : Great. Thank you, Charlie and Mike. Operator : The next question will come from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Can you just elaborate a bit on why you increased the deposit costs for wealth? Was it to keep up with the competition? Was it trying to get ahead of some potential pricing pressures? Or what was kind of the logic there? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Hi, it's Mike, Matt. So this was very specific to a sweep product in the wealth business. So it's a portion of that overall deposit, and it doesn't have any bearing on any other products. So I would just leave that very specific to that one individual product in fiduciary accounts or advisory accounts. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And how big is that - those deposit balances? Mike Santomassimo : We didn't - we don't - that's not something we normally have out there. But you can see the impact is, - I sort of highlighted the impact is roughly $350 million for the rest of the year - for the second half of the year. And - so I would just use that as - and that's already embedded in sort of the guidance we gave. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just a separate topic here. I mean, the credit card growth has been very good. You highlighted rolling out some new products. And the question as always, when you - anybody growth kind of so much in a certain category, you mentioned not growing too quickly, the loss rates have gone up maybe a little more than some peers, not as much as some others, obviously in line with what you were targeting. There was that negative Wall Street Journal article on one of your cards. So just kind of taken together, what kind of checks and balances you have to make sure that a somewhat new initiative for you that you're growing at the right pace? Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Yes. So, Mike, why don't I'll start, and then you can chime in? So first of all, we - when we look at our credit card performance, we do not look at it in total, right? We look at each individual product. We look at all of the performance broken out by vintage, and we compare the results that we're seeing, both in terms of balance build as well as credit performance, not losses, but starting very early with early-on book's delinquencies, and we look at how they're playing out versus pre-pandemic results as well as what we would have anticipated when we launched the product. As I've said, we look at the actual quality of the consumers that we're underwriting and the overall credit quality. We haven't compromised credit quality at all. We've probably tightened up a little bit as time has gone on relative to where we had been, but the actual performance when you look at the vintages is it's really spot-on with what we would have expected. So what you're seeing in terms of the increase in loss rates is just the maturing of the portfolio. And the last thing I'll just say is just when you think about the Wall Street Journal article, you know, that - we've launched a lot - a bunch of new credit cards. That is a - relative to the size and the scope of all of the cards that we issue and what our strategy is, that's a very, very, very small piece of it. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And I would just add one piece. As you look at new account growth, we're not originating anything less than 660. So, as Charlie mentioned, some of the credit tightening with 660 FICO, sorry. So as Charlie mentioned, the credit box has not been brought in really at all. And when you look at some of the bigger products like cashback, like the cashback card, active cash, the new originations are coming in at a higher credit quality than the back-book was. And so at this point, as Charlie said, we go through it at a very, very granular level each quarter and the results are kind of right where we expect. And if we start to see any kind of weakness at all, we're adjusting where needed. Charlie Scharf : And just one last comment here, which is, again, because I appreciate the question. Whenever it's - you know, whenever you see a lot of growth in a product that has risk in it, it's always the right thing to ask the questions. We're not - this isn't - the people that are doing this, both in our card business, club who runs consumer lending myself like it. This is not a new product for us. We've seen this happen in the past. We've seen people do this well and we've seen people not do this well. And so we're very, very conscious of the risks that you're pointing out as we go forward, just as we are on the other businesses that we're investing in. Matt O'Connor: Okay, that's helpful. And obviously, you talked about card losses going down in 3Q, so that's consistent with everything that you said as well. So thank you for the color. Charlie Scharf : Yes, absolutely. Operator : The next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Charlie Scharf : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : So just wanted to make sure on the expense guide I get the point that a bunch of that is related to better revenues from wealth management. And so your - we should be anticipating as a part of that, that revenues for wealth management in the second half is going to be at least at one-half or maybe even a little higher. Is that fair? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I mean, I - Betsy, I covered that in my script too. So as you look at the advisory assets there, they get price-based on - and most of them get priced in advance for the quarter. So you know what third quarter looks like based on where we are now. And obviously, it's not all equity market. There's some fixed income in there as well. But you should see a little bit of an increase as you go into the third quarter based on where the markets are now and then we'll see what the fourth quarter looks like when we get there. Betsy Graseck : Yes, okay. So I just wanted to make sure we balanced out the expenses with the rev. So I know you're not guiding revs up, but interpretation leads you down that path. And so then I guess the other piece of the question I had just had to relate with the loan balance discussion that was going on earlier, and what's your view of interest in leaning into the markets business today? I realize there is opportunity, there's still the asset cap constraint, but you're not at the asset cap. So there is room for you to lean in. There are players who are a little bit more constrained on capital than you even in that space. So is this an area that you would be interested in leaning into, especially when C&I and CRE and other types of loans are low demand right now as you indicated earlier? Thanks. Charlie Scharf : Well, let me start. I think - so first of all, relative to where the balance sheet is running, we're not - let me say, we want to - we're careful about how we run the overall balance sheet, right, which is we don't want to operate at the cap on a regular basis because you've got to be prepared both for a customer appetite in terms of lending and deposits when you see it, as well as we lived through COVID where there was an event and all of a sudden there were a bunch of draws and we have to live within that asset gap. So running it with a cushion is a very smart thing we think for us to do, even though you can argue we're giving up some shorter-term profit. So that's just the reality of where we live. And so as we think about the markets business and what that means, yes, in the perfect world, we - you know, we're allowing them to finance some more. There are more opportunities out there for us to be able to do that. But what we are doing is, as we think about inside the Company optimizing the balance sheet and where we get the most returns and where there is more demand and less demand, there has been less demand in other parts of the Company and there's been more demand on the trading side. So our assets are actually up 15%-ish. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, trading. If you go to the supplement, that's the trading assets on an average basis are up 17%, a little more on a spot basis. Charlie Scharf : So we're just trying to - so we're reflective of what those opportunities are but we've got to keep capacity for the reasons I mentioned. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Charlie Scharf : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : And Charlie, you mentioned in your opening comments about Fargo - you guys launched Fargo over a year ago, I guess, and you're having real good pickup. Can you share with us any other AI-orientated programs that are in work in progress right now that could lead to increased efficiencies, or cost savings, or even revenue enhancements as you go forward? Charlie Scharf : Sure. Yes. As we - first of all, when we think about AI, we do break it into different categories, right? There is traditional AI and then there is GenAI. We have a huge number of use cases already embedded across the Company with just traditional AI. And that is - it's in - it's in our - it's in marketing. It's in credit decision-ing. It's in information that we provide bankers on both the wholesale on the consumer side about what customers could be willing or might be willing to entertain a discussion about. And so that is - in a lot of respects, that's business-as-usual for us. The new opportunity that exists with GenAI is where AI creates something based upon whether it's public data on our own data in terms of things that haven't existed. We are most focused in the shorter term on things that can drive efficiency, but it also contributes to just quality of the experience for our customers. So great examples of things like that are call centers. We take a lots of phone calls and we've got lots of opportunities through AI to answer those questions before someone gets to a call center rep. But once they get to a call center rep, we put a lot of effort into answering that question correctly, but also making sure that we're capturing that information, understanding root cause across all these calls we get. That means bankers have to go - telephone bankers have to go in, actually enter what the call was about, what they think the root cause is. We then have to aggregate that and so on and so forth. Through GenAI, that can be done automatically. It could be done immediately and the work can be done for us to identify that root cause, so then we can go back, look at it, make sure that's the case and make the change. So ultimately, that results in, fixing defects going forward, but it also takes so much manual effort out of what we do. And so that's - and so any place where something is written, something is analyzed by an individual, we've got the opportunity to automate that. Those things exist on the wholesale side as well as the consumer side. And to the extent that they impact a consumer, we're going to move very slowly to make sure we understand the impact of that. And so the work is a meaningful part of as we think about prioritization in terms of our tech spend. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. I appreciate those insights. And then just as a quick follow-up. You also mentioned about improved adviser retention in the quarter. And when you look at your Wealth and Investment Management segment, I recognize commissions and brokerage service fees are not the main driver, and investment advisory and other asset-based fees are in revenues for this division. But I noticed that they've been flat-to-down this year, they were up over a year ago. Is it seasonal in the second quarter that, that line of business just gets softer? Or is it the higher-rate environment where customers are just leaving more cash in - more assets in cash because they're getting 5% or so? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. There really is no rhyme or reason necessarily, Gerard, to exactly how that moves one quarter to the next necessarily. And obviously, if there's like large balance of volatility, you might see more transaction activity. That certainly hasn't been the case necessarily in the equity market in the second quarter. But to some degree, as that line item - over a very long period of time, that line item probably declines more and advisory goes up. And that's actually a really good thing from a productivity and from an ongoing revenue perspective as well. Gerard Cassidy : Yes. Okay, super. Okay, appreciate it. Thank you, Mike. Operator : And our final question for today will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir. Steven Chubak : Thanks, and good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Just given the sheer amount of, I guess, investor questions that we've received on the deposit pricing changes in wealth, I was hoping you could provide some additional context given many of your peers have talked about cash sorting pressures abating, or at least being in the very late innings. And want to better understand what informed the decision to adjust your pricing? Was it impacting advisor recruitment, or retention? Was it impeding your ability to retain more share of wallet? And - or is this an effort to maybe go on the offensive and lead the market on pricing and sweep deposits and force others to potentially follow suit? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, Steve. It's Mike. I'd say just a couple of things. One, this is not in reaction to cash sorting. We are seeing cash sorting slow in the Wealth business, just like we're seeing that in the consumer business. So this is not a reaction to that in any way. It's a relatively small portion of the overall deposits that sit within the - in the Wealth business, and it is very specific to this product, which is in an advisory account where there's frictional cash there. So it's not a reaction to competitive forces that we're seeing or us trying to be proactive somewhere to drive growth. Steven Chubak : Understood. And just one follow-up on the discussion relating to expenses. And just given the fee momentum that you're seeing within CIB and Wealth, and you're clearly making investments in both of those segments, at the same time, the incremental margins have actually been quite high, especially in CIB where it's running north of 75% on just first-half this year versus last. I was hoping to get some perspective as we think about some of that fee momentum being sustained, what do you believe are sustainable or durable incremental margins within CIB and Wealth recognizing the payout profiles are different? Mike Santomassimo : Well, let me start on the Wealth side and I'll come back to the I-banking or banking side. So on the Wealth side, what's really going to help us drive a margin expansion in that business over time are really kind of two things. One is continued productivity and growth in the advisory asset side, which you can see happening, and then two, and we've talked about this in other forums. It's doing a much better job penetrating that client base with banking and lending products. When you look at our loans in the Wealth business and you look at the overall asset base or the advisor for us, we're much less penetrated than some of the peers. And so I think those things really help drive us to get to more best-in-class margins, which are higher than where we sit today. And that takes some time on the lending side. In this rate environment, it's a little harder to drive that growth. And as rates start to come down, you'll probably see more demand there. And so there are some cyclical aspects of it that sort of come to from a timing perspective. But those are things that the - you know, Barry Sommers and the whole management team in Wealth are very focused on and making sure we've got the right capabilities, the right sales force, the right support for the sales force and so forth. On the I-banking side, we've been making investments in that business now for the better part of two-plus years, a little longer than that probably. And as we're adding good people, we're also not necessarily - we're also making sure that we've got the right people in the right seats. And so you're not seeing this really huge increase in overall senior headcount, you're actually - we're making sure we have the right people in the right seats, and so you've seen some reductions as you've seen some growth. And so that's helping also moderate the overall investment. And then also, as we brought those people on, you're paying them full freight when you recruit people, right? So what you're seeing is you're getting the benefit of those investments by adding the revenue piece now, but you've already got the expense in the run-rate to some degree. And so I think you'll see that pace of margin expansion moderate over time, but what you're seeing is what you should expect, which is like we made the investments, you're paying the people, now they're becoming productive incrementally each quarter and that's good to see. Steven Chubak : That's a really helpful color, Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Charlie Scharf : All right, everyone. Thanks very much. We'll talk to you soon. Operator : Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call. At this time, all parties may disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference. John Campbell : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today, where our CEO, Charlie Scharf, and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K file today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some third quarter highlights. Our results were solid with $5.1 billion net income, diluted earnings per share of $1.42, an ROE of 11.7%, and an ROTCE of 13.9%. All were up from the second quarter. Our earnings profile is very different than it was five years ago, as we've been making strategic investments in many of our businesses and de-emphasizing or selling others. Our revenue sources are more diverse and our fee-based revenue has grown 16% during the first nine months of the year, largely offsetting the net interest income headwinds we have faced over the last year. We have maintained strong credit discipline and driven significant operating efficiencies in the company while investing heavily to build a risk and control infrastructure appropriate for a bank of our size and complexity. Headcount has declined every quarter for four years and was down 20% since the third quarter of 2020. Our expenses in the third quarter were down from both the second quarter and a year ago. Average loans declined from the second quarter as we've maintained strong credit standards and our focus on returns over volume. We've continued to grow our credit card portfolio with balances growing for 13 consecutive quarters and commercial loan demand remains weak, reflecting economic uncertainty and the expectation that rates will be lower in the future. Overall deposits declined slightly from the second quarter, but deposit balances and our customer facing businesses continue to grow, which has enabled us to reduce higher cost treasury, corporate treasury deposits. We've started to reduce deposit pricing in response to the recent Fed rate cuts and we're closely monitoring market conditions and will continue to make adjustments. Both our consumer and commercial customers have remained resilient. In our wholesale businesses, credit performance improved from the second quarter, with lower losses in both our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loan portfolios. The office market remains weak, and we continue to expect additional charge-offs in our commercial real estate office portfolio and have accordingly maintained strong allowance coverage. Overall, customers in our consumer businesses continue to hold up relatively well, benefiting from a strong labor market and wage growth. Consumer charge-offs declined from the second quarter, driven by lower losses in our credit card portfolio, while our other consumer portfolios continue to perform well, reflecting the benefit of prior credit tightening actions. We continue to look for changes in consumer health, but we have not seen meaningful changes in trends when looking at delinquency statistics across our consumer credit portfolios. Both credit card and debit card spend were up in the third quarter from a year ago. And although the pace of growth has slowed, it is still healthy. We continue to see more pronounced stress in certain customer segments with lower deposit and asset levels, where inflation has partially offset strong employment and wage growth. The benefits of inflation slowing and interest rates starting to ease should be helpful to all customers but especially those on the lower end of the income scale. Our capital position remains strong with our CET1 ratio of 11.3% up from 11% last quarter. And we continue to return significant amounts of excess capital to shareholders. We repurchased $3.5 billion common stock in the quarter and $15.6 billion of common stock during the first three quarters of this year, up over 60% from a year ago. And we increased our common stock dividend in the third quarter by 14%. Shareholders have meaningfully benefited from our capital management actions as our earnings per share are up over 50% since the third quarter of 2019, benefiting from the 22% decline in diluted average common shares over the same period. Now let me update you on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work, which remains our top priority. We continue to move forward with confidence and believe we have the right culture, team, discipline, and sense of urgency to complete the work that's required. That includes what is required under the recent formal agreement we entered with the Office -- of the Control of the Currency. We are also continuing to execute our other strategic priorities. We continue to build our credit card business and this past quarter, we launched two new co-branded credit cards with Expedia, which provide our customers a unique travel rewards program with instant discounts, enhanced perks and accelerated rewards. Our broader set of credit card products continue to be well received by both existing customers and customers new to Wells Fargo with nearly 2 million new credit cards accounts this year. Last month, we announced a multi-year co-branded agreement with Volkswagen Financial Services. Starting in the first half of next year, we will be the preferred purchase financing provider for Volkswagen and Audi brands in the United States. The investments we've been making in our consumer, small and business banking segment are starting to generate growth. After several years of no growth, net checking counts have now grown for three consecutive quarters. And we believe our debit card share has started to increase as well. Mobile active users increased by 1.6 million or 5% from last year. We are also investing in our branches and have refurbished over 460 branches during the first three quarters of this year. We continued to hire proven leaders in our corporate investment bank. In investment banking, we made several important hires, focused on key coverage and product groups to help us build on our momentum and grow the business. We also hired a new Vice Chair of corporate banking who is focused on helping us continue to expand and grow that franchise. We also continue to attract experienced leaders in other areas. And in the third quarter, Bridget Engle joined Wells Fargo as Head of Technology reporting to me. I've worked with Bridget in the past and know firsthand [how her] (ph) deep experience leading large-scale technology transformations at large global financial institutions will benefit Wells Fargo. Our strategic priorities also include focusing on businesses that are core to our consumer and corporate clients, and when they aren't, shrinking or selling them. As part of this effort, during the third quarter, we announced we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell the non-agency third party servicing segment of our commercial mortgage servicing business. We will continue servicing agency loans and loans held on our balance sheet. Looking ahead, overall the US economy remains strong with inflation slowing and a resilient labor market boosting income and supporting consumer spending. Company balance sheets are strong, contributing to both consumption and investment in the economy, but slowing demand for commercial lending. We continue to be prepared for a variety of economic environments, and we'll balance our desire to increase returns and grow while protecting the downside. We have one of the most enviable franchises of the industry and a top management team capable of delivering strong results. I want to thank everyone who I work with at Wells Fargo for everything they've done to transform this great company. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the results in the third quarter. We again saw good growth in non-interest income across most businesses and expenses were well controlled. Net income for the third quarter was $5.1 billion or $1.42 per diluted common share. During the quarter, we took the opportunity to reposition a portion of the investment securities portfolio. Our results included $447 million or $0.10 per share of net losses on the sale of debt securities. This included the sale of approximately $16 billion of securities and reinvestment of the proceeds into securities with yields approximately 130 basis points higher than the securities we sold. The estimated earn-back period for this repositioning is a little over two years. Without the impact of the investment securities portfolio repositioning earnings per share would have been $1.52. When looking at our results compared with a year ago, I'd remind you that our third quarter results last year included $349 million or $0.09 cents per share of discrete tax benefits. Turning to Slide 4, net interest income declined $233 million or 2% from the second quarter. $128 million of this decline was due to the increased pricing on sweep deposits and advisory brokerage accounts and wealth and investment management that we highlighted on last quarter's call. This was the lowest linked-quarter decline in net interest income since third quarter 2023, as customer migration to higher yielding deposit products continued to slow and the pace of deposit pricing increases also decelerated. Deposit costs were up 7 basis points in the third quarter with approximately half of this increase driven by the pricing increase on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts. The third quarter increase in deposit costs was lower than the 10 basis point increase in the second quarter and the 16 basis point rise in the first quarter. In response to the Federal Reserve rate cut in September, we have reduced rates on promotional deposit offers in our consumer businesses. Pricing on sweep deposits and advisory brokerage accounts, which are aligned to money market funds, will continue to move in-line with Fed rate cuts. Commercial deposit pricing is responding quickly to Federal Reserve rate reductions, just as it did when rates were rising. We are continuously monitoring competitive conditions and deposit trends and will adjust pricing, tenor, and new balance requirements based on our observations. We highlight loans and deposits on Slide 5. Average loans were down from both the second quarter and a year ago with continued growth in credit card loan balances more than offset by declines in most other categories. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average deposits increased $1.4 billion from a year ago and growth in our customer deposits enabled us to reduce higher cost corporate treasury deposits. Average deposits were down $4.8 billion in the second quarter. This decline was driven by an $18.5 billion reduction in higher-cost corporate treasury deposits, while customer deposits grew $13.7 billion from the second quarter. All else equal, a reduction in corporate treasury deposits is a positive for net interest income in the current environment. Turning to non-interest income on Slide 6. We had strong growth in non-interest income up 12% from a year ago. As Charlie highlighted, this growth reflects the benefits of the investments we've been making in our businesses as well as market conditions. We grew non-interest income across most categories, including double-digit increases year-over-year in many of our largest fee-generating activities, including investment advisory, net gains from trading activities, deposit-related fees and investment banking. We also benefited from improved results in our venture capital investments. I will highlight the specific drivers of non-interest income growth when discussing our operating segment results. Turning to expenses on Slide 7. Non-interest expense declined from both the second quarter and a year ago. The impact of our efficiency initiatives helps reduce salaries and professional and outside services expense compared with a year ago. These declines were partially offset by higher revenue-related compensation, predominantly in Wealth and Investment Management as well as higher technology and equipment expense. Operating losses declined from a year ago and from the higher levels we had in the first half of this year. Turning to credit quality on Slide 8. Net loan charge-offs decreased 8 basis points from the second quarter to 49 basis points of average loans. The decline was driven by lower commercial net loan charge-offs, which were down $145 million from the second quarter to 24 basis points of average loans with lower losses in both our commercial real estate and commercial and industrial portfolios. While losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio declined in the third quarter, market fundamentals remained weak, and we still expect commercial real estate office losses to be lumpy, as we continue to actively work with our clients. Consumer net loan charge-offs declined $45 million from the second quarter to 83 basis points of average loans, driven by lower losses in the credit card portfolio. Non-performing assets decreased 3% in the second quarter driven by lower commercial real estate non-accrual loans. Commercial real estate office non-accruals declined $164 million, which included paydowns and net loan charge-offs. Moving to Slide 9. Our allowance for credit losses for loans was down $50 million from the second quarter with modest declines across most asset classes, largely offset by an increase in allowance for credit card loans driven by higher balances. Our allowance coverage for loans has been relatively stable over the past year, as credit trends remain within our expectations. Our allowance coverage for our corporate and investment banking and commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately 11% since third quarter of 2023. Turning to capital liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11.3% continued to be well above our new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8%, which became effective in the fourth quarter. The increase in our CET1 ratio from the second quarter included a benefit of 28 basis points from higher accumulated other comprehensive income, due to lower interest rates and tighter mortgage-backed security spreads. With the $3.5 billion of common stock repurchased in the third quarter, our share repurchases during the first three quarters of this year were $6 billion higher than the same period a year ago, and diluted average shares outstanding declined 7% from a year ago. Turning to our operating segment results, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Consumer Small and Business Banking revenue declined 5% from a year ago, driven by lower deposit balances and the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products. However, the pace of migration continued to slow. The slight increase in Home Lending revenue from a year ago was driven by higher mortgage banking fees. Credit Card revenue declined 2% from a year ago, as lower fee revenue more than offset higher net interest income. Auto revenue decreased 24% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. The decline in personal lending revenue from a year ago was also driven by lower loan balances and loans spread compression. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 12. Retail mortgage originations declined 14% from a year ago, reflecting the progress we've made on simplifying the Home Lending business but grew 4% from the second quarter. We also continue to make progress on reducing the size of our servicing business. The amount of third-party mortgage loan service was down 16% from a year ago. Since we announced our new strategy early last year, we reduced headcount in Home Lending by 46%. The size of our Auto portfolio continued to decline with period-end loan balances down 14% from a year ago, driven by previous credit tightening actions. Origination volume in the third quarter was stable year-over-year and grew 11% from the second quarter. Debit card spending increased $2.3 billion or 2% from a year ago, and credit card spending was up 10% from a year ago with growth in all categories except fuel. Payment rates were modestly lower than a year ago, but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue was down 1% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, reflecting higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury management fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income and lease income, partially offset by improved results from our -- from equity investments. Average loan balances in the third quarter were down 1% compared with a year ago. Loan demand remained weak, as many clients remain cautious about investing in inventory buildup and capital expenditures due to economic uncertainty, high borrowing costs. Turning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue was down 5% from a year ago, driven by higher deposit costs and lower loan balances. Commercial real estate revenue decreased 1% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances, partially offset by higher capital markets revenue. Markets revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by strong performance in rates, structured products and municipals, partially offset by lower revenue and equities. Average loans declined 6% from a year ago, driven by continued reductions in our commercial real estate portfolio and lower loan balances and banking as clients continue to access capital markets funding. On Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 5% compared with a year ago, due to higher asset based fees driven by increased market valuations, as well as higher brokerage transaction activity, partially offset by lower net interest income, driven by the increased pricing on sweep deposits in advisory brokerage accounts. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth quarter results will reflect market valuations as of October 1, which were up from both a year ago and from July 1. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined a year ago driven by net losses on debt securities related to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio, partially offset by improved results from our venture capital investments. Turning to our 2024 outlook for net interest income and non-interest expense on Slide 17. We currently expect fourth quarter 2024 net interest income to be roughly in-line with the third quarter of 2024, which would imply an approximately 9% decline in full year 2024 net interest income compared with 2023. Based on this expectation, we believe we are close to the trough. However, exactly when the securities will be influenced by a variety of factors, including the pace of Fed rate changes, deposit mix and pricing and day count. Turning to expenses. We still expect full year 2024 non-interest expense to be approximately $54 billion, which has not changed from our guidance last quarter. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year. In summary, we had solid results in the third quarter, which demonstrated the progress we are making to transform Wells Fargo and improve our returns. We grew non-interest income by 12% from a year ago, with growth across most businesses. We achieved this double-digit growth even with the $447 million loss, we took to reposition the investment securities portfolio, which will start to benefit our results in the fourth quarter. While this growth in non-interest income was more than offset by an expected decline in net interest income, the investments we have made in our businesses drive better fee income and diversify our revenue were evident. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives with expenses down from a year ago and headcount down for 17 consecutive quarters. Our results also reflected our credit discipline and strong capital position which has enabled us to return more than $23 billion to shareholders over the past year through common stock, dividends and share repurchases. And while we are pleased with the progress we've made, we are even more excited about the additional opportunity we have throughout all the businesses to continue to improve our results. We will now take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Sir, please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Good morning everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Mike, I was hoping to start with NII. So your fourth quarter number should be flattish with the third quarter level. And I believe you mentioned towards the end of your prepared remarks that you believe Wells is sort of close to the trough. I was hoping you could just unpack please a bit more what you see as the swing -- the main swing factors either way, as well as kind of what it might take from here for it to begin to inflect back up -- pardon me, back upward more visibly? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, Scott. I appreciate the question. So I mean, it is the same drivers we've been talking about now for the last number of quarters. So obviously, deposits and the mix of those deposits is going to be a big factor in the near-term. I think as you can see in our trend that NIB deposits were behaving pretty well. I will note, though in the trend that there is a product switch conversion that we did that sort of impacted NIVs and IVs. So if you take that out, or the percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits is effectively flat to the third quarter. And so that's the first time now in a while where we've seen that be the case. And so that's one of the factors that we'll have to see sort of play out for a little bit longer time period. But so far, so good in terms of that trend participating in the way we thought or behaving the way we thought. Obviously, deposit pricing, as rates come back down or is going to be a big factor. If you look at, as I said in my remarks, on the consumer side, we've already adjusted promo rates, as well as CDs, those will continue to adjust as rates move. We're seeing exactly what we thought we would see on the most interest rate-sensitive deposits on the commercial side, as rates started to come down, the betas are exactly what we thought and are pretty high for those deposits. So that's working. Obviously, we haven't seen any loan growth, but we weren't expecting that, but that will be a factor as you sort of look a little bit -- over a little bit longer time period. And then this is a little bit in the [weeds] (ph), but as you sort of look at the first quarter, you do have day counts and things to kind of adjust for. So you could bounce around a little bit depending on the quarter based on factors like that as well. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. And then you touch -- I appreciate that. And then you touched on loan demand is a factor as well. You all have been pretty reserved regarding that backdrop throughout the year, which has been borne out to be correct. I guess, hopefully, we're beginning to get some clarity on some of the unresolved issues like cost to borrow, and I guess we're getting closer to the election. Maybe just some additional thoughts on the overall outlook there, if possible, please. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. No, I think -- I mean, you hit on a couple of the things that people are thinking about. But based on the conversations our teams are having with clients, I think people are still being very prudent about borrowing. I think the 50 basis point reduction is helpful, but not by itself a factor that will drive people to borrow or not, I think they will need to see that come down more meaningfully if that's like the driving force. The uncertainty around the election, the uncertainty around the just macro backdrop, I think as people get more confidence that the baseline case of a soft landing will materialize, you get past the election, you see rates come down a little bit. I think all those things will come together and help give clients more confidence about either building inventories or making further capital expenditures that they're just -- they're holding off on now. So I think you got to see a few of those things come together. And as you say, as we get closer to the end of the year, you'll start to get a little bit more visibility there, and we'll see as it goes. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open sir. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi, good morning. Charlie Scharf : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess first question, I think Charlie addressed this a little bit in his opening remarks around expenses. And I appreciate you're not talking about 2025 today. But big picture, looking at your Slide 7, personnel expenses flat 8.6% year-over-year; non-comp flat 4.2% year-over-year. From a shareholder perspective, and given what you've said, is it fair to assume we continue to see some of this flat lining trend where there are enough savings to reinvest in the platform, grow fee revenues and do all the stuff that you're doing, but without seeing a meaningful change in these two categories as we look forward? Charlie Scharf : Ebrahim, this is Charlie. I guess I'll just repeat what we've said in the past, which is we think that there continue to be meaningful efficiencies around the company, but we also are investing in both spending whatever we need to spend in the risk and regulatory space, as well as investing for the future. And when we get to next quarter, we'll talk about 2025, and we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves -- because that's something that we think we've done a good job of balancing historically, and we'll continue to balance it going forward in our thinking, and \u2013 when we've got specifics to share, we'll share it. Mike Santomassimo : And Ebrahim, I'll just maybe point out one other thing. As you look at things like personnel expense, obviously there is lots that go underneath that. So we are seeing the efficiency come through on salaries and other items. And that's offset by revenue related expense, mostly in the wealth and investment management business. And so that's a good thing, right? So you may see that bounce around, but underneath that is the efficiency really coming through as headcount continues to come down, I think we both probably pointed it out that headcount came down again in the quarter. So we are continuing to execute on that part of the efficiency agenda, as well as all the other non-personnel expenses. Charlie Scharf : But again, I just -- I don't think our thinking has changed about efficiency opportunities, but also opportunities to invest. We just need to go through our own internal process as we think about 2025 and when we finish that, we\u2019ll share. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And just maybe one quick Mike, I'm sorry if I missed it on NII. It's an asset-sensitive balance sheet, because of September 50 basis points cut. I would have assumed fourth quarter NII would have declined and maybe there's about $50 million of bond book restructuring help. Just why then I not going down despite the 50 basis points cut? And is there more room for additional restructuring as we look forward? Thank you. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I mean, look, it's just a confluence of all the factors that come together right around sort of what's happening with the mix of deposits. Our mix is a little bit different obviously than others. I think the pricing actions we took across the deposit base help as you look into the fourth quarter as well. And then obviously, we've got assets continue to kind of reprice up. We've got the repositioning, but also just normal reinvestment as we've seen maturities roll. I think on repositioning, we've been sort of repositioning the portfolio for a while, and we'll continue to look at it. Nothing on the horizon right now, but we'll continue to look at it as we always do, and we'll let you know if we decide to do more. Charlie Scharf : And the only thing I'd add is when you think about just rate movement, you need to look at the different points along the curve. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And the steeper the better, I assume. Charlie Scharf : Deeper is generally better overall, period of time, yeah? Ebrahim Poonawala : Thanks for taking my questions. Charlie Scharf : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. My first question is, could you remind us based on your understanding, what happens next after you submit your third-party review to the Fed, as it relates to the asset cap work stream? Charlie Scharf : Well, so just the way consent orders work, I'll answer it very generally because we don't talk about anything specific relative to where we are and what the timing is. We haven't and we won't, is you get a consent order. We need to do the work to develop a very detailed plan. The regulators then look at that plan and give us feedback on the plan. We execute on that plan. And whatever is required in that submission when we're done with the work, we submit it to them. And then they have done some work along the way, but they generally do a review after the submission. And then they've got a series of formal processes that they need to go through to make the decision on whether the work has been done to their satisfaction. And when that's done, we find out about it and you find out about it. Erika Najarian : Got it. Okay. And just as a follow-up, you bought back $3.5 billion of shares in the third quarter. Mike, is this about the -- is the pace that we should expect until we get your next SCB in June? I'm just trying to think about framing the buyback opportunity over the next few quarters? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, Erika, we don't really talk about quarter-to-quarter pace. But I think if you look at where we stand from a capital perspective, we're 150 basis points over the new reg minimum plus buffers of 9.8%. So we go into this environment with plenty of excess capital. We are going to generate more capital, obviously through earnings as we go. And then we go through the normal process that we go through every quarter to look at sort of the opportunities we have to help support clients. We look at the risks that are out there, and then we'll decide on the exact pacing sort of as we go. But we're happy that we were able to buy back $15.5 billion so far year-to-date. And continuing to give excess capital back to shareholders is something that's top of mind for us. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Charlie Scharf : Good morning. Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. So first question, just want to understand if the asset cap were to be removed -- well, I should say when the asset cap is removed, right? What -- are there opportunities for you to lean in anywhere in terms of asset growth? Because I've heard you in the past several times, and I would assume it's the same today that the asset cap is not keeping you from doing anything that you want to do. And maybe that's wrong. But I just want to understand where you would lean in if it -- when it does get removed. Charlie Scharf : Sure. Mike, I'll start and then you can either amplify or change if you disagree with anything I say. I think what we see and what we have talked a little bit about is the places where we have been the most careful about the assets and our liabilities today is around. On the wholesale deposit side, there is certainly been places where we've had to be very careful about not bringing on significant deposits because we want to make sure that we've got the room to serve customers elsewhere, both relative to their borrowing needs, as well as consumer deposits. And obviously, when commercial deposits come in, it brings cash with it. The other place has been in our markets business, where we actually -- since the asset cap has been in existence, we've not just limited, but reduced somewhat the financing abilities that we have for our customers. So those are the two places where we would probably see the impact immediately, not incredibly significant changes by any stretch of the imagination, but we've been -- had to be very, very careful in those two places. And then beyond that, it is just normal growth opportunities that we would see across all the different parts of the company. Betsy Graseck : And on the expense side, you've talked in the past about the $2.2 billion that has been invested to address the issues in the consent order and to deal with them. When the consent order goes away, is there an opportunity to pull back on that at all? Charlie Scharf : We're not even -- honestly, we literally aren't even thinking about that. We still have more work to do. We've said that -- that is the most important thing. At some point, can we become more efficient in some of the things? Absolutely. But what's most important is, from our standpoint to make sure that the things we've built become part of the culture of the company. So it is just not -- it's just -- when we think about efficiencies, we think about there are plenty of other places for us to drive efficiencies and not focus on those activities at this point. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks so much, Charlie. Operator : The next question will come from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. I was hoping you guys could talk about the anti-money laundering KYC, the disclosure in the 10-Q [value investigation] (ph) and then there was some regulatory outcome on that, and given that it was in your 10-Q and so public. Wondering if you could just add some color around it? And then also just what it might mean to expenses and anything else we should be mindful of going forward? Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Yes. I mean we put out something when we entered into the formal agreement with the OCC. And like other things that we find and they find, we take them extremely seriously. We're going to get the work done. As I've said in my prepared remarks, I think as we identify issues and we see that there are things that have to get built, we've got confidence that we've got the ability to do it. I would say, relative to the cost around it, I'd say, the two different pieces, which is just like all of the control-related work, we are going to spend whatever is necessary. At this point, as we sit and look at the $54 billion expense base, don't see it having anything meaningfully that we need to talk about beyond our ability to spend as we've discussed. And I would also mention that, and I think we've said something about this which is a significant amount of the work that is required in the consent order, we've been working on. And so as we think about what we are spending, we are spending a significant amount of money relative to what's necessary in that order already. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then are you able to comment is this kind of a Wells specific thing or an industry-wide kind of area focus because you know the banks are responsible not just for kind of policing their customers, but really keeping track of all the money that is moving around. It seems like it could be a broad --. Charlie Scharf : We're not going to speak -- we speak for ourselves and what we know. Beyond that, is not right or appropriate. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from David Long of Raymond James. Your line is open. David Long : Good morning everyone. I just wanted to follow up with the regulatory side. And can you remind us of the mechanics of the asset cap without providing any insight as to when you think it may come off. But can the asset cap be removed in your opinion without the consent order being removed completely? Charlie Scharf : Listen, I would -- for anyone who's -- if you have questions on the 2018 Fed consent order, it is very readable. It's something like -- I don't remember exactly, but it is like 5 pages -- 7 pages Mike is telling me of which there are like \u2013 there is a page in there, which is really the page that lays out what we have to accomplish and how the Fed is going to look at things. So it really is very digestible. So I will give you a brief summary. But again, please, I'd point you back to it if you want to go through it. We are required to -- the Board needs to be more effective. We need to build out operational risk and compliance in the company. There is -- to lift the asset cap that work needs to be adopted and implemented, and to lift the entire consent order needs to be effective and sustainable. And so that's what's laid out the way the Fed will interpret those things, and relative to things going on in the company is certainly in their bailiwick. As I've said, we are very focused on getting the work done, and feel good about our ability to get it done, given what we've shown that we can do here. David Long : Got it. Thank you, Charlie. I appreciate it. And then the other question I had was related to the trading gains line, and you've been putting up over $1 billion there per quarter in trading gains. What are some of the puts and takes in that line that can create some volatility on a quarter-to-quarter basis? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, it's Michael, I'll take that. Obviously, volatility in the market a big factor. So it's kind of the market conditions that we operate in. You generally have some seasonality to that line item as well in the third and fourth quarter as you get to the holiday season. And then I think where we've though been focused there is really just continuing to methodically improve the capabilities, make sure we got the right people in the right seats. We continue to improve our -- all of our technology and e-trading capabilities. And we're seeing good results of that, but it's something that can move around based on market conditions quite a bit, but our focus is just to make sure that we continue to have the right capabilities to serve clients. And we've been pleased now that we've strung together probably seven quarters of pretty good performance there, and we\u2019ll look forward to happens going forward. David Long : Great. Thanks Mike. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Operator : The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. Just around the -- a little bit more around the securities repositioning, how much of a benefit to net interest income did the securities repositioning have this quarter? And how much of a -- would it be a full quarter impact that you would expect for the fourth quarter? Mike Santomassimo : Very little in the third quarter. It is all done. So it's in the run rate for the fourth quarter. John Pancari : Okay. And then have you sized up that impact and what it would mean for NII for the fourth quarter? Mike Santomassimo : It's in the -- in my remarks where we did about $16 billion of repositioning. We picked up about 130 basis points on that. So I mean, obviously, you got to go day count and other things to adjust, but it is pretty easy to model. John Pancari : Right. Okay. All right. Thanks. And then separately, just around the fee income commentary, I appreciate the color you provided around the trading outlook. Can you perhaps unpack the rest of your expectations there just on the fee side, how we should think about the trajectory of wealth management and possibly on the card side and IB as well. Just what you're seeing there in terms of underlying drivers? Charlie Scharf : Well, first -- it's a hard -- I mean there are like 15 underlying drivers, right? And so you should look at each of the specifics and do your own modeling based upon what you think, right? We've got credit card revenues. We've got trading. We've got all these different pieces. It's just not one monolithic number. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And maybe I'll just give you a couple of pieces of color underneath that. So obviously, on the investment management line, market levels matter a lot. As we've pointed out, about two-thirds of that line is equities, the rest is fixed income. Most of it gets priced in advance based on the prior -- the first day of the quarter or the last day of the quarter, prior quarter. So you can -- so that's a pretty good way to sort of think about that line going forward. If you look at card fees, as Charlie talked about, we've got a debit card and credit card business, as we sort of see growth across the economy and we are successful in growing our business, that will drive that line. Investment banking is somewhat market dependent, but we've been investing there quite a bit. And so the goal is to increase market share methodically over time. And so those are kind of the biggest pieces of the puzzle there. But hopefully, that's a little helpful. John Pancari : No, it is helpful, Mike. I appreciate you walking through the details there. Operator : And the final question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Mike. Hi, Charlie. Can you guys share with us maybe a little color on the commercial real estate office portfolio. It looks like the stabilization may be sitting in on the credit quality. Can -- any indicators of is it getting less worse? Or when you go into market property down the markets maybe aren't as severe as they were six months ago or 12 months ago. Any further details here? Charlie Scharf : I'll take it. It is an interesting question because it depends on -- I think it depends on who you talk to and how you actually answer -- how you actually ask the question. Meaning, when we look at what's actually happening, things aren't getting better, and it is kind of more of the same but it's impacting more properties. Maybe to some extent, there is a little bit of contagion to properties that are fairly well leased, but people are looking for better deals because they think there's weakness out there. So you see a little bit of that. But what you see is just more of the significant revaluation because of supply and demand that's going on as these properties kind of move through the cycle. So as we look at it, our kind of big picture is based upon what we expected there aren't material changes at all. We are actually seeing that play out, but things are getting worse because there are more properties being impacted. So it depends on whether it's versus your expectations or what you've seen in the prior period. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. And Gerard, I [may just add one] (ph) other piece. So it's the same -- we're seeing the same kind of trend where kind of new buildings, renovated buildings in good locations are doing fine. It's older office buildings pretty consistent across the U.S. But as Charlie said, it's within the expectations we've had, which we have been pretty -- we were pretty down on the space now for a while. And so it's playing out kind of largely within that range of what we thought. But it's going to -- and as I have said over and over, like it's going to take a while to play out. This is not something that will take a quarter or two and be over. It will play out over a longer period of time. And we feel really good about our allowance for coverage ratio. We feel like that's more than appropriate for kind of what we expect to see here. And we are going to continue to work with clients as best we can through it. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then I know -- gosh, it's only been less than a month since the Fed cut the Fed funds rate and obviously, the forward curve is calling for more. And you guys, as you addressed in your prepared remarks, Mike, about deposit costs. The behavior, I know again, it is early, but any comments on -- are you seeing the consumers and the corporate customers behaving as expected in terms of what they are doing with their deposits with lower rates? And as the second part of that question, with your loan-to-deposit ratio not being very high, of course, is there more room for you to lower deposit costs and not have to be as concerned being over levered? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I would say, look, the short answer on the behavior side is not much has changed since in the last three weeks. The trend, though, that we have seen now for the better part of a year-ish is that we've seen less migration to higher yielding alternatives. We've seen good stabilization of deposits across the businesses. Those trends are all still true. And we are not seeing that shift in any significant way in any of the businesses at this point. I think as you look at both deposit pricing and the other side of the equation that you sort of brought up, on the loan side, we feel it is really important to have a very consistent approach to underwriting credit over a long period of time, and that's kind of where -- what we've been doing. And I think that's served us well, and I think that's going to continue to be the approach. On the deposit side, I think we'll do -- we'll make the decisions we think are the right decisions to -- product by product and client by client, based on the relationships we have. And I think -- and so far again, that's worked out well for us. So that's the approach we are going to continue to take. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Appreciate the color and candor. Thank you Mike Santomassimo : Okay, we thank everyone for joining us, and we'll talk to you next time. Operator : Thank you all for your participation on today's conference call.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. John Campbell : Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings material. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie. Charlie Scharf : Thanks, John. Let me start by acknowledging the unbelievable devastation from the Los Angeles wildfires. Our hearts go out to everyone who's been affected and we're committed to helping rebuild their lives, businesses and communities. I also want to thank our employees, who are working hard to support our customers, many of whom who have been impacted themselves. Turning to Wells Fargo's performance. I'll make some brief comments about our results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results as well as our net interest income and expense expectations for 2025 before we take your questions. Let me start with some general comments. Our solid performance this quarter taps a year of significant progress for Wells Fargo across multiple areas. Our earnings profile continues to improve. We are seeing the benefits from investments we're making to increase growth and improve how we serve our customers and communities. We maintained a strong balance sheet, we returned $25 billion of capital to shareholders, and we made significant progress on our risk and control work. We grew net income and our diluted earnings per share was up 11% from a year ago. After I arrived, we reviewed our businesses and sold or scaled back several which reduced revenues in the shorter term and increased investments in others. We also made a conscious effort to diversify revenues and reduce our reliance on net interest income. In 2024, our strong fee-based revenue growth, up 15% from a year ago, largely offset the expected decline in net interest income, reflecting these efforts. Our disciplined approach to managing expense levels has been consistent and an important part of our success. We increased investments in areas that are important for our future and generated efficiencies to help fund those opportunities. Overall, expenses declined from a year ago, benefiting from lower FDIC and severance expenses as well as the impact of our efficiency initiatives, which have helped drive headcount reductions every quarter since third quarter of 2020. We maintained our strong credit discipline and credit performance was relatively stable throughout the year and consistent with our expectations. Average loans declined throughout the year, as credit card -- as growth in credit card balances was offset by declines in most other asset classes, reflecting weak loan demand as well as credit tightening actions. Average deposits grew from fourth quarter 2023, with growth in our deposit gathering businesses, enabling us to reduce higher cost CDs issued by corporate treasury. We've been actively returning excess capital over the past five years, and that has resulted in average common shares outstanding decreasing by 21% since fourth quarter 2019. This year, we increased our common stock dividend per share by 15% and repurchased approximately $20 billion of common stock, up 64% from a year ago. Regarding our strategic priorities, I'm very proud of the progress we've made on our risk and control work, and it remains our top priority and closing consent orders is an important sign of progress. Early last year, the OCC terminated a consent order it issued in 2016 regarding sales practices. The closure of disorder was an important milestone and is a confirmation that we operate much differently today. This was the sixth consent order terminated by our regulators since I joined Wells Fargo in 2019. Our operational risk and compliance infrastructure is greatly changed from when I arrived and while we are not done, I'm confident that we will successfully complete the work required in our consent orders and embed in operational risk and compliance mindset into our culture. Our results also show our progress on the other strategic priorities that we have. Improving our credit card platform is an important strategic objective and our progress here is clear. Since 2021, we have rolled out a total of 11 new cars, including four new consumer cards and a new small business card in 2024. Our new product offerings continue to be well received by both existing customers and customers new to Wells Fargo with over 2.4 million new credit card accounts opened in 2024. We've done this while maintaining our credit standards. The momentum in this business is also demonstrated by strong credit card spend, up over $17 billion from a year ago. In our auto business, we announced a multiyear co-branded agreement where we will be the preferred purchase finance provider for Volkswagen and Audi brands in the United States, starting in the first half of this year. We continue to reposition our home lending business as we execute on the strategic direction we announced in early 2023. We've reduced head count by 47% and the amount of third-party mortgage loan service by 28% since the announcement as we continue to streamline this business. The business is more profitable today and opportunities remain to improve. After several years of little to no growth, as we focused on satisfying the requirements of our consent orders, we are starting to generate growth and increase customer engagement in our consumer, small and business banking segment. We had a more meaningful growth in net checking accounts in 2024. And importantly, most of that growth came in the form of more valuable primary checking accounts. We had over 10 billion debit card transactions last year, up 2% from a year ago, the highest annual volume in our history. We accelerated our efforts to refurbish our branches, completing 730 in 2024. We continue to make enhancements to our mobile app, including making it significantly easier to open accounts, and in the fourth quarter, over 40% of consumer check accounts were up additionally. We grew mobile active customers by 1.5 million in 2024, up 5% from a year ago. Our customers are also increasingly using Zelle, and we have over $1 billion in sales transactions in 2024, up 22% from a year ago. We introduced Wells Fargo Premier to better serve our affluent clients, and we're starting to see some early benefits from the enhancements we've made. We increased the number of premier bankers by 8% and branch-based financial advisers by 5% from a year ago, with a focus on increasing the number of bankers and advisers in top locations. We have enhanced our customer relationship management capabilities for our bankers and advisers. This is increased collaboration, driving $23 billion in net asset lows into Wealth and Investment Management Premier channel last year. Deposit and investment balances for Premier clients grew steadily throughout the year and increased approximately 10% from a year ago. This remains a significant area of opportunity for us. Turning to our commercial business. In the commercial bank, we're focused on adding relationship managers and business development officers in underpenetrated and growth markets to drive new client acquisition, future revenue growth, and we expect to hire even more in 2025. We created a strategic partnership with Centerbridge Partners and introduced overland advisers to better service our commercial bank customers with the direct lending product. We have targeted our investment banking capabilities towards our commercial banking clients. We're still early in these efforts, but we're starting to see results including our investment banking market share with our commercial banking clients increasing by approximately 150 basis points in 2024, which includes helping some clients access capital markets for the first time. Additionally, we've been working closely with our clients to support their M&A activity, driving higher M&A-related revenue. The opportunity remains significant. We continue to make investments in talent and technology to strengthen corporate investment banking. More than 75 new hires joined CIB since 2019, with many of these in key convergent product groups within trading and banking and our revenue and share in many important areas has increased including in our markets business, where we've grown our U.S. market share, including credit trading, commodities and our equity cash and derivatives business. We also continue to make steady progress in growing our FX business with strong growth in both our institutional client base and volumes in 2024. We also grew our U.S. market share in investing banking with share gains in debt and equity capital markets and increased revenue in our advisory business in 2024. We entered 2025 with a solid pipeline in both Capital Markets and Advisory, while the market conditions can always change. I feel great about our progress and continue to believe we're just beginning to see the benefits of our investments. We've also continued to exit or sell businesses that are not in sync with our strategic priorities. And last year, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the non-agency third-party servicing segment of our commercial mortgage servicing business. More broadly, the U.S. economy has performed very well and remains strong and lower inflation and unemployment position the economy well into 2025. We are predominantly a U.S. bank. We succeed when the country succeeds. So, the incoming administration support of U.S. businesses and consumers gives us optimism as we look forward. Additionally, the incoming administration has signaled a more business-friendly approach to policies and regulation, which should benefit the economy and our clients. Mike will talk more about our expectations for 2025. But as we start the new year, I'm enthusiastic about the opportunities we have to drive higher returns across our businesses by growing revenue and managing expenses. I'm proud of the progress we made in 2024. I want to conclude by thanking everyone who works at Wells Fargo, their hard work for what they do every single day to support our customers, clients and communities. I'm excited about the momentum we're building and all that we can accomplish together in 2025. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Santomassimo : Thank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. We had solid results in the fourth quarter, including net income of $5.1 billion or $1.43 per diluted common share. Underlying business performance was strong compared to a year ago. We grew fee income across most categories, maintained our expense and credit discipline and grew customer accounts and activity levels as we benefited from the investments that Charlie highlighted. We also grew net interest income from the third quarter. Our fourth quarter results included $863 million or $0.26 per share of discrete tax benefits related to resolution of prior period matters. This benefit was largely offset by $647 million or $0.15 per share of severance expense and $448 million or $0.10 per share of net losses on the sale of debt securities as we took the opportunity to further reposition a portion of the investment portfolio. This included the sale of approximately $8 million of securities, which we reinvested into higher-yielding securities. The estimated payback period for this repositioning is approximately 2.5 years. Turning to Slide 4. Net interest income grew $146 million or 1% from the third quarter, the first linked-quarter increase since the fourth quarter of 2022. The increase was driven by higher customer deposit balances, which enabled us to continue to reduce higher cost market funding. Moving to Slide 5. Average loans were down from both the third quarter and a year ago, Period-end balances grew $3 billion from the third quarter with growth in commercial and industrial loans and credit card loans more than offsetting declines in most other categories. Average deposits increased both from the third quarter and a year ago with growth in our customer deposits, enabling us to reduce higher-cost corporate treasury deposits. Average deposit cost declined 18 basis points from the third quarter as deposit costs stabilized or declined across all of our deposit gathering businesses. In response to the Federal Reserve rate cuts, we have reduced standard pricing for commercial clients as well as pricing for promotional deposit offers and CDs in our consumer businesses. Lower deposit costs also reflected the slowdown of customer migration to higher yielding deposits. Additionally, lower cost consumer deposit balances and checking and saving accounts have continued to stabilize. Turning to Slide 6. We had strong growth in noninterest income, up 11% from a year ago, benefiting from the investments we've been making in our businesses as well as market conditions. This growth was diversified with each of our operating segments generating growth from a year ago. I'll highlight the specific drivers of noninterest income and discussing our operating segment results. Turning to expenses on Slide 7. Noninterest expense declined 12% from a year ago, driven by the lower FDIC special assessment. Excluding this assessment, expenses were relatively stable as lower severance expense and the impact of our efficiency initiatives was largely offset by higher revenue-related compensation predominantly in Wealth and Investment Management as well as higher technology and equipment expense. Turning to credit quality on Slide 8. Credit performance has been relatively stable with our net loan charge-off ratio the same as a year ago and up 4 basis points from the third quarter. Commercial net loan charge-offs increased $80 million from the third quarter to 30 basis points of average loans, driven by the commercial real estate office portfolio. Commercial real estate office fundamentals have not changed and remain weak. We still expect commercial real estate office losses to be lumpy as we continue to actively work with our clients. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased $20 million from the third quarter to 85 basis points of average loans, driven by higher losses in the credit card portfolio, which was consistent with our expectations. Nonperforming assets declined 5% from the third quarter, driven by a $390 million decline in commercial real estate office nonaccrual loans, which includes paydowns and net loan charge-offs. Moving to Slide 9. Our allowance for credit losses for loans was down $103 million from the third quarter, with modest declines across most asset classes partially offset by the increase in allowance for credit card loans driven by higher loan balances. Our allowance coverage for total loans has been relatively stable over the past five quarters as credit trends have remained fairly consistent. Our allowance coverage for our corporate and investment banking and commercial real estate office portfolio increased 12% as loan balances continued to decline and allowance levels were relatively stable. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11.1% continues to be well above our CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8%. We repurchased $4 million of common stock in the fourth quarter and approximately $20 million for the year, reducing common shares outstanding by 9% from a year ago. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking lending on Slide 11. Consumer Small and Business Banking revenue declined 7% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, reflecting the impact of customers migrating to higher yield and deposit products. However, the pace of the migration continues to slow. Home lending revenue grew 2% from a year ago driven by higher mortgage banking fees. Credit card revenue grew 3% from a year ago as loan balances increased and card fees grew from a higher point of sale volume. We continue to be pleased with the performance of new products that we launched over the last 3.5 years, with credit performing as expected and strong growth in new accounts and usage. Auto revenue decreased 21% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances, reflecting previous credit tightening actions and continued loan spread compression. The decline in personal lending revenue from a year ago is also driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 12. Retail mortgage originations increased 31% from a year ago with higher purchase volume as well as stronger refinance volume early in the quarter when interest rates were lower. Debit card spending was strong in the fourth quarter and increased $4.9 billion or 4% from a year ago, and credit card spending was up 9% from a year ago, with growth in all categories except fuel. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue was down 2% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, reflecting higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury management fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 12% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income and lease income, partially offset by improved results from our equity investments. Average loan balances in the fourth quarter were down 1% compared with a year ago as growth in middle market banking was more than offset by lower balances in asset-based lending. While our commercial clients are generally more optimistic, we did not see a meaningful change in loan demand in the fourth quarter as many clients remain cautious. Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by higher deposit costs and lower loan balances. This decline was partially offset by higher investment banking revenue from increased activity in equity and debt capital markets as well as higher advisory fees. Commercial real estate revenue decreased 1% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances, partially offset by higher capital markets revenue from higher volumes in commercial mortgage-backed securities, real estate loan syndications and multifamily capital as market sentiment improves. Markets revenue was down 5% from a year ago, driven by lower revenues in equities and municipals, partially offset by stronger performance than most other products, fixed income products. Our fourth quarter results reflected the implementation of a change to incorporate funding valuation adjustments for our derivatives which resulted in a loss of $85 million. The decline from the third quarter was also driven by seasonally lower trading activity across most asset classes. Average loans declined 6% from a year ago, driven by continued reductions in our commercial real estate portfolio driven by office as well as lower loan balances in banking as clients continued to access to capital markets for funding. On Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 8% compared with a year ago due to higher asset-based fees driven by increased market valuations. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so first quarter results will reflect market valuations as of January 1, which were up from both a year ago and from October 1. Average deposits increased by 16% and average loans grew by 2% from a year ago, which have both benefited from product enhancements and pricing improvements that provide value to our clients. The growth in deposits also reflected the slowdown in migration to cash alternatives with balances in those products lower than a year ago. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue increased from a year ago, driven by improved results from our venture capital investments. After having impairments on these investments for the past two years, we had net gains every quarter in 2024 with improved performance in the second half of the year. Now turning to our outlook on Slide 17. I'll go into more detail on our 2025 expectations for net interest income and noninterest expense in the next few slides, but first, I want to highlight the progress we've made on improving our returns. When we first started discussing the outlook for our returns in the fourth quarter of 2020, we had an 8% ROTCE. Over the past four years, we have been successfully executing on our efficiency initiatives, diversifying our sources of revenue by investing in our businesses to better serve our customers and drive growth and returning excess capital to shareholders. These actions helped to improve our ROTCE to 13.4% in 2024. We still believe we have an achievable path to a sustainable ROTCE of 15% as we continue to make progress on transforming the Company, including the priorities highlighted earlier on the call. On Slide 18, we provide our expectations for net interest income for 2025. We had $47.7 billion of net interest income in 2024, which was within the expected range we provided at the start of last year. Net interest income declined sequentially for the first three quarters of the year before growing modestly in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter annualized net interest income is $47 billion or approximately $700 million lower than full year 2024. Our current expectation is that full year 2025 net interest income will be approximately 1% to 3% higher than full year 2024 or approximately 3% to 5% higher than the annualized fourth quarter 2024 net interest income. We expect net interest income will be relatively stable in the first half of 2025, which includes the impact from two fewer days in the first quarter with more growth in the second half of the year. Underpinning our expectations are a series of key assumptions, including using the recent forward rate curve, which includes between 1 and 2 Federal Reserve rate cuts, given our modestly asset-sensitive position, this will be a slight headwind to net interest income. Average loans are expected to grow modestly from fourth quarter of 2024 to fourth quarter of 2025 driven by anticipated growth in the Corporate Investment Bank markets group and CIB banking as well as anticipated growth in our auto and credit card portfolios. Deposits in all our deposit gathering businesses are expected to grow modestly, which would allow us to further reduce higher-cost market funding. Reinvestment of lower-yielding securities into higher yielding assets, our expectation also reflects the benefits from the actions we took in the second half of 2024 to reposition the investment portfolio. And trading-related net interest income is expected to be higher due to lower interest rates which would largely be offset by lower trading-related noninterest income. As we've done in prior years, for the purposes of estimating net interest income, we are also assuming the asset capital remained in place throughout the year. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned in 2025 will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the curve, deposit balances, mix and pricing and loan demand. Now turning to our 2025 expense expectations on Slide 19. Following the waterfall on the slide from left to right, we reported $54.6 billion of noninterest expense in 2024, which includes $647 million of severance expense in the fourth quarter that was not contemplated in our guidance. Our 2025 expense expectation includes operating losses of approximately $1.1 billion, which is approximately $700 million lower than operating losses in 2024. Looking at the next bar, we expect severance expense to be approximately $500 million lower in 2025 given the expense of pool we took in the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect Wealth and Investment Management revenue-related expenses to increase by approximately $600 million in 2025. As a reminder, this is a good thing as these higher expenses were more offset by higher noninterest income. Actual revenue-related expenses will be a function of market levels with the biggest driver being the equity markets. Our outlook that assumes the S&P 500 will be up modestly from current levels, but clearly, the ultimate performance of the markets is uncertain. We expect all other expenses to be up approximately $200 million with the impact of efficiency initiatives, more than offset by higher investments in other expenses. We expect approximately $2.4 billion of gross expense reductions in 2025 due to efficiency initiatives. We've successfully delivered on more than $12 billion of gross expense saves since we started focusing on efficiency initiatives four years ago, and we continue to believe we have opportunities to get more efficient across the Company. Keep in mind, however, the resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives. There are three primary areas where we expected to invest. First, we expect approximately $900 million of incremental technology expense, including investments in infrastructure and business capabilities. Second, we expect approximately $900 million of incremental other investments, including the specific areas we highlighted on the next slide. Finally, we expect other expenses to increase by approximately $800 million, including expected merit increases in performance-based discretionary compensation. As a reminder, the first quarter has seasonally higher personnel expenses, which are expected to be $650 million to $700 million. Putting this all together, we expect 2025 noninterest expense to be approximately $54.2 billion. On Slide 20, we provide some examples of our areas of focus for the investments, which are critical to better serving our customers and generating growth. Let me highlight a few. Building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. We continue to invest in technology and digital platforms to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers. This includes continuing the transition of our applications to the cloud, migrating into new data centers and investing in data platforms to drive more insights. We are continuing to upgrade our core lending capabilities, including improvements to our fulfillment and servicing systems, enhancing private decisioning and strengthening fraud capabilities. To drive customer growth in the consumer businesses, we plan to continue scaling our marketing efforts, modernizing our branch footprint and increasing the number of premier bankers and financial advisers. We are also focused on onboarding more independent advisers as we continue building out our independent brokerage channel. In addition, we continue to improve our digital capabilities for our customers, specifically our mobile account opening and onboarding as well as Zelle. We plan to continue hiring priority sectors to help drive growth in investment banking and capital markets. We also plan to continue hiring relationship bankers within commercial banking to build out coverage in underpenetrated markets in key industries. In summary, our results in 2024 demonstrated the continued progress we've been making to improve our financial performance. We generated strong fee-based revenue growth, reduced our expenses, maintain strong credit discipline, increased capital returns to shareholders and retained our strong capital position. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made so far and excited about the additional opportunities we have to continue to try and improve performance. We will now take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John McDonald of Truist Securities. Your line is open. John McDonald : Mike, I was hoping you could unpack the deposit expectations embedded in Slide 18 and the NII outlook. You talked about stabilization of retail volumes and mix. Just kind of wanted to get a little more detail about what you're assuming for retail deposit growth mix and how that plays into the paydown of higher cost borrowings throughout the year in your plan? Mike Santomassimo : Yes, sure. Thanks, John, and welcome back and welcome to your new seat. Look, I think as we've sort of talked about now, I guess, for the last three or four quarters, we've been seeing less and less migration out of noninterest-bearing to interest bearing. You got to look through some of the product consolidations we did in the third quarter. So, there's some noise that we talked about last quarter. But so, we've seen continued sort of stabilization of the mix between noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing. And so that's sort of helpful as you go into this year, and we expect that to continue as we look forward and then start to see absolute growth across the consumer franchise. As you know, in the interest-bearing products in the consumer side, pricing hasn't really moved much through the cycle. And so, you're not seeing standard pricing change much, but you are seeing the promotional savings and CD rates continue to come down over the last 90, 120 days as rates have started to move. And so, we would expect that that mix to stabilize. We expect some absolute growth, and we don't expect pricing pressure to come through on the consumer side. John McDonald : Okay. Got it. And then just wanted to shift gears and ask about credit card profitability. When you're in growth mode, credit card experience is a drag from accounting on the upfront acquisition costs and provision. Where are you on card profitability now? Is that an upside driver to ROE? Is more of the balances roll off teasers and some of that upfront expense wanes. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, certainly is. I think as you look backwards a little bit, we started launching the new products 3.5 years ago. So, the first of the vintages came on starting in August -- July, August, a few years ago. And so, we're just starting to kind of see those earliest vintages mature and become more profitable. So, we're still early days in terms of seeing that profitability really come through in the P&L. I'd say, obviously, the factors you got to think about as you sort of look through that is the credit box and the credit performance, that's all behaving right on top of what we would have modeled. So, we're not seeing any concerns flow through from what we modeled across all of the different new products. And we're seeing, as Charlie highlighted in his script, we're seeing good new account growth, continue across the different products there. And so, it's just a matter of time for that to really more meaningfully come into the P&L. It really hasn't contributed much at all yet as you sort of look at it, but it will start to come through over the next year or two. Charlie Scharf : And John, this is Charlie. The only thing I would add, I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, but the two places that we think of as where we've already taken actions and assist execution now, which will improve profitability. One is card, as you pointed out. And the second I referenced is we're still not at the level of profitability where we should be in home lending, just given as we continue to wind down that servicing book. And so, we think those two things will be helpful for us as we look forward. Operator : The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess I just wanted to go back, maybe, Charlie, to something you talked about back in December on the back of the lifting of the OCC consent order. As we think about just the ROE trajectory for the bank, it will be useful if you can maybe give some tangible examples of things that you've been able to do post the lifting of the consent order in terms of incenting branch employees and where in the balance sheet or in the P&L, we should expect that to show up maybe as early as 2025. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Ebrahim, it's Mike. Maybe I'll start and Charlie can chime in if he wants to add. I think what you're referencing just to make sure everyone is clear, is the sales practices consent order, they got lifted last February. As part of the work, we had to do when that came on, we dialed back much of what you would expect to see in the branch system around incentive plans and sales goals and the like and to make sure that we built -- rebuilt the control framework and all of those things that we would do there in a way that would make sure that the problems of the past don't reoccur. And so, as we saw that consent order go away, we've been able to more fully roll out a standard sort of incentive framework across the branches. We have been piloting it for a while in a small subset. And as you would expect, you would see different performance and better performance in those pilot branches, and that's across new checking growth, credit card accounts and the like. And so, we're still in the early days to see the benefits of that system be put in place because it got rolled out throughout 2024. And so, we would expect to kind of see the results start to come through more meaningfully over the near term, medium term. Charlie Scharf : Maybe just a little more color to what Mike said. I think again, if you think back, it was hugely important that that we satisfied the obligations that existed in that consent order and that we were comfortable with the control environment that existed. And so, we took away, as Mike said, a whole series of things. It's not just one thing. It was compensation. It's recording goals, just the whole way we manage the system, as we were building out everything that would make us and our regulators comfortable as we managed the system in the future, similar to the way other people manage their system that if someone were to be doing something that wasn't appropriate that we had the right controls and reporting in place to catch it. So, it took a long time to build that out. But to have the confidence that we could add back a lot of these management mechanisms that you have in place. And so, no one individual thing is earth shattering. But when you take compensation, when you take reporting, when you take management routines, when you take all those things and put them together, at the same time, you're monitoring all the controls that you've built that's what gives us the confidence to go forward with the system that we think can attract more customers and do more with our existing customers, but within a very tightly controlled framework that we feel comfortable relative to how we manage the risk that's there. Mike Santomassimo : Ebrahim, actually, Charlie and a lot of other folks here have seen this before, and we're confident we're going to get the results we think out of it. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful color. And I guess, just maybe following up -- so thanks Mike for running through the expense investment priorities. As we think about the severance charge in the fourth quarter, and run way to extract additional efficiencies relative to $54.2 billion expense guide. How should we think about like are we getting to a point where some of the low-hanging fruit is done and expenses generally move higher given the investments and we should at least anticipate positive operating leverage on the way forward? Or do you still see opportunities to meaningfully cut costs, make things more efficient, especially in the consumer bank. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I think, Ebrahim, as we sort of look at what you see there and what we're doing in 2025, it's no different than -- the thinking is no different than it's been now for the last four or five years that we've both been here. I think as you look at the Company, we still feel like there's a significant amount of opportunity to drive efficiency, and that's what you see in 2025. And I know we've used this analogy a lot, but it is just like peeling an onion. And as you sort of look at the next layer down, you find more efficiency, you bring better technology, you bring better automation, which, by the way, saves us money, but also in a lot of cases, improves the client experience for our customers. And so, we -- as we come in every day, we still think about it the same way that we've been thinking about for a while, and that's what you see in the expectations for this year. Operator : The next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore. Your line is open. John Pancari : Good morning. On the NII outlook, I know you said it includes modest loan growth expectation for 2025. I just want to see if you can elaborate a little bit on how we could think about that in terms of level and trajectory? Should it be near GDP? Or how should we think about that? And then can you -- in addition to the sizing of the most likely drivers, maybe can you also give us a little bit of color on the pace of expected incremental runoff of balances as you look at the growth outlook? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. So, maybe I'll start on the loan side. So, as I said in my commentary, like we're expecting to see a little bit more of it as we get to the middle and second half of next year. So, we may see a little bit in the first half, but it's not be more meaningful as we go later in the year. I would think of it as like low to mid-single digits depending on the category of loans. But obviously, some of that will be dependent upon the overall backdrop that we're in. As you look at the consumer side of the picture, mortgages will likely continue to decline a little bit given sort of the rate environment we're in. We did see a little bit of incremental refinance activity in the fourth quarter. But now with rates back up, that seems to be back down again. We should see some card growth as we go through the year, and we should start to see some growth in the auto portfolio as well. On the commercial side, some of it will be new account new client growth as we go through the year. We've been adding bankers across different categories. We do expect to see some growth in the markets business as well to drive some loan growth. And so, it should come from a lot of -- a little bit from a lot of different areas across the population, but I would expect to see that a little bit more as we go into middle and second half of the year. John Pancari : Great. And then separately on capital, 11.1% CET1 pretty solid and you still bought back about $4 billion this quarter. How should we think about the buyback appetite as you look at 2025, assuming that you do see some improvement in organic growth opportunities, how could that influence your pace of buyback. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I mean, look, it's the standard sort of waterfall of decision-making that goes into it, right? If we've got good organic growth opportunities across loans and other categories, we're going to serve customers, that's always first. We still have the asset cap in place. So, there's some limits to that. we'll look at all the different risks that are out there across the different categories of items that we got to be concerned about. And then buybacks will kind of be the rest. And given we've got the after cap and given we've got limited organic growth depending on the quarter you're in, I think you'll see us continue to return capital back to shareholders like we've done now for the last number of years. At this point, we don't believe we need to be higher than where we are from a CET1 percentage. And so, we'll manage that based on those opportunities and those decisions that we talked about. Operator : The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Clearly, the way the stock has reacted the message from your shareholders has been an embrace of Wells Fargo was more than a remediation story. And thinking about the return improvement even beyond the asset cap resolution and the consent order. And I guess to that end, Charlie and Mike, you have a medium-term ROE target of 15%. In 2024, you generated almost 13.5%. And by your own commentary, you still have places like Card and Home Lending where your profitability should improve from here. You're carrying excess capital. You're under the asset cap. Obviously, you're making great efforts in CIB in terms of really using your balance sheet to generate even more fees and off of your relationships. And as we think about that 15%, especially in the context of you have one money center that has to hold more capital than you that has a 17% target and another money center that has to hold more capital to go than that 15% target. I guess, I'm wondering if your shareholders are thinking about fully realized wells beyond the remediation story, what is the true natural return of this business? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Let me -- Eric, thanks for that. I think I guess what we would say is -- well, let me just repeat what we've said in the past, right, which is when we look at our businesses, we look at each one individually and we compare ourselves to the best people out there in terms of performance. And it's both returns and growth that we look at because, again, other than our home lending business and I would say the auto business generally, we do expect that our businesses, given the quality should be growing at rates commensurate with some of the best out there in addition to having some of the strongest returns. So, when you compare us to other people, right, you've got to look at the mix of business, you got to look at the size of our different businesses versus others. But when we think about where we ultimately what our aspirations are, it is based upon where the others are by business and what our business mix looks like relative to how we think about our own targets and what the timing is, I guess we would just say, we got to think about it one step at a time. And we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We've said we want to get to 15%. We're close, but we're not there. And so, we want to achieve that for sure. We have to get out of these orders that we still have that do constrain us. And so there's a point at which we've said that not just yourself, but we, too, will address where we think we go from the 15%, but in due time. Operator : The next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : So, two questions. One, just to follow up on the last question that Eric asked on the drivers. We're in the last mile. So, congratulations we're in the last mile to the 15%. And are you thinking about that last mile as being driven by revenue growth happening faster in the businesses that have the higher returns? Or are there still expenses to be cut out such that the expense ratio and the expense focus is what's going to drive that? Mike Santomassimo : Betsy, it's Mike. I'll start. I'll go back to what we said at some point last year as a reference point, but obviously, there's multiple paths to get there depending on sort of the environment and what happens. But if you look at where we were talking about earlier in the call, you have the credit card business, you have the home lending business as those two things get to sort of more mature -- more mature return profile in the card business and we get to sort of the profitability improvement we want to see in home lending. You can make your own assumptions, but those two things alone probably get you pretty darn close. You can then look at growth we're getting in the investment bank in capital markets and wealth. And so, there's lots of different combinations that get you there. And that's why we feel very confident that we'll get to that 15% and then reasonable people can have different opinions on exactly what gets you there first. But I think there's multiple paths to get there. Charlie Scharf : Betsy, for a second, if I can. If you just look at what we've said for next year, right, we've given you an expense number in terms of what our expectations are, which are pretty close to what they are this year. And so, we've given you our NII guidance, which is also up from the prior year to make your own assumptions on credit and fee income and you'll get a sense for what we -- to your question if it's expenses or revenues, how we think we're going to get there. I mean in terms of what those dynamics look like. The one thing I just do want to say though, when we think about returns, we feel really great about the prospects here. But as I said, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We've been very, very careful to make sure that we've got the latitude to spend whatever it is we need on all of the risk and operational things. And so that's still the case. And so even though we feel great about the progress and I've tried to give an indication of how we feel about that. We have to maintain that flexibility because that is a gating factor and the top priority. The second thing is, we've been very careful not to provide multiyear guidance for expenses. And that's because as we continue to peel the sending back, we find opportunities. We tried to also lay out in the presentation the point that we're not just reducing expenses and funding inflationary increases across the place, we're increasing the level of investment in technology and other things. And as we look towards the success that we have in different parts of the Company as we invest. So, as we see the positive results, we want the ability to make those decisions at each point in time as to how much more we want to invest. So yes, if we didn't increase the level of investment or if we kind of cap that out, you could sit here and say, yes, lots of things -- margins we continue to expand, returns would expand, you could get to some pretty significant numbers. But we're building the Company for the future. And as long as we see the payoffs there, we want the latitude to do that. So, we're very conscious of what our investors expect from us. We're very conscious of what we think the franchise can produce, but we do intend to build both a higher returning at a higher growth franchise, and you're just starting to see that. And how that plays out from a timing perspective, that's what we're trying hard not to get boxed in on. Betsy Graseck : Totally get it, and it does feel like there's a bit of a shift at the margin to rev-led profitability growth, in my opinion, which is great, a lot of low-hanging fruits already out on the expense side. And then just lastly, on credit card. I understand get it more mature. There was the announcement during the quarter, I believe, that Ray Fischer is stepping down. Could you help us understand what drove that decisioning? And new -- yes, and new management and what I assume it's going to be the same goals and everything, but if we could just have a few thoughts on that whole situation? Thank you. Charlie Scharf : Yes, yes, yes. So, listen, Ray, I've known Ray a long time. We've worked together for many, many years. When I came to, Wells, literally, the -- I think it was the first or second day I was at Wells, the person who was running the card business told me that they had already accepted another job outside the Company. So, if that had nothing, I wasn't a part of that change. That was a decision that was made. And so, ask Ray to join us and he's done a fabulous job. Ray, I think -- I don't know his exact age. I want to say. Mike Santomassimo : We can give away his exact age, but he's old enough to deserve to retire. Yes. Very well, thank you, Mike. Charlie Scharf : Very well -- very well put. He's done a great job. And so, this is a very natural progression and something that we've talked about relative to his timing and what his expectations are. So, we've got a great team in place that he's built out. We've recruited a great leader from outside the Company, Ed Olebe, who joins us, I believe, sometime in February. And the strategy is the same, nothing is going to change. We've had lots of conversations about what we're doing and what the opportunities are. And I think I'm super excited about both what we've done, but continuing to execute along the lines that we've laid out for you all. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And you'll announce the new head when the time is appropriate, right? Mike Santomassimo : We have already -- we have Betsy, John will send you the press release. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. Thank you. Sorry about that. Charlie Scharf : I think we set it out. To be fair, we sent it out internally, and there was an article this past week pointing it out. Operator : The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Obviously, rate volatility is quite high here. So, how do we think about the rate sensitivity to your net interest income, if rates end up being a little bit higher, obviously, it seems like a structurally good, but help frame some of the sensitivity to the guidance that you put out there from changes in rates? Thanks. Mike Santomassimo : Yes, Matt. And obviously, we'll update the sensitivity in the Q or the K, I guess, when you get it. But we're still marginally asset-sensitive, as I said in my script. But the balance sheet has sort of naturally gotten less sensitive over the last number of quarters. So, rates coming down, as I said in the guidance is a slight headwind to sort of our estimates. And if they hold a little bit higher than what was in the forward, then I think that will be a slight positive. So obviously, we're a little -- we've become less rate sensitive over the last number of quarters, but it's still a little bit asset sensitive. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on trading, obviously, you guys have been executing really well for a few years now. And I don't want to make too much of just one quarter. But even if we strip out the fair value adjustment, the trading was still down year-over-year. Obviously, the peers are kind of implying up, I don't know, 15%, 20% plus just maybe talk a bit about was there anything unusual this quarter that fall weaker trading. And again, I appreciate last year was a strong quarter, but it did jump out. Mike Santomassimo : Yes. It was really about last year being a strong quarter than this year being a weak quarter. Nothing's changed. There's nothing abnormal underneath the surface. Nothing's changed in sort of our approach there. And obviously, the businesses are quite different when you look at peers. So, I do think you have to look through the results a little bit given the global nature and maybe the risk that some of the others take. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Actually, just on that last point. Obviously, we know you're more domestic, but your comment that others might take more risk. Like how do you think you're being more conservative in trading? Mike Santomassimo : Well, I just said you have to look at the risk they're taking. I'm not suggesting that I'm not going to -- I'm not trying to say anybody is taking more risk or not. But when you look at our business, we've been very, very disciplined about sort of the risk appetite that we have across the trading businesses. And much of the focus has been in places that are balance sheet friendly, like FX, given the asset cap and other areas. Charlie Scharf : What we're saying is just that the size of our business is materially smaller than the biggest folks out there. The complexity of the products is very, very different, both because of the global nature, but also some of the things we do. So, it's just that we just have a smaller, less complex business. Operator : The next question comes from David Long of Raymond James. Your line is open. David Long : As it relates to auto, just seems like a bit of a strategic shift after three years of seeing that portfolio decline. What are you seeing in that business that is increasing your appetite to grow it here forward? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. I wouldn't position it as a strategic shift. But a couple of years ago now, we took some tightening actions based on credit tightening act. There were two things going on. We took some credit tighten actioning tightening actions based on what we were seeing as what was happening in the market, and that had an impact on originations. We also saw some pretty significant spread compression at different points over the last couple of years. And so, our focus is not to be big. Our focus is to have a good returning sort of profitable business there. And so, we backed away in certain areas. I think over time, that starts to evolve and change and spread, we still -- these spreads are a little bit better than they were a couple of years ago in some pockets. And so that's part of it. Second, Charlie highlighted it as well. We are continuing to invest in the auto business. We've been continuing to build out better capabilities to be a little bit more of a full-spectrum lender across different pockets. That's a very small piece of what you're seeing in there. And then obviously, the deal we signed with Volkswagen and Audi, hasn't had any impact at this point. That will start to have a small impact as we get later in the year. And so, it's still relatively small growth in the originations. We're only talking a couple of billion year-on-year. And so, we'll see as it progresses throughout the year. David Long : Got it. And then the second question I had relates to the investment securities portfolio repositioning. And do you have certain internal payback maximum that you're willing to look at? Or do you need to have a gain elsewhere in the bank before you look to take a loss in making some adjustments? What is the thought process that you go through to get you to the decision to actually act? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Look, I think we've acted twice. We're in the third and the fourth quarter as we've sort of looked at different opportunities. We've been pretty disciplined about payback periods so far in total, it's roughly a 2- to 2.5-year payback period across both of the repositionings we've done. Could we do something has a longer payback period maybe, but it's something we'll continue to evaluate based on what we're seeing in the market. But so far, we've been pretty disciplined about when we do it. Operator : The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Mike, a follow-up for you on your guide for NII of plus 1% to plus 3% for 2025 full year. Can you give us the guide for NII ex-markets for 2025? Mike Santomassimo : Yes. Vivek, that's not something we've historically provided. Again, given the size of our markets business and the contribution, and obviously, it's very sensitive to where short rates will end up going. There is an improvement embedded in the guide for trading-related NII. That becomes -- that is very sensitive to where the -- where rates end up going. So, it's not something we're going to disaggregate at this point. Operator : The next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Charlie. Can you guys share with us, obviously, there's geopolitical risks all around. And I think many investors, obviously, are aware of those. Can you list for us the risks that you guys talk about outside of the geopolitical risk when you're running your business, what are the things -- because the outlook, I think we all share the optimism you and your peers for the upcoming year for banking? And what are the risks, though, that could maybe sort of a curve ball at us? Charlie Scharf : Well, the biggest risk that we have that we spend the most time talking about is cyber at this point, just away from the normal taking around credit, interest rate, operational risk, all the types of things you would talk about. And so -- which is why we spend so much time on that and have the level of investment that we have and put the resources into it. Listen, as I said, I think in my remarks, we feel optimistic about where we are going into 2025, both because of where the economy is and the strength that has existed as well as the business-friendly approach from the incoming administration. What can -- I mean, you know bad things can happen. It could be related to conflict, could be related to a surprise in the market. I mean those things are out there. We're prepared for them as we think about just the way we run the Company, but there's no one risk that sticks out relative to just the things that you would do relative to how you run the business. And the most important thing for us relative to just risk management and the performance of the Company away from these big tail risks is the strength of the U.S. economy. The strength of the U.S. economy will drive the levels of success for our customers, both on the consumer and the wholesale side. And then we follow from their success. So, anything that risks that is a risk for us. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. No, very clear. As a follow-up, and I apologize if this is putting the cart before the horse. You guys have obviously made great progress in resolving your regulatory issues. You talked on the call today about the OCC lifting, obviously the cease-and-desist order earlier last year. And so, when we get beyond these issues for you folks, obviously, everybody talks about the asset cap and the Federal Reserve\u2019s cease-and-desist order. Can we talk about strategic planning going forward in terms of how you might -- because you have plenty of excess capital, how you might consider acquisitions? And in particular, what I'm interested in is pre-pandemic and pre-year asset cap Wells deposit market share was over 10%, which as we all know, you're not -- no bank is permitted to buy a depository with the market share is over 10%. But now with the growth in the industry's deposits, you guys have been flat, you're below 10%. So, would there -- and again, I apologize if this is the cart before the horse, but is there any consideration once this is all behind you, as you guys look to grow through maybe acquisitions, depositories or investment banks? Or how are you guys looking at it from that standpoint? Mike Santomassimo : Gerard, it's Mike. Look, we're 100% focused on all of the organic growth opportunities we have across each of the businesses. And that's -- and the plan that we have been executing that Charlie started when he got here five years ago, is the same plan, we're going to be executing post asset cap. And I think it just involves basic execution across all the priorities, whether it's in card, wealth, IB, capital markets, et cetera, et cetera. And so that's our focus and -- because we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to build off of the positions, we have in each of these businesses across the country. Operator : And the last question for today's call will come from Saul Martinez of HSBC. Your line is open. Saul Martinez : You addressed -- in response to an earlier question, changes in the incentive framework across the branches. And there is this debate about the extent and how quickly an asset cap removal would kick start and allow for balance sheet growth. But I'm curious to hear if you think there are still operational/cultural constraints that you need to address to really capitalize on the growth opportunities across your businesses in response to the sales scandal, you changed the compensation structure of the branches. As you mentioned, you've built in safeguards to prevent abuses and maybe there is more of a cultural predilection to be more risk averse. But do you feel like these are factors you still need to address to sort of remove the shackles, create incentives that help you grow as you change more to a more of a growth mindset. If you could just maybe elaborate on those questions, please? Charlie Scharf : Yes. Let me take a shot at it. So, I think when we think about it is we are -- and we've been this way since I got here, which is very deliberate about how we go about business expansion. And whether it's an area like the card business where we started five years ago or the CIB, whether it's in trading or banking or in the private credit space that we're offering something in the direct lending world for our commercial. We do -- we're very focused on doing all of these in a very controlled way with the right risk framework and with all the right processes in place behind it. And so, I said in my remarks, we're not done yet in terms of all the things we have to deliver. But we are a very, very different company relative to the types of controls that exist today versus then. And so, it's having those controls in place. It's just doing the testing and seeing that they're actually effective is what gives us the confidence to grow. And so, when we talk about the opportunities that we have and the things that we're doing, it's because we have the confidence in those things that we put in place. So, when you talk about the shackles off and where we go, we just -- I mean, those aren't things that we talk about. Those aren't things that we think about. What we think about is that we are very disciplined in our approach in a very linear way towards where we are today versus where we want to go. And when we have the ability to grow the balance sheet from this point of view, we would expect to see the same. It's not -- we're not going to sit here and say the shackles are off. So therefore, the following 10 things are going to change materially. It's going to be disciplined, thoughtful piece by piece in a very controlled way and only in places that are supported by the controls that we have in place. Operator : Well, listen, everyone, thank you very much. We appreciate it, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Take care.",
