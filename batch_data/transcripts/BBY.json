Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co. David Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Bradley Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital Anthony Chukumba \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 12 p.m. Eastern Time today. (Operator Instructions) The call will end at 8.50 am Eastern Time. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference call over to Bill Seymour, Vice President of Investor Relations. Bill Seymour : Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our President and CEO and Sharon McCollam, CAO and CFO. As usual, the media will be participating in this call in a listen-only mode. This morning\u2019s conference call must be considered in conjunction with the press release that we issued earlier today. They both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-on-year comparisons, which should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for and should not be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful is discussed in the supplemental schedule in this morning\u2019s earnings release. Today\u2019s press release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial condition, results of operation, business initiatives, growth plans and prospects of the Company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company\u2019s current press release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. As a reminder, the first quarter of fiscal 2014 was the 13 week quarter versus 14 weeks in fiscal year 2013. The extra week in fiscal 2013 added approximately $735 million in revenue, including $660 million in domestic and $75 million in international and $0.12 in diluted EPS. It is also important to note that as a result of our previously announced definitive agreement to sell our 50% interest in Best Buy Europe, financial results for that business are now presented as discontinued operations in our financial statements. To assist investors with the financial modeling of this presentation, we have provided recast financial statements by quarter for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 on our Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin today with an overview of our first quarter results as well as an update of our Renew Blue priorities. Then I'll turn the call over to Sharon to provide further details. Before I do that, I would like to extend our thoughts and prayers to our teams and all of the people in Oklahoma City who have been affected by the tremendous devastation from the tornadoes yesterday. It is a terrible tragedy and our heartfelt sympathies and wishes our extended to all of them. At this moment, not all of our employees or employee families has been accounted for and remain in close contact with our regional leadership to ensure we're doing all that we can to support them in the moment of their greatness need and in the days and months ahead. In the first quarter, we continued to make substantial progress on our Renew Blue priorities. This progress included number one, driving a 16% increase in Domestic comparable online sales; number two, improving our customer Net Promoter Score by over 300 basis points; number three, reaching an agreement with Samsung to establish Samsung Experience Shops in our retail stores and beginning their roll out; number four, negotiating overall rent reductions for a number of our stores and closing one large format store; and number five, eliminating $175 million in annualized SG&A and supply chain costs in addition to $150 million last quarter. We also entered into a definitive agreement to sell our 50% interest in our European joint venture as announced last month. In addition, we reached an agreement with our founder and largest shareholder, Dick Shulze, to rejoin Best Buy as our Chairman Emeritus. Dick has been publicly support of Renew Blue and while he has decided not to rejoin our Board of Directors, we are thrilled and grateful to have his entrepreneurial mindset in these nearly five decades of experience available to us. We've also added three new Board members, each strengthening the Board with their important contributions. Russ Fradin, the President and CEO of SunGard is the newest member of our Board. Before taking the hand of SunGard, Russ was CEO of Aon Hewitt and brings substantial experience in operations and executive compensation to the Board. Also joining the Board are two individuals who know Best Buy well and together they bring decades of retail experience to Best Buy. Brad Anderson and Lenzmeier of course we're instrumental in growing Best Buy into the world's largest consumer electronics retailer and I speak for the entire Board when I welcome them back to Best Buy as directors. From a financial perspective during the quarter, while below last year we delivered better than expected results on both the top and bottom lines. On total company revenue from continuing operations of $9.4 billion which excludes Europe, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.32. Now that's important to eliminate any confusion, revenues including Europe would have been $10.8 billion and diluted earnings per share would have been $0.36. As expected, Domestic comparable store sales were down 1.1%, but this was driven by an 80 basis point impact from this year's Super Bowl shifting into last year's fourth quarter and a 30 basis point impact from our decision to reduce sales in certain non-core businesses. Excluding these impacts, Domestic comparable store sales were flat despite no new major product launches and late deliveries in the smartphone category. Impactful traffic generating and conversion initiatives with an increasing investment in price competitiveness drove the stronger than expected sales performance. Other performance for the quarter was driven by proactive solid execution and we continue to be encouraged by the intensity, collaboration and momentum that are Renew Blue priorities instilling into the organization. To build on this momentum, we\u2019re remaining focused on the two problems we have to solve, stabilizing and improving our comparable store sales and profitability across all types of our business. To solve these problems, we\u2019re continuing to focus on six Renew Blue priorities that we outlined for you last quarter. Number one, accelerating online growth; number two, escalating the multi-channel customer experience; number three, increasing revenue and gross profit per square foot to enhance store space optimization and merchandising; number four, driving down cost of goods sold to supply chain efficiencies; number five, continuing to gradually optimize the U.S. real estate portfolio and number six further reducing our SG&A costs. And I will now provide you with an update on each of these priorities. So to accelerate online growth, we\u2019re focusing on those initiatives that will drive increased traffic and conversion. In Q1, these initiatives included, number one, deploying best-in-class search engine marketing tools and correspondingly increasing our investment in paid search. Number two, expanding affiliate marketing and three adding dynamic product recommendation optionality to the checkout process to bring customers back into the shopping path. Collectively, these initiatives drove a 16% increase in domestic comparable online sales during the quarter. In Q2 initiatives to optimize our natural search or SEO ranking, are a top priority. These initiatives include redesigning certain aspects of the website, such as navigation, user interface and mobile and tablet experience, improving the quality structure and uniqueness of our content and enhancing our keyword in tag optimization. These SEO optimization initiatives are top priority because 80% of all customers who are planning to buy $100 plus hard line product in a retail store are researching the product online before going to the store and using the first page of search results to decide where they\u2019re going to buy it. That means that show rooming is not starting in our retail store, it is starting online and we\u2019re now showing up today on the first page, a fair share of the time. Also in Q2 to accelerate online growth, we\u2019re retiring our 10-year old onsite search platform and replacing it with new industry leading technology that will produce more relevant results based on the customer specific search criteria. We are creating a consistent customer experience across mobile, tablet, and PC devices including common navigation and product information. We are implementing technology enhancements that will make it easier to add Geek Squad Services to the shopping cart and we\u2019re adding functionality based on customer browsing behavior that will dynamically recommend products if no item has been added to the shopping cart. Then as we enter Q3 and holiday, we will begin migrating rewards on customers to a seamless sign on, we will enhance the in store pick up customer experience by creating an easier process for customers to add additional products and services to their basket when they arrive in the store and will add new marketplace partners to increase our online only product assortments. Now, well many of these online initiatives may sound like just basic functionality upgrades, they\u2019re actually game changing when online retailer of our size as we\u2019ve historically underinvested in the online channel. So, increasing our online investments and implementing these upgrades will significantly improve our online effectiveness and in some cases like in the area of onsite search take us to industry leading levels. The second Renew Blue priority for us this year is to escalate the multi-channel customer experience. Late last year we introduced a new metric to drive the customer experience known as Net Promoter Score, NPS. We use NPS to measure not only the satisfaction of customers who buy, but also the customers who don\u2019t. NPS here at Best Buy is tracked on a monthly basis for individual stores, the online channel in our service organization. It is also a key component of all corporate incentive plans from the Store Manager to the CEO. And since November, when we first began using NPS as a key performance indicator, we've increased our score by more than 300 basis points. We've also increased year-over-year in-store and online conversion rates. In addition to the rollout of NPS, we've also invested in two initiatives that we believe over time will have significant impact on our top and bottom lines in the customer experience. The first is our new low price guaranteed initiative that was launched in March as a follow-up program to our first quarter price match program. Another related opportunity to improve our price competitiveness was not in our control is of course sales tax liquidity in the online channel. By the end of this fiscal year, as most states implement their laws, Amazon.com will be collecting sales taxes in states that cover 50% of the U.S. population. And in states that are already collecting, we're seeing an incremental benefit in our online and retail store sales. The second initiative there is our buy online, ship from store initiative. This initiative is critical in resolving the number one customer [pinpoint] in our online channel which is product not in stock. Depending on the months, 2% to 4% of all of our online traffic does not buy because we do not have the inventory in our online distribution centers and we are telling them it is out of stock and yet, an estimated 80% of the time we're actually headed in one or more of our retail stores. So as this initiative progresses, we expect to gradually see an increase in online conversion, online sales and customer satisfaction. The most multi-channel retailers buy online, ship from store is a complex IT and operational undertaking, but we at Best Buy have actually already made a vast majority of the investment necessary to move this initiative forward over the next six to 12 months. This quarter we began piloting this initiative in 50 of our retail stores and if the pilot is successful, we will extend it to our new stores as necessary to fulfill online demand. And so buy online, ship from store and other significant operational benefits as well, it will allow us to improve our inventory management by helping us to more effectively manage new product inventory and more efficiently clear Returned, Open box and Clearance inventory in our stores by being able to display the return product on the web and be able to ship it out of the store when it was returned. The third Renew Blue priority is to increase revenue and gross profit per square foot to enhanced store space optimization and merchandizing. As I said last quarter, our plan this year to reduce space allocated to the negative growth and low margin CD and DVD categories and replace it with higher growth, higher margin categories like mobile, appliances and accessories while deepening strategic partnerships with key vendors. These changes are being made in two phases. In Phase 1 which is complete, we've opened 525 Samsung Experience Shops in our large format stores and 390 in our standalone mobile stores. In Phase 2 which is expected to complete by the end of the summer, we will open the remaining Samsung Experience Shops and complete the large format store space allocation initiative. Both of these are expected to enhance our forward profitability in our in-store consumer experience by increasing space in higher demand product categories, improving product adjacencies and offering more in-depth product knowledge. We are also taking a more holistic approach to managing Clearance inventory by creating dedicated clearance zones in selected stores and enabling customers to buy in-store clearance items for the online channel regardless of where the inventory is located. The fourth Renew Blue priority for this year is to drive down cost of goods sold through supply chain efficiencies. Our first supply chain initiative is to optimize our weaker store inventory replenishment model. In the first quarter, we have enhanced our algorithms to optimize our retail store delivery model for half of the U.S. which has resulted in the improved cubing of our [trucks] and a corresponding reduction in the number of loads and miles driven. The remainder of the U.S. will be addressed in the back half of the year. Our second supply chain initiative is to continue to expand our online delivery capability that we continue to grow the online business. To achieve this in time for holiday, we expect to extend our online fulfillment capabilities to our final three of eight distribution centers, and then reallocate the inventory to the distribution center closest to the customer. We are also rationalizing our population of supply chain vendors and working across the industry to further drive down cost and improve our overall distribution network management. Another supply chain priority is reverse logistics, which is actually one of the most financially punitive business processes in the Company. Customer returns, replacement and damages are approximately 10% of our revenue, and are costing the company over $400 million a year in P&L losses. To less these losses, as I mentioned earlier we are creating clearance zones in our stores and implementing buy online, ship from store capabilities for this merchandize. We\u2019re also implementing in-store procedures to ensure a greater level of diligence around the returns that are accepted from customers, and a high level of rigger around inventory that is then ultimately returned by the stores to our centralized return centers. Our sense of urgency around this initiative is extraordinarily high due to the substantial financial opportunity it represents. Based on the magnitude of this opportunity and the others we\u2019ve discussed, and you can see now why we are so confident in our Renew Blue commitment to reduce cost of goods sold by $325 million. To date we\u2019ve delivered $30 million and expect to deliver substantially more over the next several quarters. As this is an area that is such virtually every operating area in the company and carry a significant contractual commitments, progress will be gradual and incremental but substantial. Our six Renew Blue priorities to continue to gradually optimize our U.S. real estate portfolio, occupancy cost reduction and retail capital allocation remains a key focus. As such, during the quarter we renegotiated overall rent reductions for a number of our stores and closed one large-format store. As for new store openings, we\u2019re continuing to extend the timeframe by which we\u2019re measuring the performance of new prototype stores. This includes our Richfield prototype store in our Best Buy Mobile standalone stores, there are however a small number of select and opportunistic markets where we\u2019re moving forward with new store openings including 10 new Best Buy Mobile standalone stores that we\u2019re opening in Q1 and two additional Best Buy Mobile standalone stores that will be opened later this year. Our six Renew Blue priorities to further reduce the SG&A cost. As we laid out at our Analyst Day in November we believe there\u2019s an opportunity to remove $400 million in SG&A from our North American business and we\u2019re making substantial progress. In the first quarter we eliminated $135 million in annualized SG&A cost including $40 million in Canada, but in addition to the $150 million in annualized reductions we announced in March. This brings us to $295 million and we will take out additional cost as the year progresses. Moving to international; improving the performance of our international businesses is also one of the key priorities for us we announced last quarter and we\u2019re making progress there too. To this end as I said earlier we have agreed to sell 50% interest in Best Buy Europe to California warehouse. This transaction allows us to simplify our business to specially improve our return on invested capital which is one of the five priorities of our Renew Blue transformation and of course strengthen our balance sheet. We continue to expect that this transaction will close in June 2013. Also in international we\u2019re letting out our Renew Blue priorities this year to lead us in our international Renew Blue transformation we\u2019ve recently hired new leaders in both Canada and China. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to cover more details on our Q1 financial performance and our outlook for the year. Sharon. Sharon McCollam : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning everyone. Well non-GAAP financial results for the quarter were above expectation. They were also below last year. The highlights of the financial quarter were as follows. Enterprise revenue excluding the additional week last year declined 2.6% to $9.38 billion, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share declined to $0.32. These declines were primarily driven by a significantly greater investment in price competitiveness, and the year-over-year impact of high velocity product launches that occurred in the first quarter of last year that did not recur this year. These impacts were partially offset by the impact of companywide SG&A and cost containment initiatives. Domestic revenue, excluding the additional week last year, declined 2.2% to 7.98 billion. This decline was driven by the loss of revenue from 49 large format stores that were closed last year and a comparable store sales decline of 1.1% that Hubert described earlier. Domestic comparable online sales increased 16.3%. This increase was driven by higher traffic and higher conversion across all online platforms. From a merchandizing perspective, strong growth in mobile phones and appliances was more than offset by declines in home theater and gaming. International revenue, excluding the additional week last year and our European discontinued operations, declined 5.1% to 1.4 billion. This decline was primarily driven by the loss of revenue from 15 large format stores that were closed last year in Canada and a comparable store sales decline of 2.8%. Comparable store sales were negatively impacted by ongoing competitive pressure in Canada, partially offset by effective promotions that drove positive comparable store sales in China. Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise gross profit rate for the first quarter was 23.1% versus 24.9% last year, a decline of 180 basis points. If you exclude the additional week last year, the enterprise gross profit also declined 180 basis points. The Domestic gross profit rate was 23.4% versus 25.3% last year, a decline of 190 basis points. Excluding the additional week last year, the Domestic gross profit rate additionally declined 190 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by a greater investment and price competitiveness including higher promotional activity in mobile and computing, higher inventory shrinkage and increased product warranty-related costs. These impacts were partially offset by proceeds from legal settlements. The international gross profit rate was 21.3% versus 22.6% last year, a 130 basis point decline. Excluding the additional week last year, international gross profit also declined 130 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of China revenue that carries a lower gross profit rate and a more promotional environment in China. Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was 1.98 billion or 21.2% of revenue versus 21% last year, an increase of 20 basis points. Excluding the additional week last year, however, non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined 10 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was 1.64 billion or 20.6% of revenue versus 1.8 billion or 20.4% of revenue last year, an increase of 20 basis points. Excluding the additional week last year, domestic non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined 10 basis points again. This 10 basis point decline was primarily driven by lower payroll and incentive compensation costs and tighter expense management throughout the company. International non-GAAP SG&A expenses were 340 million or 24.3% of revenue versus 381 million or 24.6% of revenue last year, a decline of 30 basis points. Excluding the additional week last year, international non-GAAP SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue also declined 30 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by SG&A leverage in China. As we look forward to the second quarter, while not providing financial guidance we believe that the ongoing investment and price competitiveness that contributed to our gross profit and EPS declines in the first quarter will continue into the second quarter. Additionally, disruptions caused by the physical deployment of the Samsung Experience Shops and the optimization of our retail floor space are expected to have short-term operational impacts during the second quarter. We also expect to see a greater negative impact from our Renew Blue capital and SG&A investments in the second quarter in the areas of online, mobile, the multi-channel customer experience and the replatforming of bestbuy.com from which substantial financial benefits are not expected to be realized until fiscal \u201915 and beyond. These Renew Blue SG&A investments, however, are expected to be substantially offset, particularly in the back half of the year by the fiscal 2014 realization of our Renew Blue annualized cost reduction initiatives, including the $175 million be eliminated this quarter, the $150 million be eliminated in last quarter, and the additional reductions that we expect to announce over the balance of the year. As we sit here today, we\u2019re encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making against our Renew Blue priorities and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for the balance of the year. Our better than expected results in the first quarter, following our better than expected results from the fourth quarter, are reaffirming what you bear and I believe since the days we both join the Company, thus by is the market leader in a highly fragmented and growing market. We have a powerful platform from which to deliver a superior multi-channel shopping and service experience for our customers. We\u2019re already the 10th largest eCommerce retailer in the U.S., we\u2019re under penetrated from the market share perspective in early investment returns and the momentum we\u2019re seeing in the growth of the channel today validate the potential of this significant growth opportunity and the runway to improve financial returns through increased online growth, enhance retail execution and extensive structural cost is tremendous. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of David Schick with Stifel. Please go ahead. David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. It\u2019s Schick. Thank you. I guess, I would ask about, it seems like obviously the calendar of product cycle as you mentioned, and your competitors are talking about sort of these headwinds and retail overall as talked about it, quarter with some awful sentiment early in the quarter and [translator]. Would you agree talked about some of the pressures on the business in the first quarter? Would you agree that the product cycle should start to help you more and update on how you\u2019re thinking about that as the year plays out and probably the consumer as well? Hubert Joly : Good morning, David. Thank you for your question. I\u2019d say a couple of things. Yes, in Q1 the product cycle was at a bit lighter than last year and the rest of the year is more exciting. As the management team though, we\u2019re less focused on headwinds and more focused on what we can control. We continue to believe that our role in the market is large and growing and that we\u2019ve ample opportunities to impact our destiny from that standpoint. David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Peter Keith. Please go ahead. Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Little bit on the gross margin and the price competitiveness, and understand if anything changed from Q4 to Q1, it looks like the gross margin pressure intensified a little bit, was there more pressure in Q1 from the price match or would that price competitiveness you did call out mobile and computing, the last quarter you called out home theater, could you just provide a little more detail on what\u2019s going on there and kind of how we think about that trend going forward? Hubert Joly : Thank you, Peter. It\u2019s a good opportunity for us to clarify what\u2019s taking place. What we\u2019ve had really starting in Q4, is greater investment as part of the Company to strengthen its price competitiveness, that\u2019s independent from the price match policy. Meaning we\u2019ve ensured that our prices are more competitive that we\u2019ve enhanced our price competitiveness in the marketplace. The cost of the price matching is eventually quite low for two reasons. One, our price is actually now quite competitive. Indeed the frequency of the price matching is actually low, but the price matching policy and tool as done notably has enhanced the confidence of our Blue Shirt as they work with the customers to understand and even then close the sale. We've eliminated any obstacle to this. So the impact from the gross profit margin to retail is primarily coming from the greater investments starting in Q4 of last year into our price competitiveness. Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Okay, very helpful. Thank you very much. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Peter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead. David Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC: Thank you very much. I want to change the topic a little bit and talk about Samsung. I guess it's in, I don't know how many stores, over 500 maybe not quite 1,000 yet. When you look at that, what has been \u2013 has there been anything that really has jumped out at you to-date either positive or negative about this strategy and about having those stores in there? And as you sort of look at it, do you think there's opportunity for other brands to do similar type things? And I guess the last one maybe a little sensitive as part of this is \u2013 as you look at where it's been placed in the store \u2013 front center in a store, have you heard anything from other vendors as far as complains that maybe Samsung's getting too much visibility inside the store being placed so well and so prominently in the store? Thank you. Hubert Joly : Good morning, David. Thank you for your question. I think that the one thing that struck me the most over the last several months is the feedback from many, many of our vendors about how valuable distribution capability is, of course in the store as well as online, in many ways making our real estates in their eyes and assets rather than the liability quite frankly. So specifically as we did to Samsung, what's really positive is the customer experience. These vendors invest billions of dollars in R&D to develop these great products and showcasing the experience, the functionalities and the experience of the individual products as well across products is very challenging if you don't have the space and the available advice. And Best Buy is very unique today in providing the opportunity to do just that. So the customer experience is just terrific. The feedback we're getting from customers is very positive, including in that \u2013 related to your second and third question, because customers can now look at the Samsung set of products and customer experiences as well as other competing universes and ecosystem that some people call these things. So this is a very positive thing. If anything the announcement of Samsung and the deployment of Samsung has triggered more competitions with other vendors who are agreeing that this is a very positive. And the more traffic is attracted to our stores, the better this is for everybody. So there will be more \u2013 there's nothing to talk about today, but we are interested in doing more and we see it as win-win-win. It's winning for the customers, it's winning for the vendors and it's winning for Best Buy. So this is exciting. David Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott, LLC: Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co.: Hi, good morning. So my question's on, I guess, recent sales trends. A competitive of yours last night, a smaller regional competitor, when they report their quarterly results talked very clearly about a pickup in sales trends throughout this year and in particularly the recent month or so. They didn't specify specifically between consumer electronics and appliances, but are you seeing is Best Buy seeing that in your business as well? Hubert Joly : Brian, so your question is, are we seeing an acceleration of trends from a market standpoint? I personally find that months to months it's going to be hard to track because there is so much noise in the system really to new product introductions. The governing start we have Brian is that we see the market as being a large growing market, in that the \u2013 if anything, the next few months and quarters we\u2019ll see a number of exciting new product introductions that will help the market. This is one of the extraordinary things about this industry is that new products keep coming up. And of course we don\u2019t do so well in VCRs anymore, so you have to be focused on the new categories, but so yes we see a positive environment, a very competitive environment as well but we don\u2019t want to give the impression of the rosy picture, but one where we have a very fair opportunity to compete and drive for stabilize and then begin increasing comps which is in our profitability, which has been our theme since November. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Bradley Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about the opportunity to improve cost of goods sold. You guys have been very clear about the savings that you\u2019ve realized on the SG&A side of things. You\u2019ve also mentioned I believe it was $30 million you\u2019ve seen already on the cost of good sold side. Could you sub quantify for us maybe what that run rate is today and the timing with which you could start to see more benefits on that side of the equation? Hubert Joly : Hey Sharon, would you like to take this? Sharon McCollam : Absolutely. Yes, Brad I\u2019d be happy to. The cost of goods opportunity is actually one of the most compelling cost reduction opportunities that we have in the company right now. And in Hubert\u2019s prepared remarks he talked about the biggest of those opportunities which is this returns replacement and damages. Today the reverse logistics process in the company is resulting in a business model that is loosing well over $400 million a year on a revenue base, reverse logistics revenue base returned from customers above $3.5 billion. Well that\u2019s why he\u2019s focused on a lot of things over the years. This particular area is one where it has received virtually no focused attention on as the company had been growing and growing the reverse logistics side of it are not obviously the primary focus. But today it is our number one priority to address this. So, when we look at that we\u2019ve quantified that for you clearly, you\u2019ve got to get your arms around what portion of those losses you can effectively go after, but it is clearly a substantial opportunity and Hubert even went on to point out that because of the magnitude of this challenge the confidence that we have in achieving that is extraordinarily high. The other place in the supply chain that we have significant opportunity is in the optimization of our shipping lanes. We again have opportunity through systems enhancements and other areas to be able to further cube out our retail replenishment model which is a substantial cost when you think about our cube. Another area that we are aggressively going after is the vendor selection -- vendor management aspect of supply chain and that is an area again where there has been less focus in some of the other areas in the company. So collectively when you look at that and you think about what we shipped here between the flash drives and the flat screen it is a very large cubic endeavor. So, going forward now let\u2019s talk about how you\u2019ll get there, and I think in your question, that you\u2019re looking at the SG&A and saying we\u2019ve taken out substantially more SG&A than we have cost of goods. When you\u2019re talking about the supply chain, what you need to be thinking about is a gradual and incremental ongoing improvement in the process. Remember the supply chain touches every operational activity that we have in the company, and a lot of that business is contractually committed at any point in time. So in order to make progress on that you have to work through those contractual obligations. So what you need to expect from us every single quarter is as just as we said with SG&A is a consistent and gradual recovery of this tremendous amount of costs, but there is nothing structural in the company right now that would indicate anything other than this is all about execution and going to get it. Bradley Thomas - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thank you, Sharon. Thank you, Hubert. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Please go ahead. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : Thank you very much. My question will focus on the SG&A side of the cost reduction efforts. In only six months you have very admirably realized about 75% of the targeted SG&A reductions. I was wondering if the opportunity exists for those reductions to actually be over and above the 400 million. The second question, if I may, is with the disposition of Europe and it seems like for now, you're suddenly committed to China. I know up to now, you've been reluctant to talk about the cost reduction opportunities on the international front, but Hubert or Sharon, can you maybe just address what you think those opportunities could be? Hubert Joly : Hi, Alan. Thank you for your very kind comments. As Sharon who of course is leading our work on SG&A to answer your question. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : Thank you. Sharon McCollam : Alan, our $400 million target I believe is one that just like I just explained on the cost of goods side is evident and extremely achievable. As Hubert and I learn more and more about the organization and quite frankly what I would tell you is when you look at the results even of the first quarter, this has become an organizational mission on SG&A. The results that we delivered this quarter were as the collected efforts of this entire organization and the leaders in Best Buy have embraced these initiatives at a level that you could only hope you could accomplish in such a short period of time. So while I am extraordinarily encouraged about the potential, today when I get the 400, I'll start talking to you about bigger numbers. But what I can tell you is that we see nothing that says that you don't put that 400 in the bank \u2013 that 400 million in the bank over time. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : Okay. Thank you, Sharon. And on the international cost reduction opportunity\u2026? Sharon McCollam : On the international side, I would say that we are in early innings. Hubert mentioned in his prepared remarks that Canada did take out $40 million of SG&A in the first quarter but as we've discussed in previous calls and continues to discuss, we have only just begun to instill our Renew Blue priorities in our Canadian and China businesses. So I believe that that opportunity continues to be significant as well. And as we get more deeply into it, of course we'll continue to communicate on our progress there. We have two extraordinarily wonderful new leaders, one in Canada and one in China and they have come in blazing. And I think that they are going to lay the foundation for very similar progress against Renew Blue that we are seeing here in the U.S. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : Okay. Thank you very much. Bill Seymour : Last question please, operator. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Anthony Chukumba \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets : Good morning. Just had a quick question, just want to kind of circle back to the price investment. Would you say that those are largely behind the company or should we expect some additional level of price investments going forward? Thanks. Hubert Joly : Anthony, thank you so much for your questions and your continued support. Your question is do we plan to expand the investments. Similarly, we say we plan to maintain the investments. We feel that being competitive, price competitive is of utmost importance at this particular time. It's possible that we will selectively increase the investments as we look ahead. And as we \u2013 I think there's going to be a balancing act from between these price investments and then the capture of the cost of goods sold \u2013 cost reduction opportunities that Sharon highlighted. So I\u2019m not giving you very specific guidance, but rather a general sense of direction of the importance we place on these investments and also the fiscal responsibility we feel to over time balance this. So, I think as we look at having the next quarter\u2019s we will continue to update you of course on this, but count on us to be in there fighting to attract and keep customers. Sharon McCollam : And I will just add to that Anthony, that the one area that we\u2019ll add to the margin impact of the investments that we\u2019re making in price will be the optimization of our footprints in our retail stores and focusing on balancing that mix along with all the other initiatives that Hubert is talking about. By the end of the summer, we\u2019re going to be complete with our first phase of the floor space optimization and of course once we made those changes we\u2019ll be treating that going forward and we think that is a very important opportunity for us as we focus on the balance that Hubert mentioned between the investments in price and the optimization of our margin while having to invest in price. Hubert Joly : So, altogether as we ramp this conference call, first of all, I wanted to thank you for your attention and your support. I want to convey the fact that these continue to be very exciting times for Best Buy. We feel very encouraged by the actions we\u2019ve been taking in this quarter, the opportunities we have that I think we tried to detail on the call today as we look ahead and the early results in our efforts to stabilize and begin improving the performance of the business. So, these are very intensive and exciting times for us and we look forward to continued dialogues. So, Bill over back to you. Bill Seymour : Yep. That\u2019s the end of the call operator. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes the first quarter Best Buy earnings conference call.

[Operator instructions.] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 12 p.m. Eastern Time today. (Operator Instructions) The call will end at 8.50 am Eastern Time. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference call over to Bill Seymour, vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir. Bill Seymour : Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our president and CEO and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. As usual, the media will be participating in this call in a listen-only mode. This morning\u2019s conference call must be considered in conjunction with the press release that we issued earlier today. They both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-on-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for, and should not be read in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s release. Today\u2019s press release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial condition, results of operation, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments, and prospects of the company, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company\u2019s current press release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I would like to highlight that during our second quarter we reached settlements with multiple defendants under which we will receive a total of $229 million net of litigation costs. These settlements were the result of a lawsuit filed by the company as disclosed in our most recent form 10-Q that alleges price fixing by certain manufacturers of TST LCD panels from 1998 to 2006. We have excluded the impact of the settlements reached during Q2 FY14, and our non-GAAP financial results provide meaningful comparisons versus last year. And where applicable we will be referring to those non-GAAP results in this morning\u2019s call. Again, complete information regarding our GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in this morning\u2019s release. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Bill, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I\u2019d like to begin today with an overview of our second quarter results, as well as an update on our Renew Blue priorities. Then I will turn the call over to Sharon to provide further details. Before I do that, I\u2019d like to welcome Chris Askew, our new president of services, to our One Best Buy team, as we focus on strengthening one of our greatest competitive advantages, our network of 20,000 Geek Squad agents and the service they provide to our customers. Chris joins us with a strong track record in managing large, complex services organizations, including at NCR, Dell, and Lenovo. We\u2019re thrilled to have him on board, and excited about reinvigorating this growth engine within the company. Now let me come back to our second quarter results. In November of last year, at our investor meeting, we talked about the two problems we had to solve : declining comparable store sales, and declining operating margins. Since that time, the resolution of these two problems has become our Renew Blue rallying cry, and the organization\u2019s goals and objectives as we prioritize accordingly. While we are clear that there\u2019s much more work ahead, we have made measurable progress since we unveiled Renew Blue last year, including near-flat comparable store sales, substantial cost take outs, and better than expected earnings in the past three consecutive quarters. From a financial perspective, we delivered better than expected results on both the top and bottom lines during this last quarter. On total company revenue from continuing operations of $9.3 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.32. As expected, domestic comparable store sales were down 0.4%. This was driven by short term disruptions caused by the retail deployments of the Samsung Experience shops, Windows stores, and floor space optimization, as well as our continued rationalization of noncore businesses. Excluding these impacts, domestic comparable store sales were flat to slightly positive for the quarter. During the second quarter, we continued to make substantial progress on our Renew Blue priorities. This progress included, number one, driving a more than 10% increase in domestic comparable online sales; number two, improving our net [unintelligible] score; number three, enriching our retail customer experience for the rollout of our Samsung Experience shops in Windows stores; number four, piloting our buy online, ship from store initiative in 50 stores; and number five, eliminating an additional $65 million in annualized costs, bringing our nine-month total of annualized cost reductions to $390 million toward our target of $725 million. We also continued to focus on the six Renew Blue priorities that we outlined for you at the beginning of the year. Number one, accelerating online growth; number two, accelerating the multichannel customer experience; number three, increasing revenue and gross profit per square foot to enhance store space optimization and merchandising; number four, driving down cost of goods sold for supply chain efficiencies; number five, continuing to gradually optimize the U.S. real estate portfolio; and number six, further reducing SG&A costs. I will now provide you an update on each of these priorities. To accelerate online growth, we\u2019re continuing to focus on those initiatives that are designed to drive and improve customer experience, increase traffic, and higher conversion. In Q2, these initiatives, including the replacement of our 10-year-old onsite search platform, the dynamic creation of product recommendations for browsing customers with empty carts, the easier attachment of Geek Squad services, and the implementation of a richer tablet shopping experience. We also implemented the dynamic creation of location-specific product offers and have begun a campaign to drive the quantity and quality of customer product reviews. Product reviews are a powerful tool to drive conversion and based on our year to date run rate, we expect to quadruple the number of reviews we have on our site by year-end. Including all of these initiatives, our domestic online channel delivered a 10.5% comparable store sales increase in the quarter, excluding the preorders of new gaming consoles. Including these preorders, which we do not expect to ship or recognize as revenue until Q4 of fiscal \u201914, comparable online demand increased over 16%. Now, there\u2019s still significant growth to be done on the site. Our next phase of initiatives as we head into the holiday season includes, number one, the optimization of site navigation, including the rapid narrowing of search results through drop-down editing; number two, the implementation of single-site sign on for Reward Zone customers; number three, the online display of all in-store clearance and open-box inventory; number four, the introduction of new product buying guides; number five, the addition of new marketplace partners to increase our online-only product assortment; and number six, the enhancement of our buy online, pick up in store experience by creating an easier process for customers to add service plans to their final purchase upon arrival in the store. From all of these online initiatives, over time we expect to see measurable improvements in the customer experience, natural and on-site search, and conversion. The second Renew Blue priority for this year is to escalate the multichannel customer experience. We use NPS, or Net Promoter Score, to measure not only the satisfaction of customers that buy, but also the customers that don\u2019t. In the second quarter, our NPS score improved by approximately 300 basis points year over year. While we know there\u2019s still much to do here to provide a consistently great customer experience across all of our channels, we were very pleased to see that the service provided by our blue shirts in the stores was not only a key contributor to our year over year improvements in our NPS score, but also to our improved in-store close rates during the quarter. In addition to the rollout of NPS, there are three customer experience initiatives that we believe will have a significant benefit on both the top and bottom lines. The first of these initiatives relates to our price competitiveness. Price competitiveness is [table stakes]. During Q2, and heading into the back half of the year, we\u2019re continuing to invest in our price competitiveness when needed for price matching and price reductions. Pricing is the capability that is underdeveloped at Best Buy, an area that we will be making greater investments in and increasing our focus on over the next several quarters through improved analytics. The next customer experience initiative relates to retail leadership performance. Plain and simple, a great store requires great leadership. To this end, we have implemented a more rigorous and consistent performance management approach that measures not only the financial metrics but also customer satisfaction metrics like store level NPS to drive improved retail leadership performance. Although we are only in our rollout, this [rigor] is creating a new level of visibility, ownership, intensity, and accountability that we believe over time will help drive an improved in-store customer experience. The third customer experience initiative is buy online, ship in store. As we mentioned last quarter, there are numerous reasons that we believe this initiative is going to have significant customer experience and financial benefits when rolled out at scale, including, number one, improving our online conversion, which is currently well below many other retailers; number two, more profitably selling returns and clearance inventory that is trapped in our stores; number three, reducing mark down risk on product transitions; number four, improving inventory management by increasing visibility to true multichannel customer demand; and number five, enabling more accurate demand planning. To put this opportunity into context today, 2-4% of our online traffic in any given week does not buy, because we do not have the inventory in our online distribution centers and we\u2019re telling the customer that it is out of stock. And yet much of the time we actually have it in one or more of our retail stores. But today, in our 50-store pilot, we are seeing examples of these customer service and financial benefits, including a 90-basis point average lift in July comps for those 50 stores, and half of the units sold being either transition or closeout SKUs that were sold at higher margins than the stores outside the pilot. Based on these encouraging results, and the successful implementation of the IT requirements to do so, we plan to extend the ship from store pilot to over 200 stores in time for holiday. The third Renew Blue priority is to increase revenue and gross profit per square foot, to enhance floor space optimization and merchandising. During the second quarter, we continued our floor space optimization efforts, which included the deployment of the Samsung Experience shops, the rollout of the Windows stores, the increase in space dedicated to growing and profitable categories like mobile, tablet, and small appliances, and the creation of new clearance areas that offer clearance, returns, and open box items. Today we are largely done with the deployment of the Samsung Experience shops. They are now in almost all of our large format and mobile stores. In June, we announced our agreements with Microsoft and began to roll out the Windows stores in 500 of our large format stores. As of the end of the second quarter, we had deployed 240 Windows stores and expect to be done with the rest by the end of September. There will also be additional existing category optimization efforts that will continue into October. You should note that the deployment of the Windows stores and other aspects of this project are more disruptive than the initial work on the Samsung Experience shops. Nevertheless, while this is very early in the deployment of the Samsung and Windows stores, the customer feedback on both has been very positive. The fourth Renew Blue priority for this year is to drive down cost of goods sold through supply chain efficiencies and reverse logistics. In the second quarter, we completed the rollout of our enhanced retail store inventory replenishment model and continue to rationalize our network of supply chain vendors through service level benchmarking and competitive bidding processes. From these initiatives we have begun to see lower retail store replenishment costs, lower transportation costs, and improved service levels to our customers. In the third quarter, we will complete the expansion of our online fulfillment capabilities to our final three of our eight distribution centers and begin allocating inventory to the distribution center closest to the customer to improve the time and cost of delivery. Reverse logistics has been another top supply chain priority. As we discussed last quarter, customer returns, replacements, and damages are approximately 10% of revenue and are costing the company over $400 million a year in P&L losses. Based on the steps we are taking, we feel confident that we can meaningfully reduce these assets. Actions we are taking include making this inventory more visible and easily purchased by customers by leveraging store clearance area and the ship from store pilot I talked about earlier. It also includes improving the shopping experience for buying online clearance items through better site design, assortment, and clearance pricing, and includes expanding clearance pricing to more core categories and to open box products. Based on the magnitude of the returns, replacements, and damages opportunity, and the other supply chain opportunities we have discussed, we continue to be confident in our Renew Blue commitment to reduce cost of goods sold by $325 million. To date, we\u2019ve delivered over $65 million in annualized savings and expect to deliver substantially more over the next several quarters. Our fifth Renew Blue priority is to continue to gradually optimize our U.S. real estate portfolio. Occupancy cost reduction and retail capital allocation remain a key focus. As such, during the quarter we renegotiated overall rent reductions for a number of stores and closed three mobile stores at lease expiration. In parallel, we\u2019re continuing with a number of new store within a store openings before the end of the quarter, including five Magnolia Design Centers and 12 Pacific Kitchen and Home stores within a store. These concepts provide a higher end and higher touch customer experience, and have tested well in 28 and 55 stores, respectively. Our sixth Renew Blue priority is to further reduce SG&A costs. As we laid out at our investor meeting last November, we believe there is an opportunity to remove $400 million in SG&A from our North American business and we\u2019re making substantial progress. Since the company\u2019s last earnings release, we have eliminated an additional $30 million in annualized SG&A costs, and this brings us to $325 million and we plan to take out additional costs as the year progresses. In addition to our activities in the U.S., we are continuing to roll out Renew Blue in our international business, and are excited about the new focus we have in place in Canada and China. And I will now turn the call over to Sharon to cover more details on our second quarter financial performance and our outlook for the year. Sharon McCollam Thank you, Hubert, and good morning everyone. Like Hubert, I would like to echo how encouraged we are by the progress we are making against Renew Blue priorities, as demonstrated by our second quarter results. The financial highlights of the quarter were as follows. Enterprise revenue for the second quarter declined 0.4% to $9.3 billion, and non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 23.1% to $0.32. This EPS increase was primarily driven by strong expense management and Renew Blue cost savings, partially offset by higher year over year investments and price competitiveness. Domestic revenue of $7.8 billion increased 0.1%. This increase was primarily driven by incremental revenue from 57 net new Best Buy mobile stores, partially offset by a comparable store sales decline of 0.4%. Excluding the disruptive comparable store sales impact that Hubert discussed earlier, though, domestic comparable store sales were flat to slightly positive for the quarter. Domestic online comparable revenue increased 10.5%, due to increased traffic and a higher average order value, including gaming preorders\u2019 comparable online demand increase over 16%. From a merchandising perspective, strong growth in mobile phones and appliances was partially offset by declines in other categories, including gaming and digital imaging. Of note, comparable store sales for the television category were flat in the quarter, which is considerably better than the trend we\u2019ve seen over the last few years. International revenue of $1.5 billion declined 2.9%. This decline was due to the loss of revenue from 15 large format stores that were closed in Canada last year, and a comparable store sales decline of 1.8% driven by lower demand for consumer electronics and ongoing competitive pressure in Canada, partially offset by increased consumer demand in China due to expiring government subsidies that were supported by increased promotional offers. Turning now to the gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the second quarter was 23.7% versus 24.2% last year, a decline of 50 basis points. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate was 24% versus 24.3% last year, a decline of 30 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by increased product warranty related costs associated with higher claims frequency in the mobile category and a greater investment in price competitiveness, particularly in appliances and mobile. These impacts were partially offset, however, by improved overall product mix and the accelerated recognition of previously deferred revenue associated with our Capital One credit card portfolio that will be sold to Citibank in the third quarter. The international gross profit rate was 22.3%, versus 23.8% last year, a decline of 150 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of China revenue that carries a lower gross profit rate and higher promotional activity in China. Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $2 billion, or 21.5% of revenue, versus 22.3% last year, a decline of 80 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $1.67 billion, or 21.3% of revenue, versus $1.72 billion, or 22.1% of revenue last year, a decline of 80 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by strong expense management, Renew blue cost savings, and the impact of Q2 fiscal year \u201913 store closures. These reductions were partially offset by our Renew Blue investments in the optimization of our retail floor space and the replatforming of bestbuy.com. International non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $332 million, or 22.3% of revenues, versus $359 million, or 23.4% of revenue last year. This 110 basis point rate decline was primarily driven by a higher mix of China revenue which carries a lower SG&A rate and cost reductions in Canada and China. From a working capital perspective, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents increased $1.3 billion to $1.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by the sale of Best Buy Europe and proactive working capital management. Receivables increased $290 million, or 32.3% to $1.2 billion, primarily due to the LCD settlement and the remaining receivable on the sale of Best Buy Europe. During the quarter, we received approximately $30 million in cash of a total $229 million LCD settlement, with the balance to be received in installments over the next eight quarters. Merchandise inventories increased $399 million, or 6.8%, to $5.4 billion, primarily due to aggressive inventory management and an ongoing reduction in clearance inventory. Accounts payable decreased $362 million, or 6.8%, to $5 billion, primarily due to lower inventory purchases. As a percentage of inventory, accounts payable remained flat year over year. The current portion of long term debt decreased $495 million to $44 million, due to the issuance of a new 5%, 5-year, $500 million bond, which replaced a 6.75% $500 million bond that matured in July. As we now look forward to the back half of the year, it goes without saying that we are encouraged by the momentum that we are seeing from our Renew Blue priorities and excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. But to build on this momentum, and to position us for a strong fiscal 2015, we have to continue to invest in those initiatives that are driving our success today. As such, our investment plans for the balance of the year now include a greater Q3 and Q4 investment in price competitiveness in addition to our previously announced $150 million to $200 million investment in incremental SG&A to support the Renew Blue priorities Hubert discussed earlier in the call and that are outlined in today\u2019s press release. In addition to these investments, though, there are two additional back half impacts that are not investments, but that we would like to discuss. The first is a temporary increase in our mobile warranty costs that is expected to continue through the first quarter of fiscal 2015. This increase is considered temporary because it relates to higher claims frequency on our legacy Geek Squad protection programs that will expire or be operationally restructured out over the next several quarters. The second is a change in the economics of our private label credit card program that is being sold by Capital One to Citibank in the third quarter. This impact is due to the expiration of our previous credit card agreement with Capital One, which offered Best Buy substantially better financial terms than what is commercially available in the market today due to changes in both the regulatory environment and the general consumer credit market overall. To partially offset the investments and increase operational costs, however, we expect to see a positive financial benefit from our year to date $390 million in annualized Renew Blue cost savings in addition to the further savings that we are expecting to deliver in the third and fourth quarters. So while it was not our intent today to provide comprehensive financial guidance on the total company P&L for Q3 or Q4, or fiscal 2015, we recognize that it would be difficult for our investors to estimate the potential magnitude of these investments and increased operational costs without further context. We also recognize that having a financial estimate from us, particularly in light of our transformation, was important to understanding and accurately projecting future results. Therefore, to assist our investors with these future projections, in our release this morning we provided our latest quarterly estimate of the year over year basis point impact of these factors on the total company operating income rate. These estimates reflect the net sum of the three P&L drivers we just discussed, the negative impact of the pricing and SG&A investments, the increased operational costs, and the positive impact of the Renew Blue cost savings. For the third and fourth quarters, these estimates were as follows : negative 90-110 basis points in Q3, and negative 40-70 basis points in Q4. While I will not discuss them now, continuing impacts into fiscal 2015 are also outlined in this morning\u2019s release. Again, these basis point estimates on the operating income rate only pertain to the specific P&L drivers I just outlined, and should not be used or interpreted in isolation as a calculated projection of our expected year over year change in the total company operating income rate, because as we have seen in the last three quarters, our core business performance is stabilizing, and our product mix and cost containment initiatives above and beyond our Renew Blue cost average have been stronger than expected. As such, we expect that through continued improvement in our core business performance we will be able to offset some or all of these impacts. Thank you, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Our first question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew Fassler : My question relates to the impact of the credit card item on gross margin in the second quarter. I guess it\u2019s a quick two-part question. The first part is can you tell us how much that aided gross margin here in Q2? And secondly, does that reflect any kind of change in the net economics of that deal? Or just some acceleration of the [pad] that you would have ultimately received? Sharon McCollam : That was an acceleration of the payout that we would have received because the accounting requires that you book those bounties over time. As far as quantifying the amount, we obviously have confidentiality agreements, so I\u2019m not going to go there. But let me just give you one other piece of information. When you look at the gross profit this quarter, again, we have two offsetting items. We have the credit card income, but the offset is this Geek Squad protection warranty negative. And quite frankly, they virtually net each other out. So the margin that you\u2019re looking at is very clean. There\u2019s two specific items within it, but net, when you\u2019re looking at the actual number that we reported, it\u2019s very clean. Matthew Fassler : So any gross margin discussions that anyone would have had a quarter ago, this 24.0% domestic would essentially be, on those same terms the other stuff cancels out? Sharon McCollam : That\u2019s right, and the reason for that versus last quarter is very much driven by mix. We talked about the product mix and this quarter we had very strong growth in the mobile and the appliance businesses, and with that comes a rate mix benefit. Operator : Our next question is from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Gary Balter : I\u2019m just going to focus on the online. You mentioned the 50-store test that you\u2019re doing. What\u2019s different in that in terms of the pickup at store? Because right now when I go on, you see like 6-7 day delivery if you want to buy it at the stores, this next day pickup. And as part of that, given the success that you\u2019re having with it, why not roll it out faster? Sharon McCollam : The buy online ship from store is invisible to the customer. Historically, as Hubert laid out in his prepared remarks, 2-4% every week of our customers come to bestbuy.com and ask to buy something, and because it is not in the online distribution center, we tell them that we do not have it. And yet much of the time, we have it in one or more stores. So, by opening up those 50 stores, what happens is that when the system checks the online DC, and does not find the inventory, it then checks those 50 stores, and if that inventory is there, it fills the order, completely invisible to the customer. In last quarter\u2019s call, we talked about the reason that we were going to roll 200 stores for holiday, and why we haven\u2019t rolled sooner, we had two systems issues to solve. Remember, we have never shipped out of the back room of the store, so this is a very different process. The good news, that you just pointed out, is that the store associate has already learned by buy online pick up in store how to have a pick ticket dropped to the floor and to be able to pick the order and put it in the basket. Now, the next phase of that is to put it in a box, create a shipping label for UPS, and have it distributed. The system had two enhancements that had to be made. The first is that because we had never shipped out of a store, we were not able to populate the UPS label, with shipping. So the back room associate is actually having to take the pick ticket and type in the address. This is a very simple IT fix, and not the one that is the bigger of the two that\u2019s caused us to push to 200 stores for holiday and then to open it up next year to a greater number of stores. The second one is the fact that in our system - and this is very common in retailers - when inventory is actually sold, it takes up to 4 hours to be able to update the inventory. And what we are working on today is the problem with that is during peak times it is very possible, if you only had two of an item left in a store, that you\u2019re going to go ahead and promise it to that customer and you may sell it in that 4-hour period. So we were not comfortable rolling this, because this is such a big NPS issue for the customer, that we had to get that timeframe down to 15 minutes before we were comfortable rolling it out. And that is what we will have achieved by the time we roll this with the 200 stores before holiday. Operator : Your next question is from Anthony Chukumba with BBT Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Anthony Chukumba : My question was actually related to your balance sheet. You got the money from Carphone Warehouse. You essentially refinanced on the debt, saved 175 basis points. You\u2019re now going to be getting this money from the LCD settlement. How do you think about starting to buy back stock? I understand why you stopped doing it last year, the numbers just continued to get worse, and there was a lot of uncertainty, but given the fact that it looks like things are on the right track, and your balance sheet is just so strong, how do you sort of think about that? Hubert Joly : We believe that having a strong balance sheet is a very important factor for our success. And in fact, when we look at a lot of our competitors and other players that do have very strong balance sheet, and so do a lot of our vendors, having a strong balance sheet is very helpful to us as we negotiate with our vendors. You always want to be negotiating from a position of strength. So we have this as a governing thought to have a very strong balance sheet as we operate the business. For now, this is how we think about it. I don\u2019t know, Sharon, do you want to add anything to this? Sharon McCollam : No, I couldn\u2019t have articulated it better. Operator : And our next question is from David Gober with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. David Gober : Just one quick clarification on the credit card agreement. I know you said it didn\u2019t have any impact on the gross margins, but given that there is a recognition of deferred revenue, did that have any impact on top line? And then just a follow up on the commentary on the TV business, definitely interesting to hear that that has flattened out after a sustained period of more difficult trends. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing there, in terms of whether it\u2019s screen sizes or different technologies, what do you think is actually driving that? Or is it just a function of the more competitive pricing that\u2019s been in the market. Sharon McCollam : I\u2019ll take the question on the credit card. Obviously you completely understand the accounting for these credit card bounties. They do go into revenue. This is completely immaterial to our revenue. So it is not a huge number. It had the gross margin impact, which I answered the question on gross margin. It has an offset on the product warranty side. So we have no material impact on either line. I don\u2019t want to put this number in a bigger light than it should be. Hubert Joly : And as it relates to the TV business, the driver of this more favorable performance from the comp store sales standpoint is the size of the TVs. The mix is shifting to larger screen TVs. The units have always been up. It was the average selling price that was the issue. The shift towards larger screen is helpful. We are, of course, also intrigued by the innovation in the space with 4K TV, OLED TVs, and so forth. We love the fact that in our stores now there\u2019s TVs with a price point of $15,000, $8,000, and that\u2019s helpful from the top down selling standpoint. Operator : And our next question is from Kate McShane with Citi. Please go ahead. Kate McShane : Sharon, I wondered if you could give a little bit more detail about the increase in investment in price competitiveness. Is this mainly just for the holiday season? Or is this ongoing? And what form is this going to come in? Sharon McCollam : We believe that investment in price competitiveness is the way we have to operate our business. I think in Hubert\u2019s prepared remarks we call it table stakes. So the investments that we are making are where they\u2019re needed, and where we see that, versus the marketplace and competitors that we believe are relevant, our pricing is not in the market. We are making changes to that. There is the price matching, but that is not the big piece of this. We are proactively moving forward with price adjustments where we are not competitive. And we expect that to continue. Really, it started in the back half of Q4, and then advanced in Q1, came again in Q2, the investments in Q3 and Q4, on a year over year basis, and then we\u2019ll assess. I think we\u2019ve seen several analyst reports and various analyses that have been done on our pricing versus other retailers, and the general consensus seems to be, and we would agree, even from our own data, that we are getting closer to the competition every month that passes. Operator : And our next question is from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Horvers : You laid out the pressures in the coming four quarters or so from those three items. Can you talk about how much those items impacted the second quarter here as well as the first quarter? Sharon McCollam : The impact that we had in the second quarter obviously was substantially less than what we are anticipating for Q3 and Q4 on a year over year basis. Remember it\u2019s all about your compares. So on a year over year basis, it\u2019s substantial. On a sequential basis, it\u2019s important. So the pricing is one of the issues, but the second one that is even more substantial is this Geek Squad protection and the rapid exchange and the frequency that we\u2019re seeing on repair. And we\u2019ve sold a lot of phones, we\u2019ve sold a lot of Geek Squad protection plans, and when frequency goes up, it is an expensive business proposition. Obviously these legacy contracts that we sold, many of these contracts might be 24 months old, we are very very lenient in how we interact with the customer related to this. So it\u2019s something we have to work through. But the biggest impact that we\u2019re seeing from a sequential point of view is in the Geek Squad warranty protection. Chris Horvers : And then just related to that, given the reflowing of the stores, the Samsung and the Microsoft, do some of the cost savings flow through on a more robust basis in the back half versus perhaps the second quarter as well? Sharon McCollam : Hubert also, in his prepared remarks, called out that in Q2 we had an impact from the Samsung stores and Microsoft stores as well. But the impact of the Microsoft stores is substantially greater than what we did with Samsung. Because you\u2019re talking about the entire computer department. Also, the biggest piece of our own floor space optimization, where we\u2019re moving everything around in the store, is in Q3. And that is going to have a significant impact and disruption in the store. We expect that to be substantially bigger than it was in Q2. Hubert Joly : To elaborate a little bit, there is an impact on the top line. When a store is impacted by this optimization, the supply is impacted. And of course there is some cost associated with moving things around in the store. We expect of course for this year to be completed by the end of Q3, as we wouldn\u2019t want to be moving things around during the holiday season. Sharon McCollam : And I\u2019ll add one more thing to that. That cost is going to show up predominantly in SG&A. A lot of the work we\u2019re doing cannot be capitalized, and it will flow through in the SG&A line. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : First, on the Samsung stores, now that you have the majority rolled out, what is the sales impact that you\u2019ve been seeing from that initiative? And then second, what\u2019s the early competitive response that you\u2019ve seen from the pricing investments that you\u2019ve made? Hubert Joly : On the Samsung Experience shops, we are seeing, number one, very positive customer response. The same with Windows, but of course Samsung started earlier. The customers really appreciate the live displays, that you can actually touch and feel live product, which is not the case for other types of stores. They appreciate the combination of the expertise of the Samsung experts as well as the support and advice of the blue shirts. They appreciate the opportunity to navigate the store and look at these different ecosystems. Customer have choices. It\u2019s a wonderful experience to look at these various vendors. So a lot of positive feedback for Samsung, and the same is true for the Windows stores. There is of course a positive impact on the sales of the Samsung products, as you would expect. What we will be measuring is of course the impact on the overall store. But the way we\u2019ll measure it is in the overall comp store sales, because our goal as a company is of course to optimize and solve our two problems. And it\u2019s still very early in the game. The best way to measure it will be the overall performance of our comp store sales throughout the stores. So we are very excited about this. Your second question has to do with what\u2019s the competitive response to our pricing actions. This is a very competitive space, so I will not comment on the reactions of our competitors. To be clear, our goal is not to be lower than the competition. We believe that Best Buy offers a very compelling set of customer promises, with the assortment, the advice, the convenience, the service, and so our goal is simply to eliminate price as an obstacle to buy. We started with the price match. A year ago, everybody was talking about showrooming and so forth, so we love the traffic on our site, in our stores, and we don\u2019t want to lose a customer because of price. But we don\u2019t [see there\u2019s a need] to be lower than the competition, we just don\u2019t want to be beat. Operator : And our final question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Baker : I wanted to ask a little bit more about the TV business. You said it was flat. When was the last time it was flat? Do you think you\u2019re gaining share there? Or is that more a function of what\u2019s going on in the market? And you said one of the reasons for that was higher ASPs as the mix is getting to bigger TVs, but can you talk about the ASPs on a like-to-like TV this year versus last year? Has that started to stabilize at all? Hubert Joly : We believe that it\u2019s been three years since the comps in TVs were flat, which is why we highlighted this today. I want to also highlight the fact that while we have a positive impact on the top line from a comp standpoint, the U.S. consumer is still value-oriented. And so the choice the consumer is making is very much biased towards opening price points in these larger screen TVs. And so that means there continues to be margin pressure from that standpoint in the category. And frankly, I highlighted 4K and OLED and so forth, and why I think all of us can be excited by these shiny new objects. We don\u2019t expect that this is going to have a significant impact from the volume standpoint, but I would still encourage all of you on the call to consider visiting our stores, and we\u2019ll take care of you. Mike Baker : And do you think it\u2019s a function of share because of your aggressive in price, or is it the market doing better in TVs? Hubert Joly : We have been very competitive in TVs, so we\u2019re feeling good about our market share, our trends, again, our value proposition to the customer in that space. Operator : I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back to Bill Seymour for closing comments. Bill Seymour : That concludes our call. Thank you, operator.",

I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Bill. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin today with an overview of our third quarter results, as well as an update on our Renew Blue priorities. Then I will turn the call over to Sharon to provide further details. And finally, she and I will share a few thoughts about holiday. Our third quarter top line results make it clear that our focus on delivering our unique customer promises is starting to pay off. It is also clear that our efforts to control cost and to bring greater efficiency to our operations by improving our profitability. And while we remain mindful of the fact that we still have a long way to go, we are pleased with the progress of our Renew Blue transformation efforts. Specifically, during the quarter, we delivered a Domestic comparable store sale increase of 1.7%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of a better-than-expected $0.18. In addition, we continue to make substantial progress on our key Renew Blue priorities. This progress included, most notably, number one, driving the 15.1% increase in Domestic comparable online sales; number two, continuing to enhance our multi-channel customer experience with a nearly 400 basis point increase in our Net Promoter Score; three, completing this year's retail floor space optimization, including the deployment of vendor experiences; and four, eliminating an additional $115 million in annualized cost, bringing our total annualized cost reductions to $505 million toward our eventual target of $725 million. Let me now provide more details on our key Renew Blue priorities. So first, to accelerate online growth, we're continuing to focus on those initiatives that are designed to drive increased traffic and improve customer experience and higher conversion. In Q3, these initiatives included the continued optimization of site navigation through an improved taxonomy, which is driving improved natural search results and making it easier for customers to find the products they're looking for. Second, the narrowing of search results and browse pages with drop-down menus. Three is the implementation of a single-site sign-on capability, allowing loyalty program customers to see their My Best Buy points, reward certificates and other information directly on bestbuy.com instead of going to a separate website. Fourth, the enhancement of our buy online, pick up in-store experience by creating an easier process for customers to add service plans to their final purchase upon arrival in the store. And then five, a significant increase in the number of product reviews. In fact, we have already exceeded this year's goal of quadrupling the number of product reviews. As we enter the holiday season, the superior multi-channel customer experience is what we're focused on. As such, our fourth quarter online initiatives include, number one, the introduction of new product buying guides; two, the expansion of product information across categories; three, the addition of new marketplace partners to increase our online-only product assortments; and four, the leveraging of over 400 ship-from-store stores and 2 new online shipping locations within our existing DCs. Based on the early results from our ship-from-store pilots, we continue to believe that we will see the long-term benefits that we have previously shared, including improving our online conversion, more profitably selling returned and clearance inventory that is trapped in our stores, reducing markdown risk on product transitions and improving inventory management by increasing visibility to true multi-channel customer demands. Our second Renew Blue priority for this year is to escalate the multi-channel customer experience. Now we use NPS or Net Promoter Score to measure not only the satisfaction of customers that buy but also the customers who don't. In the third quarter, our Net Promoter Score improved by nearly 400 basis points year-over-year. And while we know there's still much to do to provide a consistently great experience to our customers, we're seeing improvements in all of our customer-facing functions, including stores, online, services and customer care. And we're particularly pleased to see the improvements, the strong improvements, being driven by the service provided by our Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents. In addition, during the third quarter, we took another step to improve the customer experience by reinventing our Reward Zone loyalty program and replacing it with an enhanced program that we've branded My Best Buy. This program has been designed to deepen our relationship with our customers by going beyond points and developing personalized shopping experiences, exclusive services and financial rewards that are not available from other retailers. The third Renew Blue priority is to increase revenue and gross profit per square foot to enhance floor space optimization and merchandising. During the third quarter, we continued our floor space optimization efforts, which included, number one, increasing space for growing and profitable categories like mobile phones, tablets and large and small appliances; number two, creating space to more effectively showcase fill-ins and open-box inventory; three, completing the rollout of 500 Windows Stores; four, redesigning space to support new gaming product launches; and five, adding expanded global displays in 750 large-format stores. These initiatives, of course, are in addition to running out the Samsung Experience Shops earlier this year. The customer feedback on all of our stores-within-a-store continues to be very positive. The fourth Renew Blue priority for this year is to drive down cost of goods sold through supply chain efficiencies and reverse logistics. In the third quarter, we completed the online expansion of our final 2 of 8 distribution centers to improve the time and cost of online delivery. We expanded the existing online fulfillment capabilities in one additional distribution center, and we continue to reduce cost through competitive bidding and rate negotiations. We also implemented new retail store replenishment processes, which will allow us to shorten our inventory replenishment windows during this year's holiday season. Reverse logistics was also a primary focus during the quarter. As we've discussed, customer returns, replacements and damages represent approximately 10% of our revenue and over $400 million a year in losses. In the third quarter, we took our first step to reduce these losses by creating space in our stores to more effectively showcase clearance and open-box inventory. In the first quarter, we plan to begin adding initial quantities of returns and open-box inventory to our online assortment. Today, only immaterial amounts of this inventory are available online, and adding it will be a gradual and incremental process due to system complexities and the time required to build our capability to assess the condition of the inventory prior to displaying it. By the end of next year, we expect to have made significant progress in creating greater consumer visibility to dispose of inventory. So through these and other supply chain services and loyalty program-related cost initiatives this quarter, we have eliminated $100 million in cost of goods sold, bringing our total annualized cost reductions to $165 million towards our eventual target of $325 million. Our fifth Renew Blue priority is to continue to gradually optimize our U.S. retail -- real estate portfolio. Occupancy cost reduction and retail capital allocation remain a key focus. As such, during the quarter, we continued to renegotiate our rent reductions on expiring leases and we closed 2 mobile and 4 Pacific Sales stand-alone stores. In our large-format U.S. stores, we did not close any stores this quarter, but we'll be closing 1 additional store at the end of the year. As you can see from our year-to-date results, our retail performance is improving and the financial economics of closing stores is becoming less compelling. Additionally, with the rollout of ship-from-store, we are now looking at our stores strategically in relation to our longer-term supply chain strategy as we strive to deliver inventory to our customers when and where they want to receive it. Within our large-format U.S. stores, we're continuing with our rollout of 5 Magnolia Design Centers and 12 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-the-stores this fiscal year. These concepts are providing a higher-end and higher-touch customer experience and are testing well in the pilot stores. Our sixth Renew Blue priority is to further reduce SG&A cost. As we laid out at our Investor Meeting last November, we believe there is an opportunity to remove $400 million in SG&A from our North American business, and we're making substantial progress. Since our last earnings release, we've eliminated an additional $50 million in annualized SG&A cost, and this brings our annualized cost reduction to a total of $340 million towards our eventual target of $400 million. Now beyond the U.S., we're also rolling out our Renew Blue priorities in our International business. While we are continuing to address ongoing top line challenges, we are pleased with the International cost reductions we have made to date. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to cover more details on our third quarter financial performance. Sharon L. McCollam: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Like Hubert, I'd like to reiterate how pleased we were with the strong operational execution that we saw in the third quarter. This is a capability that is fundamental to our transformation, and the progressively better outcomes that we are seeing each quarter are not only contributing to higher NPS scores but also to better-than-expected financial results. The highlights of these results in the third quarter were as follows. Enterprise revenue declined 0.2% to $9.4 billion, primarily due to prior quarter store closings and continued softness in International. Non-GAAP diluted EPS, however, increased $0.14 to $0.18 versus $0.04 last year. This increase was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost savings, a short-term benefit from the transition of the new credit card agreement and strong expense management, partially offset by higher year-over-year investments in price competitiveness. Domestic revenue increased 2.3% to $7.8 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 1.7%. And if you exclude the impact of short-term disruptions during the quarter due to the floor space optimization and Windows Stores rollout, comparable store sales growth would have been approximately 2%. From a merchandising perspective, growth in mobile phones, appliances and notebooks was partially offset by expected declines in gaming, movies and digital imaging. The online channel also delivered strong growth during the quarter as comparable sales increased over 15%. This increase was driven by the online initiatives that Hubert shared with you earlier, in addition to increased online marketing and a significantly higher number of online orders being placed in our retail stores. In addition, increased traffic, higher average order value and improved inventory availability contributed to these stronger-than-expected results. And if you include this quarter's online demand for new gaming console preorders, which were not shipped and will not be recognized as revenue until the fourth quarter, comparable online demand would have increased approximately 20%. In International, we had a challenging quarter as revenue declined 11.3% to $1.5 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by a comparable store sales decline of 6.4%, of which almost 1/3 was driven by mobile phone inventory constraints in Canada. Additionally, lost revenues from 35 previously closed stores, including 15 in Canada and 20 in China, and the negative impact of foreign currency impacted the comp. The balance of the comparable store sales decline was driven by lower industry demand for consumer electronics in Canada and the May 2013 expiration of government subsidies in China. Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise gross profit rate for the third quarter was 23.2% versus 23.8% last year, a decline of 60 basis points. The Domestic gross profit rate was 23.6% versus 24.2% last year, also a decline of 60 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by increased product warranty costs in the mobile phone category, a lower mix of mobile phone service plans and a greater investment in price competitiveness. These impacts were partially offset, however, by a short-term transition benefit from the new credit card agreement with Citibank. In future quarters, as we discussed in Q2, the new agreement with Citibank will negatively impact the company's gross profit rate, as the economics are significantly less favorable than the expired agreement long term. International gross profit rate was 21.2% versus 21.8% last year, again a decline of 60 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by increased promotional activity in Canada and an unfavorable product mix in Canada. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $2 billion or 21.8% of revenue versus 23.4% last year, a decline of over $150 million or 160 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 21.7% of revenue versus 23.5% of revenue last year, a decline of nearly $100 million or 180 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by the realization of our Renew Blue cost-reduction initiatives, tighter expense management throughout the company, lower store-labor-related expenses and executive transition costs last year that did not recur this year. These impacts were partially offset by Renew Blue investments in mobile advertising and the re-platforming of bestbuy.com. International non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $333 million or 22% of revenues versus 22.7% of revenue last year, a decline of over $50 million or 70 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost reductions and tighter expense management in Canada and, to a lesser extent, the elimination of expenses associated with previously closed stores. From a working capital perspective, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet during the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents increased $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by the sale of Best Buy Europe and proactive working capital management. Receivables increased $98 million or 9.6% to $1.1 billion primarily due to the agreed-upon timing of payments related to the LCD litigation settlement that we discussed in Q2. Merchandise inventories decreased $678 million or 8.9% to $7 billion primarily due to aggressive inventory management, including an ongoing reduction in our clearance and at-risk inventory. Accounts payable decreased $482 million or 6.8% to $6.6 billion primarily due to lower inventory and the timing of inventory purchases for the holiday season. And now as we look forward to the fourth quarter, I would like to turn the call back over to Hubert to talk about our holiday strategy. Hubert Joly : So thank you, Sharon. Looking ahead to the holiday season and beyond, our strategy is to continue to drive our Renew Blue transformation. Our mission is to be the destination and authority for technology products and services. We are here to help our customers discover, choose, purchase, finance, activate, enjoy and eventually replace their technology products and solutions. We also help our vendor partners market their products by providing them the best showroom for technology products, both online and in our stores. Now specifically for holiday, we have worked to enhance and deliver on our unique customer promises. First, we are offering highly competitive prices and compelling promotions, as we believe that price competitiveness is table stakes. Our price competitiveness is augmented by a number of things. One is up to 6% in rewards value with the use of My Best Buy credit card. Second, valuable trading promotions. Next is our Low Price Guarantee. And four is free shipping for online orders over $25. We're also delivering a curated assortment of exciting new products, including 2 new gaming platforms, new mobile phones, new tablets. In fact, on new tablets, Best Buy is the only national retailer where you can touch, try and buy the top 5 brands of tablets. So new tablets, and then a number of branded exclusives only at Best Buy products and services for the holiday season. Beyond assortment, we will be providing significantly enhanced manageable and impartial advice to our customers, including through the online channel with an improved taxonomy, a new search engine, new buying guides and expanded product informations, as I discussed earlier. In our stores, we've continued to invest in training and coaching and have begun the process of equipping our Blue Shirts with new tablet-based tools that allow them to access online resources to aid customers wherever they may be on the retail sales floor. And of course, through our strategic vendor partnerships, we are providing a renewed shopping experience with the presence of Apple, Samsung and Windows experts in our stores. In addition, we've enhanced the multi-channel convenience of shopping at Best Buy by offering our customers the ability to shop when and where they want, including shopping online with either in-home delivery or in-store pickup options, offering expanded Black Friday hours opening at 6 p.m. Thanksgiving evening and remaining open until 10 p.m. on Black Friday, increasing the number of Black Friday doorbuster deal events and hosting a number of exclusive-access events for My Best Buy members. In addition to offering customers the ability to shop when and where they want, we've also taken great steps to ensure maximum product availability for our customers through the leveraging of our ship-from-store capabilities and new online shipping locations. Finally, our fifth promise is our ability to offer support for the life of the product, including in-store product setup, holiday hotline, delivery installation, technical advice and services provided by Geek Squad. Altogether, I am excited about the focus and even the obsession our management team has on delighting our customers and on winning. This bodes well for the future steps in our journey to make Best Buy a company with which customers develop a deep and rich relationship. Now I will now turn the call over back to Sharon to cover our outlook for the fourth quarter. Sharon L. McCollam: Thank you. As Hubert said, we are encouraged by the progress we have made against our Renew Blue priorities and are optimistic about the strength of our holiday-specific merchandising, marketing and customer experience initiatives. We are also optimistic about the traffic generation and holiday electronics focus that the new big gaming launches will bring to our stores and our websites, albeit at low margins. But as we enter the fourth quarter, we're also highly aware of the public statements that are being made by our competitors as it relates to their promotional plans for Black Friday and the fourth quarter. We know that we will be facing an increasingly promotional environment. As such, we want to give you color on our response to this competitive situation, and our perspectives on how these pressures could financially impact the fourth quarter. First and foremost, we are committed to being competitive on price. As Hubert mentioned, it's table stakes in our transformation. So if our competition is, in fact, more promotional in the fourth quarter, we will be too, and that will have a negative impact on our gross margin. We are also committed to serving our customers when and where they want to be served. And in light of our competitors' decisions to open early for Black Friday, we too are opening our stores early. This requires increased promotional offers and an incremental investment in store payroll. But again, it's table stakes. In addition, you will recall from last quarter's earnings release that we had already identified other P&L drivers that we expected to negatively impact our fourth quarter operating income rate, which we quantified at a negative 40 to 70 basis point impact to last year's fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.7%. This 40 to 70 basis point impact reflects the negative impact of ongoing pricing investments, the negative impact of our $150 million to $200 million in fiscal '14 incremental Renew Blue SG&A investments, the temporary negative impact of our mobile warranty cost and the negative impact of the economics of our new credit card agreement, all substantially offset by the positive impact of the $505 million in annualized Renew Blue cost savings. But now as a result of the additional holiday pressures we just discussed, we believe it's prudent to narrow this range to 60 to 70 basis points for the fourth quarter, made up of an estimated 80 to 90 basis point negative impact on gross margins and an estimated positive 10 to 20 basis point impact on SG&A. But this 60 to 70 basis point impact only pertains to these specific fourth quarter P&L drivers and it's not intended to be interpreted as financial guidance on our overall perspective on the fourth quarter results. The reason we say this is that, over the last several quarters, above and beyond our Renew Blue cost savings, our core business performance has stabilized and our product mix and non-Renew Blue cost-containment initiatives have been stronger than expected. So assuming this level of performance continues, we do expect to be able to offset some or all of this impact. As it relates to these P&L drivers for fiscal '15, the projections we laid out in last quarter's earnings release have not changed and are reiterated as follows : negative 60 to 90 basis points in Q1 fiscal '15, negative 70 to 100 basis points in Q2 of fiscal '15 and a negative 30 to 60 basis points in Q3 of fiscal '15. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : I do want to get a little more into the Renew Blue strategy. We want to lob [ph] through how the costs are coming out. You can certainly see that in the leverage. Can you get more specific on how the top line improvement is coming around, particularly traffic sequentially, whether it's the store-within-a-store programs, the new TV merchandising. You mentioned mobile hurting from a margin perspective, but did that help from a top line perspective? Any detail on that would be great. Hubert Joly : Greg, thank you for your question. I think you're asking for the driver of the growth in our comps in the U.S. It's really a combination of things. One is there's category growth. We've highlighted that's mobile, tablet. Appliances, I think you've seen, very significant, I think it's 25% year-over-year growth in appliances. So there's a good a pull from these categories, which is of course further helped by the floor space optimization initiatives, as well as the deployment of the vendor experiences. So we are very pleased that this is producing results. The other drivers of the total comp are, of course, online, the 15% is helpful. And in the stores, we're seeing better execution, frankly. The customer's feedback is very positive as it relates to the Blue Shirts. So we've seen movements, positive movements, in the close rates. The total traffic is up. Increasingly, I think the traffic is going to be difficult to interpret from the standpoint that the shopping experience really changes. People are starting their shopping experience online, which highlights the importance of our online strategy, and the number of visits to the stores naturally go down. And but I don't think it's really matters at the end. Our overall focus is on the overall top line and comps. Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division : And if I could follow up on that, Hubert. The -- and so traffic, it's changing as the conversion rate goes up. If we measured it in terms of transactions, because maybe people are will be more likely to close but there's fewer people coming. Was that positive in the quarter, or was that still a challenge? Hubert Joly : I think that we are seeing there's multiple drivers here. One element where we're seeing some positive trends is the average order value, in particular online as well as in the stores. For example, we've highlighted the ability to get Geek Squad protection on at the time of in-store pickup. We think that's a very positive element. Again, another driver of traffic, Greg, is, as you know, we are reducing the focus on the high-velocity music physical media products, and that's impacting traffic. As we move to, let's say, appliances, I think you and I would agree that the frequency by which we replace an oven, washing machine and so forth is less than a music CD. So we're sending -- we're seeing structural changes in -- that can impact the traffic in the short term. And the reason why I'm highlighting that is that I don't think it's a big issue. What matters from an economic standpoint, again, is the dollar value of the top line. So how it's constructed is changing, and as we move forward, we'll continue to deepen our understanding of that, but I'm not obsessing about these traffic drivers because they are all of these changes. And again in total, when you include online, traffic is significantly up. So the attraction of Best Buy vis-a-vis the customers is moving forward in the right direction. So I hope that helps in the understanding. Sharon L. McCollam: And Greg, I might add one thing to all the information that Hubert provided as well. We are also on the online side. This quarter, we launched our new My Best Buy. And we are working, actually, very hard to use the website as a source of relationship building and information for our customers. And we are going to great ends to make that happen because we believe that customers coming to the site over and over gets them used to coming to our site. It brings it -- it makes it more of a destination. So Scott is working and the teams are working very hard to get that traffic to the site so that we can continue to interact with our customers. So you're going to see a big push here and continuing over the next several quarters as we make all these new changes to our website. We want to bring customers there. So of course, when you bring traffic that you're not intending per se to convert, you're going to affect that conversion rate in the online side. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : My question was regarding price competition. I'm just curious, as you have made price investments over the course of the first 3 quarters, if you're seeing anything in terms of competitive response and also the level at which customers are asking for a price match request against competitors. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Dan. So clearly, we've established our strategy for pricing. Our strategy is to be price competitive, and we are continuing to invest -- will continue to invest in Q4 and in the first few quarters of fiscal '15 as we continue to optimize all of this. The primary driver we're using is the actual price that we set. The Low Price Guarantee, which is our price matching policy, which includes online, is a nice tool for the Blue Shirts to close the sale. From a frequency and cost standpoint, it's a relatively minor driver, but it's an effective tool to give the comfort to the customers that they're getting the right price. Competitive responses, it's hard for me to speak on behalf of our competitors. I don't want to say this, but I think both Sharon and I have said it : We're in this to win and we're in this to play to win, as opposed to not lose. So you're seeing a Best Buy that is back, and we're in there fighting. And there are some statements that have been made in the last several days by a number of competitors, and we're continuously monitoring the situation. And we're going to -- like we did last year, we're going to drive the outcome. We will not be shy about investing in winning the holiday season. I think the question about the reaction from the competitors, I think it'd be fair to -- for you to ask them. I don't want to comment on them, but hopefully, I'm giving you a sense of the spirit that is here at Best Buy. Operator : And our next question is from the line of David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets. David S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Can I talk to TV? I don't know if you gave what TV is specifically. Did you, were you able to comp positive for the quarter in the television category? Hubert Joly : So David, thank you for your question. In TV, from a dollar standpoint, we were flat and which I think is a nice trend compared to the past. And TV remains a very important category for us. In terms of product innovation, I think the movement towards ultrahigh definition or 4K TV is going to be an interesting development for next year, less so probably for this year in terms of quantities and overall impact. But I think we love the fact that there is innovation, meaningful innovation for the customer. And then when prices are starting to go down for these new products, I think this has the potential to continue to drive life into this category. David S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : When you look at sort of when -- VIZIO came in, I think, after the holiday last year. So you're having that this year on versus not having it last year. How much can that -- has that helped you from a market share standpoint, from a comp standpoint, adding sort of that price point into your mix? Hubert Joly : I think that having the right assortment is a very important part of our strategy. Across the various categories, we have this amazing assortment. Video has been a very nice addition, from a competitive standpoint and from a value standpoint for customers. So I think that you're highlighting something that's meaningful. David S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : And just a last comment. So I guess one of the things that seemed to really step up this holiday season was the 1-hour guarantee from Walmart. To me, that's -- I haven't seen anything sort of that dramatic in a very long time sort of around the Black Friday weekend. And then they actually came out today also, and I'm just curious if this was included in your comments this morning, also about sort of trying to match Black Friday prices a week ahead of time. You've made obviously a very strong statement today about what the promotional environment is like. Do you think you're cautious enough, even as dramatic as it has been out there? Hubert Joly : So obviously, David, we're watching the developments on a day-by-day basis. And I cannot comment on what I don't know because there may be new things happening in the next several weeks. I want to highlight that our promotional plans for Black Friday and power week, promotionally speaking, is very strong. The number of doorbuster deals, the quantities that we have available are very meaningful. So I don't want to comment specifically about Walmart's announcements from this morning. This is part of the day-to-day business. But this morning, certainly, Sharon and I wanted to give you, again, a flavor of our mindset. And we think it -- we need to be in the game. So that's what we're going to do. I would highlight that the plans we've prepared even before the Walmart announcement were very significant. Again, they were designed to win. So I think that's as much as we can say at this point. David S. Strasser - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : I figured as much. I just was figuring I just would ask because I was -- I've just been watching this and somewhat awe what they're saying. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : My question, I wanted to focus on sales. And you put up the Domestic comp of 1.7%, or 2% if you didn't have some of the disruption. Maybe a difficult question to answer, but if you look at that, the sales growth we saw here in the third quarter versus other quarters, how much do you think that improvement reflected internal initiatives as opposed to just a strength in the underlying environment for the consumer electronics space? Hubert Joly : So your question is, how much of the 2% or 1.7% is driven by what we've done versus the environment. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : Yes. Is there a way to parse that out? Hubert Joly : Yes, I'm not sure I have a finite breakdown of this. I can share the spirit in which we're fighting this war. If you remember, a year or 2 ago, the message from this company was all about the headwinds and to explain the results. We never talk about the headwinds. We've said, starting in November of last year, that's this was the overall environment was a positive one. There's a lot of product innovation. In fact, for this holiday season, there's probably more product innovation that we've seen in a long time. And we're focused on the levers that we can control. Our market -- our overall market share, even though we are by far the leader in the space, is only in the mid teens. So we don't think it's illegal, immoral, unethical to grow market share. And so that's the focus. We are pleased with the environment. We know that there is uncertainty how the consumer feels with everything that's going on in the country and in the world, but we don't really focus that much on every -- our emphasis is on what we can control because, again, we're only 15% of the market. So what we do has more impact, we think, than the overall environment. That's our -- that's the mindset. I wish I could give you the detailed answer. It's hard because there's so many moving pieces. But that's the mindset. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division : No, that's helpful. If I could just follow up, and I know it's very early in this next video gaming product cycle. We did have PlayStation 4 launch last week, and then Xbox -- the Xbox One will be launching shortly. Can you just describe? Again, I know it's early, but can you describe maybe the behavior of the customers coming in to buy those machines? Are you seeing additional purchases as they buy the machines? Or is it a one-off type event? Hubert Joly : Well, this is a very exciting development. And of course, with my video games background from 10 or 15 years ago, I'm personally excited about it. I was, of course, in the stores Thursday night for the PS4 launch, and I'll do the same with the Xbox One launch. There is so much excitement on the part of these gamers. And so we think it's a very positive development, from a consumer standpoint. Gaming is still very much alive. The quantities, Sony has reported, right, to 1 million units shipped and which is much faster than the PS3. So that's very encouraging. We -- Best Buy tends to do well in hardware even though, as Sharon has highlighted, the margins are not as exciting as the volumes, but that is very good. And we'll get more inventory next week. We'll try -- we have the plan to keep some of that inventory for our best customers. We want to -- we'll have some of that going on. So very exciting developments from a top line perspective. And more broadly speaking, again, if you look across all of the categories, this is a holiday season where there is, really, life from an innovation standpoint. So all of the discussions about product cycles and so forth that I was hearing last year, I think that's there's a lot of great stuff developed by our vendor partners. And I think consumer electronics toys, if I can put it this way, are going to be exciting for shoppers this holiday season. And because of our strengths in that space and the improved customer experience, we think we're a very attractive place where to shop. Operator : And our next question is from the line of David Schick with Stifel. David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : In walking your stores of late, there's a lot of things going on. There was a Google representative talking about the Nexus products, Chromebooks, with a Google shirt. I believe, third party, however, but there to talk and explain things. And I -- and at least in the market where we were, this was a someone with a finite period of time that we're going to be doing this for the holidays. So how should we think about other stores-within-the-store -- and there was a buildout there, other stores-within-the-stores, other vendors coming to you to forge these partnerships, as we go into next year? Hubert Joly : So thank you, David. Clearly, these vendor partnerships have been a major development for us this year. We had had Apple stores for a while in our stores, and we've added Samsung and Windows in a very meaningful way this year. Thank you for highlighting Google. For those of you, I hope there's very few, who've not seen our stores recently, there's 2, there's a meaningful table and a meaningful end cap. I think it's in 750 of our stores, with some staffing on the part of Google. Google's hardware business is obviously expanding and there is a lot of interesting product innovation. The Chromebook, Chromecast, Nexus tablet is very interesting. The customer feedback from all of these vendor experiences, as I said, is very positive. And strategically, I think what we've all seen is how meaningful Best Buy is as a platform for these vendor partners because we're the only place of scale where they can showcase the fruit of their billions of dollars of technology investment. And the ability of the customers to touch and feel these products across these ecosystems, if I can use this word, is very meaningful. So a lot of positive development. Excitement on the part of the vendors, look -- I think your question is, looking ahead, what's coming. The -- we don't have the vision of transforming the entire store in a collection of boutiques from these vendors. We have -- we use 3 criteria to decide whether we do additional stores-in-the-stores. Is it good for the customer? And by that, I mean, does it make sense to shop a vendor experience, as opposed to shop a category? Is it good for the vendor? And is it good for Best Buy? You can -- you probably have in mind a number of names that could make sense. If you have them in mind, probably assume that, there's discussions with all of them, but that doesn't mean they're going to bear fruit, right, because it needs to make sense, again, for the customer, the vendor and ourselves. But I think the basic idea is there, which is that, strategically, it's been very helpful from a customer standpoint, a vendor standpoint and, of course, for Best Buy. But more to come on that. David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : And just a quick follow-up with a cash balance. Any comment on the potential for share repurchase? Sharon L. McCollam: I'd just reiterate what we said. We're going to get through at holiday season. We believe that going into this season with the strength of the balance sheet that we currently have is a huge competitive advantage for us and certainly something that we feel our vendors deserve. So when we get past this year, we'll start talking about what our plans are going into next year. But at this point, our perspective on continuing to keep a much stronger cash balance on the balance sheet versus the past continues intact. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Scot Ciccarelli. I actually had a follow-up regarding the vendor stores. Can you guys provide any details or color kind of around the economics, how we -- how should we think about the vendor stores in terms of how they're performing or expected to perform? And then just a housekeeping item : What was the impact of the credit card on the gross margin in the quarter, Sharon? Hubert Joly : So let me start with the vendor stores, and then Sharon will take credit card. Scot, so each vendor store, of course, is going to be different. But generally speaking, Best Buy is not -- Best Buy's main activity is not philanthropy, so we are doing this because it makes sense from a financial standpoint. Generally speaking, there is more help provided from the vendor, as related to the cost of operating the stores-within-the-stores in terms of the either it could be the labor, the fixtures, the space, all of these things. There is a financial contribution, retail contributions. There is improved margins. It can be improved margins on the products. And then of course, importantly as well as sometimes or typically marketing support because these vendors can see their stores within Best Buy as their store, which it is, and therefore, directing traffic to Best Buy makes sense. I think you've seen some examples of that during the year. And of course, for us, as we think about the optimization of our economics in the floor space, we move the allocation of the floor space to growing profitable categories. And so mechanically, when you replace, let's say, physical music or reduce physical music and you have more phones and tablets, as examples, mechanically from a mix standpoint, you also have helped. So these are some of the drivers as we see that. The final one that I would add is that because we do this with the top vendors, of course, traffic, this is attractive for the customers, and that's the feedback we're getting. And again, what's unique about Best Buy and that makes it unique both for the customers and the vendor is the ability to touch and experience all of these ecosystems, right? So in the same store, you're going to be able to touch and feel an Apple product, a Samsung product, a Windows product. So that's also very meaningful, and it's helpful to our journey. Sharon L. McCollam: Again, on the question regarding the quantification of the credit card, we haven't quantified it. Obviously, we have an agreement with Citibank and we can't be disclosing the terms. But I would say that, just by the fact that we've called it out, it is an offset and it's an important number. So we have never quantified anything less than 10 or 20 basis points. So you can take it from there and work with that. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just could you talk -- Hubert and Sharon, kind of you've talked a lot about what's working. Could you talk about some areas possibly where you feel that you've been a little slower, things are running a little bit behind, and what you're doing to deal with that, if you go all the way back to Renew Blue? Hubert Joly : So your question is on what's not working. The way I would answer this is that, if you look at our glass, we can look at the half-full glass or part of the glass. Believe me, there is another part that's half-empty. And when I say half, that's because that's how the phrase comes in English, I think. And so then that leads me to the opportunities that we still have lying ahead. I think there's more efficiencies to be driven out. We're not stopping where we are, by any stretch of the imagination. And then I think, increasingly, we turn on the -- focus on the growth. I think our economics and economic engine really become interesting if we combine the power of efficiency with the power of more top line through our fixed cost base. And to get the growth, there's a number of governing thoughts here. It's all about the customer experience. Our key strategy in the context of price competitiveness is to drive the customer experience. You've heard us talk about the customer promises. Continuing to enhance and improve our delivery of our customer promises is going to be essential to our journey around the assortment and the selection, the advice, convenience, the service, the personalization. I think that, in terms of the growth engines, looking at the category strategies, how do we grow in a meaningful way in the key categories in which we are operating, and maybe some that are more longer-term growth potential, as this is a very dynamic space. I think that, from a channel perspective, online, are we happy where we are with online? We're happy with the progress, back to your point, but candidly, there's a lot of obsession on how to further drive this, drive the customer experience on the site in a very meaningful way. I think, how we address certain customer segments, think about millennials, think about buying occasions. As an example, we don't have a registry as a retailer. There's -- we're probably the only one who does not, and so on and so forth. So I think that we are very pleased and proud of our -- the progress we've made, but there's so much more to come. Again, from a cost standpoint. I could have highlighted returns, replacements and damages. This is -- we've talked about it. We've begun -- we've barely begun to take steps to address it. It's all in our future, the opportunity's all in our future for cost and revenue. So everything I said here is completely consistent with what we've been saying since November of last year, exactly a year ago, and we have to continue to drive this. So hopefully, this answers your question. Gary Balter - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes. Just a follow-up, and then I'll get off. The -- I was going to follow up on the customer return and damages area that you've highlighted in the past because, visiting some of your stores, we've seen in the corner, where I think you've had music in some stores, there's clearance, et cetera, I think it was called Etcetera [ph], is that something -- or is that part of the solution to the customer returns and damages? Are you planning to roll that out? Sharon L. McCollam: We -- and actually, in all of our stores, we have created a more significant presence to show room the -- showcase the returned inventory. But the longer-term opportunity for us is, today, the majority of our online inventory is not visible in the online channel. So the returns, replacements and damages, open box, et cetera is not visible. And as a result of that, there are steps that have to be taken and systems changes that have to be made in order to make that possible because, today, if you take one SKU, for instance, let's take you've got one SKU and it's a computer, it's some sort of computer : each one that gets returned that's open box may have a different dynamic. One of them may not have the original cord, so we've had to replace a cord because the customer returned it in a different way. One might have a very small imperfection somewhere on the case, and you have to be able to describe that. Now we do that today. We have a site that you may or may not be highly familiar with called CowBoom. And as we go forward, the capability -- that's a small site. It was never really intended to handle the kind of volume that Best Buy creates from a returns point of view, but that type of capability is what we are building and looking for. And that -- when we can open up the open-box and return inventory to that channel, we believe that that's when we really reach scale. And that's why, in the prepared remarks that Hubert put out today, we went into further discussion on that because it's something we're very encouraged by. Operator : And our final question comes from Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets. Anthony C. Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division : I just had a question on the appliance business. You had such a strong comp there. And comps have sequentially accelerated now for several quarters in a row. And I was just wondering if you can give us a little color on what's driving that. I mean, is it the housing market? Is it adding small appliances? Is it better execution, or some sort of combination of all three? Just wondering to see if you can give a little color there. Hubert Joly : Sure. Anthony, thank you for your questions. So the key drivers of our strong performance in Q3, of course, the housing market is -- I pull that back to my comment on focusing on our drivers. There's 4 main drivers of our performance in appliances in Q3. We've had -- we believe with -- promotions have been quite effective. We've added also appliance sales specialists in a number of our stores. This is a specialized area, so having more specialists is helpful. We've also expanded the small appliances category, which is a very exciting category where our market share is below 2%. So we can probably all agree that this is a growth opportunity. And then there is a positive impact of the Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store rollout and ramp-up. So these are the 4 drivers of performance with appliances, Anthony. Operator : And I'll now turn the call back to management for closing comments. Hubert Joly : Well, thank you so much. And as we end the call, of course, I'd like to take a moment to thank our leadership team, our associates and our vendor partners and, of course, their families for what they've done and what they will be doing to serve our customers and win during the holiday season. I also want to thank our shareholders for their ongoing support. And I want to wish all of them and all of you a very happy and joyful holiday season, which will not be complete without a trip or several trips to bestbuy.com or our stores. So I'll see you there. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

McCollam - CFO Analysts: Michael Lasser - UBS David Magee - SunTrust Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Gary Balter - Credit Suisse David Schick - Stifel David Strasser - Janney Capital Markets Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy's fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Bill Seymour, vice president of investor relations. Bill Seymour : Good morning, and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our president and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. As usual, the media will be participating in this call on a listen-only mode. This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings release that we issued earlier today. They both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release. Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments, and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements.  Please refer to the company's current earnings release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. All information regarding the company\u2019s results pertain to continuing operations, and do not include the impact of the European business, which was sold on June 26, 2013, or mindSHIFT Technologies, which was sold on February 1, 2014. In today\u2019s earnings release and conference call, as we did in our holiday release, we refer to consumer electronics, or CE, industry trends and our market share. Share gain is determined by reference to the information from the NPD Group. The CE industry, as defined by the NPD Group, includes TV, desktop, notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging, and other categories. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances, or services. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly :  Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In today\u2019s call, we\u2019re going to start with a recap of our fourth quarter results and an overview of the progress we have made against our fiscal 2014 renewable priorities. Then we\u2019ll provide an update on our Renew Blue strategy and our outlook for fiscal 2015. So as we discussed in our holiday sales call, the fourth quarter was an environment of declining retail traffic, intense promotion, fewer holiday shopping days, and severe weather. It was also an environment of weaker than expected industry sales in the consumer electronics category, in an environment of evolving consumer behavior, as the customer\u2019s affinity for online shopping continued to escalate. So what did we do? We focused on the things we can control, without losing sight of what was really important, our customers, and the promises that we make to them. As such, we continued to invest in our price competitiveness, albeit at a cost, and identified our focus on improving our [personal] efficiencies, driving down our costs and lowering our inventories.  The net financial result of these efforts was a comparable store sales decline of 1.2% and an operating margin decline of 120 basis points. While of course we cannot be satisfied with a fourth quarter operating margin decline of 120 basis points, the decline included an expected approximately 100 basis point negative impact associated with our mobile warranty and new credit card agreement economics that we called out in our Q3 call. Thus, we were able to materially offset the price investments we have been making with substantial cost savings and other operational improvements. Within these results, though, were mixed outcomes I would like to highlight. First, we gained market share, but as I said, it came at a cost. When we entered the quarter, we knew that pricing would be [unintelligible], and we tried to invest 40 basis points in structural and promotional pricing. To defend our market share and stimulate traffic, we increased our price investment by an estimated 85 basis points to 125 basis points. Make no mistake, though, while we know we have an opportunity to improve the effectiveness of our marketing and promotional activities, this price investment was strategically important. Why? Because it is imperative in our transformation that we retain and attract new customers to our brand. And to do so, we had to live up to our customer promise to be price competitive, and we were. And the customer noticed. In the environment we were operating in, where industry sales and our own store traffic were down, our price investment and improved customer experience allowed us to mitigate our adjusted domestic comparable store sales decline to 0.6%, and improve our [unintelligible] Net Promoter Score by 300 basis points. It also allowed us to aggressively drive our online business, which grew more than 25% in the quarter compared to 11% last year.  Additionally during the quarter, the shift to the online channel crystalized for us what we had believed all year, that the pace at which consumers would migrate to the online channel would accelerate in the fourth quarter, and we were prepared. Operationally, virtually every metric that we use to measure the [unintelligible] in the online channel was up in the fourth quarter and our domestic online sales reached 12.7% of total domestic sales, which was 10% last year. But this, too, came at a price, as profitability in the online channel today is lower than retail. Why? Because today, the online channel has a higher mix of lower margin hardware sales and [attach] rates on services and accessories are lower. So while we\u2019re working on our online capabilities to increase attach rates and drive a more profitable sales mix, we expect the improvement to come gradually and incrementally over time. Now, to close on fiscal 2014 as a whole, I would like to take a moment and take stock of the progress we have made on our Renew Blue priorities. First, after only one year, we have exceeded our Renew Blue cost reduction target of $725 million, delivering Renew Blue cost reductions totaling $765 million. Second, we have made progress in standardizing our top and bottom lines.  Domestic comparable store sales for the year were virtually flat, domestic operating margin, however, was down 70 basis points. That\u2019s compared to 130 basis points in the previous year. Again, excluding the impact of the increased mobile warranty expense, our cost savings and other operational improvements have materially offset our pricing and other Renew Blue investments.    Third, and very important to our future, we\u2019ve enhanced how we serve our customers, and we\u2019ve been building key foundational capabilities. Most notably, we have increased domestic online sales for the year by 20%, which significantly increased our price competitiveness, and have rolled out ship from store to more than 1,400 locations. We have opened 1,400 Samsung and 600 Windows stores within a store, and completed the first phase of our floor space optimization. We have increased our Net Promoter Score by more than 300 basis points, and we\u2019ve relaunched our loyalty and credit card program. We\u2019ve advanced the transformation of our ecommerce platform and customer database, and we have significantly strengthened our balance sheet to a renewed focus on our core business and a substantially more disciplined capital allocation process.  So before I talk about the next phase of Renew Blue, I will now turn the call over to Sharon for additional color on our fourth quarter financial results. Sharon McCollam : Thank you, and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I\u2019d like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales press release. In the holiday sales press release, we said that we expected our fourth quarter operating margins to decline 175 to 180 basis points due to the intense pricing pressure in the holiday season. What we reported this morning was an operating margin decline of 120 basis points. This 55 to 60 basis point favorability, all in the month of January of course, was primarily driven by an overall less promotional retail environment, stronger than expected participation from our vendors in the support of our price investments, and tighter expense management. I\u2019ll now talk about the fourth quarter versus last year. Enterprise revenue declined 3% to $14.5 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS declined to $1.24 versus $1.47 last year. This decline was primarily driven by a significant investment in price competitiveness, the negative impact associated with our mobile warranty and new credit card economics, and a lower gross margin in mobile due to the lower attachment rates on mobile service plans. These declines, however were substantially offset by a $0.15 per diluted share favorable income tax resolution in fiscal \u201914 that did not occur in fiscal \u201913, the favorable impact of our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives, tighter expense management throughout the company, and lower incentive compensation. Domestic revenue of $12.3 billion declined 1.8% versus last year. This decline was primarily driven by a comparable store sales decline of 1.2%, but excluding a 30 basis point impact from the rationalization of noncore businesses and an additional 30 basis point impact from the services related profit sharing payment that occurred in January \u201913 but did not occur in January fiscal \u201914, domestic comparable store sales would have declined approximately 0.6%. From a merchandising perspective, growth in computing, appliances, and gaming was more than offset by declines in other categories including digital imaging, movies, and home theater. The domestic online channels delivered strong growth during the quarter as comparable store sales increased 25.8% to $1.6 billion. This increase was driven by a higher average order value, improved inventory availability supported by ship from store and the expansion of our online distribution network, increased traffic, and higher conversion on both our core and mobile sites. As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online sales increased 270 basis points to 12.7% from 10% last year.  As we expect this online mix shift to continue, it is important to recall from Hubert\u2019s earlier comments that the profitability of the online channel today is lower than our retail stores. Over time, though, through a series of initiatives to improve online attach rates and strategic pricing, we do expect online profitability to gradually and incrementally improve. But in the short term, it will remain under pressure due to the investments necessary to achieve these outcomes as well as to significantly improve the customer experience. In international, revenue declined 9.6% to $2.2 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, the loss of revenue from large format store closures in Canada and China, and a comparable store sales decline of 1.7% driven by declining industry trends in Canada and Mexico. Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise gross profit rate for the fourth quarter was 20.2% versus 22.3% last year, a decline of 210 basis points. The domestic gross profit rate declined 230 basis points to 20% versus 22.3% last year. Excluding the 30 basis point impact from the periodic profit sharing payment that we just discussed, the domestic gross profit rate declined 200 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by the 125 basis point incremental year over year investment in structural and promotional pricing, a 40 basis point negative impact associated with the new credit card agreement, a 35 basis point negative impact from the increased mobile warranty costs, and a lower gross margin in mobile, [unintelligible] lower attachment rates on mobile service plans. The attach was substantially offset, however, by the realization of [unintelligible] cost reduction and other supply chain cost containment initiatives. The international gross profit rate was 21.3% versus 22.3% last year. This 100 basis point decline was primarily driven by increased promotional activity and a mix shift into lower margin products in Canada. Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.3 billion, or 15.7% of revenue, versus 16.6% last year, a decline of over $200 million or 90 basis points. Non-GAAP domestic SG&A expenses declined approximately $150 million, or 90 basis points, to $1.9 billion, or 15.5% of revenue versus 16.4% of revenue last year. This 90 basis point rate decline was primarily driven by the realization of Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives, tighter expense management throughout the company, lower legal related expenses, and lower incentive compensation. These impacts was partially offset by Renew Blue investments in online growth and advertising. International non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $363 million, or 16.7% of revenue, versus 17.7% of revenue last year, a decline of over $62 million or 100 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost reductions and tighter expense management in Canada. Also during the fourth quarter, the company recorded pretax restructuring charges totaling $115 million, primarily related to severance charges associated with the optimization of the field and store operating models in the U.S. and Canada. The majority of this $150 million is expected to be paid in cash this year. The company also recorded $65 million of nonrestructuring asset impairment. These noncash impairments were primarily related to our U.S. stores, both big box and mobile. In light of these impairments and our continued focus on the evolving retail environment, we will continue to focus on optimizing the real estate portfolio over time. These restructuring and impairment charges are excluded from our non-GAAP results. I will now turn the call back over to Hubert to talk about our plans for 2015 and beyond. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Sharon. I would now like to discuss our plans going forward. Our strategy is clear. It is to be the authority and destination for technology products and services. And as our transformation is a multiyear journey, and we are operating in an ever changing retail environment, we thought it was important today to share with you our Renew Blue roadmap over the next 24 months. During this time, we will continue to address three business imperatives. Number one, improving our operational performance, number two building foundational capabilities necessary to unlock future growth strategies, and number three, leveraging our unique assets to create significant differentiation that is meaningful for our customers and our vendors. Our roadmap for achieving these business imperatives is built around the following areas : merchandising, marketing, online, stores, supply chain, Geek Squad services, cost structure, and employee engagement. Let me cover each of these. Our first area is merchandising. Our goal is to create a compelling assortment online and in the stores, with a superior end to end customer experience that yields enhanced [unintelligible] returns.  Our priorities in merchandising over the next 24 months are to develop compelling and differentiated strategies for key categories that make promoters out of customers and that leverage Best Buy\u2019s competitive assets; to strengthen our vendor partnerships, including launching new vendor shopping experiences; to implement an enhanced online shopping experience for key categories and to continue to optimize space and shoppability in our stores as well as improving visual merchandising; expand our private label and branded exclusive product assortment; expand [unintelligible] in home and Magnolia design centers stores within a store, which are proving to provide a superior customer experience; and then of course optimizing returns, replacements, and damages through operational improvements [unintelligible] from store. And of course, we will continue to refine our pricing and promotional strategy.  So that\u2019s for merchandising. Next is marketing. Our goal here is to unlock growth opportunities by creating and effectively communicating new compelling value propositions for customers that go beyond price.  Our priorities in marketing over the next 24 months include developing more targeted, more relevant, more personalized, digital customer communications for key touchpoints of the customer experience and shopping journey in support of our category strategy.  The next is to implement programs for key buying occasions like gifting, life events and registry, and new movers. And it is to create greater engagement with customers through our loyalty program and our credit card offerings. Let me highlight here the opportunity we have related to developing a more relevant and personalized marketing approach. As you know, Best Buy has one of the biggest house files in retail. We have been working on a big data project called Athena that will enable a more targeted approach to customer marketing, based for example on past purchases, browse history, location, and demographics. With Athena in place, over time we will be able to shift more of our marketing effort to targeted email messages and offers.  The next area is online. Our goal here is to continue to capture online share and serve the customers based on how, where, and when they want to be served. Our online priorities over the next 24 months are to further improve the online shopping experience by enhancing search, tools, recommendations, and product and price information to make it easier for customers to find and choose products.  It is to encourage customers to complete their technology solutions by improving the presentation and messaging of accessories and services that enable customers to build their own bundle. It is to leverage our expanded supply chain capabilities to provide superior fulfillment solutions. It is to continue to reengineer our ecommerce technology platform so that new features and functions can develop quickly and optimize across platforms. The fourth area is our retail stores. Our ability to transform Best Buy is of course highly dependent on our ability to transform our in-store experience. To that end, we are evolving our sales organization based on what we see as the mission of retail, which is, number one, the maniacal execution of category and functional strategies, number two, the development and implementation of effective market level strategies that take into account local specificities, and number three, the ability to lift our performance in terms of employee engagement, customer satisfaction, sales, and profitability. To do this, we\u2019re making significant changes to the field and store structure. We are organizing retail around the stores and making the stores fully accountable for their performance under the leadership of the store general managers. We\u2019re designing the structure above stores to support the general managers and their teams by providing both strategies that are readily executable and the tools and support necessary to execute them, and we are organizing around key markets with the goal of having a winning strategy for each of these markets. And finally, we are ensuring that any investment we make is customer facing and adds value while minimizing indirect spend. What we expect from these changes is a high level of performance. In addition, our customers will see concrete changes in the stores stemming from our collaboration with key vendors, which we started last year, and the improvements in visual merchandising we mentioned earlier, as well as better tools made available to our sales consultants and customers. The fifth area is supply chain. Our supply chain is a competitive advantage. It is driven by a powerful network of strategically located distribution centers and now with ship from store, our national retail footprint with shipping capabilities.  Our goal over the next 24 months is to leverage this network and improve our customer experience by providing, number one, increased inventory availability, number two, improved speed to customer, and number three, improved home delivery and installation capabilities for our large [cube] assortments. To achieve this, we will continue to invest in systems and infrastructure to drive significantly enhanced delivery options.  One example that has proven to be transformational is ship from store. In the fourth quarter, even in its early stages and with limited deployment, ship from store enabled significant online growth, improved online conversion, and increased store comps.  Now that we have ship from store across our full store chain, in the first half of this year we will be able to use our over 1,400 stores and eight well located distribution centers to improve speed to customer, enabling faster delivery of online purchases at lower cost to Best Buy. In fact, we\u2019ve recently reduced the delivery window promise to customers by two full days, and we will also begin adding returns and open box items that are sitting in our stores to our online inventory.  Along with the clear customer experience benefit, this capability will accelerate our online growth and provide us a major opportunity to further reduce the over $400 million we lose each year from returned products. Our next priority focuses on Geek Squad services. The Geek Squad is one of Best Buy\u2019s biggest competitive advantages, and yet, at the same time, it is an underutilized asset. Our goal for the Geek Squad is to deliver an amazing and lasting customer experience while providing a key revenue and profit growth engine for the company. Our goals for Geek Squad over the next 24 months are the following. Number one, to continue to reduce our legacy cost structure to help fund our price competitiveness. Number two, to improve our service delivery and the service experience we provide to our customers. Number three, it is to refine existing service offerings like our extended warranty services. Number four is to improve the merchandising of our services. And number five is to build new offerings that meet the needs of customers in the context of today\u2019s technology environment. The next area is our cost structure. Our goal here is to more quickly and deeply reduce our costs. We announced this morning that we have eliminated a total of $765 million in annualized costs out of the original $725 million North American opportunity.  We are now increasing our target from $725 million to $1 billion, and these additional cost reductions will be coming primarily from returns replacements and damages, logistics and supply chain, and procurement. And of course we will continue to rationalize our organization, and as we have done in the past, we will report on these savings when they have been executed.  One key opportunity worth highlighting is returns, replacements, and damages, which are approximately 10% of revenue and are costing the company over $400 million a year in P&L losses. We feel confident that we can meaningfully reduce these losses. Actions we are taking include making this inventory more visible and easily purchased by customers by leveraging store clearance areas, [unintelligible], and ship from store. Also, improving the shopping experience for buying online clearance items through better site design, assortment, and clearance pricing, by expanding clearance pricing to more core categories and to open box products. Finally, let me talk about a key foundational area of focus for us, which is employee engagement. Across the company, we must have a passionate commitment to serving our customers in such an extraordinary manner that they become promoters of Best Buy. Key to achieving this goal is the talent and engagement of our people. In line with this, we\u2019ll be pursuing the following key initiatives over the next 24 months. Number one, successfully implementing our new field and store operating model. Number two, strengthening our talent in the critical areas of ecommerce and targeted, personalized marketing. Number three, enhancing our performance management process by streamlining the number of metrics and aligning team objectives across the company. And number four, redefining key business processes to better support our multichannel customer focused strategy. Now let me say one word about international before I conclude. In our international business, we will continue to focus on improving our performance. Largely as a part of our renewable initiatives, we reduced international SG&A by 12% in fiscal 2014. In the first quarter of this year, we have taken significant further actions to reduce Canada\u2019s cost structure. So in summary, while our transformation is off to an encouraging start, it is still in its early stages. During fiscal 2014, we began the strong foundational work that will allow us to begin improving our performance and quite frankly we continue to be very excited by our concrete operational improvement opportunities. And of course, all of these initiatives we discussed today are in the pursuit of our long term non-GAAP target of 5% to 6% operating margin and 13% to 15% return on invested capital. Let me now turn the call back over to Sharon for more comments about our financial outlook. Sharon McCollam :  Thank you, Hubert. In fiscal \u201915, as Hubert shared with you, we are focused on three imperatives to drive our Renew Blue transformation : improving our operational performance including more quickly and more deeply reducing our costs, building foundational capabilities necessary to unlock future growth strategies which will require incremental investment, and leveraging our unique assets like our customer database to create significant differentiation that is meaningful for our customers and our vendors. With each of these imperatives that Hubert outlined comes year over year financial change, both positive and negative, and we know that modeling such changes absent additional information in a transformation like ours is extremely difficult.  Therefore, as we have done in the past several quarters, we are providing you today with our quarterly estimates of how these discrete financial impacts will affect our quarterly operating income rates for 2015.  These financial impacts continue to include the following business drivers : the negative impact of ongoing pricing investments, the negative impact of our incremental Renew Blue SG&A investments, the temporary negative impact of our mobile warranty costs, the negative impact of the economics of our new credit card agreement, and the offsetting positive impact of the realization of Renew Blue cost savings, which now total $765 million on an annualized basis. In our Q3 fiscal \u201914 earnings release, we quantify the net year over year impact of these drivers to the operating income rate by quarter, as follows : negative 60 to 90 basis points in Q1 fiscal \u201915, negative 70 to 100 basis points in Q2 fiscal \u201915, and negative 30 to 60 basis points in Q3 fiscal \u201915. Today, due to a higher than expected negative impact from the economics of the new credit card agreement, and the incremental year over year pricing investments, we are now expecting the net impact of these drivers to be a negative 70 to 90 basis points in Q1 fiscal \u201915. But for Q2 and Q3 fiscal \u201915, we have good news, because due to the timing of the benefits associated with the greater Renew Blue cost savings that we discussed this morning, we will be able to significantly offset the impact of the negative P&L drivers that we provided in Q3 for those quarters. We will also have discrete year over year impact related to income tax in fiscal \u201915. In Q1 fiscal \u201915, we expect to reorganize certain foreign legal entities to simplify our overall structure. This reorganization will accelerate a noncash tax benefit of approximately $0.87 to $1.01 per diluted share. Due to its materiality, this benefit will be treated as a non-GAAP adjustment. In prior years, this benefit has been historically recognized, though, on a periodic basis. So as a result of this acceleration, the company will have a higher quarterly income tax expense and income tax rate going forward on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. For tax purposes, this benefit will continue to be amortized. In addition, there are other discrete year over year income tax related items that we also expect will have a negative impact on the fiscal \u201915 income tax expense and the fiscal \u201915 income tax rate. We estimate the combined diluted EPS impact of these discrete income tax related items on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis to be as follows : negative $0.03 to $0.04 in Q1 fiscal \u201915, flat to positive $0.01 in Q2 fiscal \u201915, flat to negative $0.01 in Q3 fiscal \u201915, and negative $0.09 to $0.10 in Q4 fiscal \u201915. From a revenue perspective, in light of overall economic concerns, we are assuming that the industry declines in the consumer electronics category that we saw in the fourth quarter will continue. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that total company revenue and comparable store sales will remain slightly negative, similar to Q4 fiscal \u201914 in the first half of the year. But it\u2019s important to note that while it appears that our comparable store sales actually declined in January, in fact they were actually slightly better than the holiday. But due to the 30 basis point profit sharing payment that occurred in fiscal \u201913 that did not occur in fiscal \u201914, it appears that the cost was down, but in fact it was in line. Thank you, and with that, I\u2019m going to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Our first question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser - UBS : I was hoping to get a little more clarity on what\u2019s driving your expectation for the industry to be down in the first half of the year, and then how that translates to your comp performance. You have been taking share, so why wouldn\u2019t we necessarily believe that share gains could offset a difficult environment? Hubert Joly : As we go to expectations, we\u2019ve seen the industry trends in Q4. We also see, and many retailers are reporting [unintelligible] on this, an environment with economic uncertainty, retail challenges. And of course, in consumer electronics, a lot of the market is dependent on new product introductions, and so until you know what the products are going to be, it\u2019s hard to predict. So we find it\u2019s appropriate for us to be planning in a relatively proven fashion, if you will, that the market will not turn - until we see evidence that it turns, we should assume it will not turn - and focus on, as we have done in Q4, on what we can control. And so therefore the comment that Sharon made at the end of her observations that we are not planning positive comps during the first half of the year, though we won\u2019t complain if the comps turn positive, but in our planning.  And therefore, you highlight everything we\u2019ve said about more deeply, more quickly reducing the costs, improving our operational performance, driving the efficiencies, [unintelligible] the foundations for our future in store growth. So we\u2019re focusing on what we can control and approaching the year in a prudent fashion. It\u2019s more a planning assumption than a true forecast, if you will. Michael Lasser - UBS : What is the spread between the profitability of the online business and the store-based business now? If you could give some quantification of it? And how long do you think it will take to close that gap? Sharon McCollam : We\u2019re not going to quantify that. We think it\u2019s highly competitive, I think you would agree, as we compete with some of the giants. But what I would say is that what we expect is gradual and incremental improvement.  And as you can see on the cost side, once we get the Athena project up and running, productivity of email and other aspects of online, sea changes in performance. So I won\u2019t reiterate all of the initiatives we had online, but when you look at those and you look at how they will benefit conversion. The other area that is significant for us in the online channel is attach rate. And right now we just launched the ability to attach services. That\u2019s a new capability that we brought on in Q4. But there is so much that needs to be done there, because you know that in our business, hardware comes at very low margins, and to improve the margin it\u2019s about the basket. So we have to be able, online, to compel the customer to fill out that hardware purchase with different services, accessories, etc. So those are the big opportunities for us online, but as you look at our investments, this is going to be gradual and incremental, and quite frankly, there\u2019s only one direction that we would expect it to be going. It\u2019s a multiyear journey, for sure. There is a distance between these two numbers today, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much opportunity. Operator : And our next question is from David Magee from SunTrust. David Magee - SunTrust : I have a question about the shops in the shops in 2013 and during the holiday. Net-net, how happy are you with the performance of those shops, and could we expect to see additional shops in 2014? Hubert Joly : The way we evaluate the shops in the shops is what the customers think, what the vendors think, and what we see. The customers have been very happy with the shopping experience, which is really transformational, very helpful. I think the vendors, I don\u2019t want to speak for them, maybe you can ask them directly, but let\u2019s say I think they\u2019re quite happy. And for us, the way we measure the aggregate performance increasingly is in the overall performance of the company, and it\u2019s definitely having a positive contribution. So while we\u2019re not making specific announcements today in our good tradition of talking about things once they are in place, you can expect more and better of the same in this fiscal year. Operator : And our next question is from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Your online business was up 25%. Your retail business was down 5%. I think some of the historical definitions of retail, looking at things on a per square foot or per store basis, are getting a little bit archaic. Can you talk to us a little bit about the behavior of your customer and how your revenue per active customer is looking, and if your online initiatives are making new customers, or just kind of preventing existing ones from defecting? Hubert Joly : You\u2019re absolutely right that thinking about the two channels independently makes no sense anymore, even though technically you can track where the transaction is completed. What we see is the [unintelligible] of our shopping experience is online. Customers start their shopping experience online. And that\u2019s why our strategic investments in the online shopping experience both with traffic and the experience on the site is fundamental. It\u2019s fundamental to our online business, and to our store business.  So throughout the company, it\u2019s online first. The way our merchants are now thinking about the overall strategy, they spend so much time on that path, and improving the shopping experience. Of course, there\u2019s no blue shirt on the site, so you have to expand the shoppability of the site. Now, whether or not the transaction gets completed on the site, for us, is a little bit irrelevant. This is up to the customer. We don\u2019t have a bias. Even though the economics in the short term are different, we don\u2019t have a bias. We\u2019re so incredibly customer focused, and so we drive this based on what the customer wants to do. And I don\u2019t know, Sharon, if there\u2019s anything you want to add to this. Sharon McCollam : No, I think also that when you look at the competitive advantage that we have, realistically we have a store within 15 minutes of the U.S. population. So when you think about that, and you think about the online channels being the window into our business, the one thing that our online competitors cannot do is give it to them now, at this moment. And there are some abilities out there that are being developed, but if I want control of my purchase, we have a [moat] that makes it very easy for the customer to be served where and when they want to be served. The interesting fact about that, which Hubert alluded to, is that today a very high percentage of our online sales actually are customers that picked the inventory up in our stores. And we love that, because that gives us the opportunity to interact with the customer, that gives us the opportunity to continue to build that personal relationship with the customer, and going forward we see that as a tremendous competitive advantage as we continue to get better and better at it. And we\u2019re making some very significant investments in that area so that the customer has a completely seamless experience as they go through the entire process. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : I appreciate that. I\u2019m also curious if you guys have a way of measuring whether or not you\u2019re attracting new customers with these initiatives, or whether we\u2019re kind of preventing customers from defecting the channel. Hubert Joly : I\u2019m sorry. I knew I was not completely answering your question. It\u2019s both. A significant portion of our growth is coming from new customers, and one of our key opportunities, by the way, as a company, is to expand our presence and become the preferred brand for the Millennial population. We do extremely well with the Boomers, I think we have opportunities with the Millennials, and our online push is going to be very helpful from that standpoint. And of course online is a way to expand the relationship with existing customers.  So it\u2019s really both, and we\u2019ll continue to push in these areas. But I\u2019ll highlight some of the opportunities we have : attract new customers, expand the relationship with existing customers, and expand our share of wallet as we look at the various buying opportunities they have. Sharon McCollam : And we saw that in the fourth quarter. In Hubert\u2019s remarks, he talked about the fact that we relaunched My Best Buy and the credit card. We saw a significant number of new members doing My Best Buy. In addition to that, we saw a higher penetration of customers using our financing and our credit card. So again, engaging that customer and putting our arms around then so that long term, when they look to where they want to buy their consumer electronics, they will choose Best Buy. Hubert Joly : In fact, I would like to highlight one thing. One thing that\u2019s very gratifying, both for the quarter and the year, is to see how customers are responding. Because we\u2019re gaining market share, so that\u2019s clear. And while the top line comps are slightly down, of course it\u2019s after the effects of deflation. From a transaction standpoint, customers are voting with their feet, both online and in aggregate, and giving us more of their business. So the combination of enhanced price competitiveness and improved customer experience, resulting in these gains, shows the strength of the Best Buy franchise and the foundations, the platform we have for growth looking ahead. That\u2019s very, very important. Operator : And next is Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank : Can you discuss the promotion activity currently? What has changed since the holidays? It sounds to me, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, that the holidays just got extremely brutal and promotional and maybe things are more normal now. And so how do we therefore then think about gross margin trends for 2015 relative to that decline that you saw in the fourth quarter? Sharon McCollam : In my prepared remarks, I mentioned that in January we saw a less promotional environment. So once we exited the holiday, while it is still more promotional than a year ago from a cadence through the quarter point of view, we clearly saw the promotional environment be mitigated. As we look forward to 2015, obviously in the forecasts or the estimates that I gave you, one of those investments is pricing.  And on a year over year basis, as you know, from Q1 to Q2 to Q3 to Q4, we had two pieces of our pricing. One is structural, and then one is the competitive side of it, and price matching, etc. So as we progress through 2015, in Q1 as an example, all the investments we made in Q2, Q3, and Q4 were not in Q1 last year. So in Q1 we\u2019re seeing the biggest impact, and then it starts to mitigate in Q2, and then in Q3 it mitigates again.  And then of course our perspective, as Hubert said, is that we believe that even in an equal environment of promotional cadence next holiday, we believe that based on the tools and the marketing and the capabilities that we\u2019re building this year that our marketing effectiveness is going to be substantially better, and that when we go into the fourth quarter, even in that kind of an environment, we would see a much better margin outcome. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it for 2015. Operator : Next we have Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Gary Balter - Credit Suisse : You went into Christmas kind of prepared, and then Walmart and Amazon and Target and everybody else went crazy. As we go into next Christmas, what do you envision will have changed? Will you have more vendor support? Will there be better control over UPC? How do you envision Christmas happening? Because it seems like every year we hit that point and people go whacko on pricing. Hubert Joly : A key thing that we are working on is we continue to improve capabilities of the foundational elements that I was talking about. Let me highlight a few. One is our marketing and promotional effectiveness. The ability for us to communicate to our customers in a relevant and more personalized fashion, we think, as we develop it gradually, is going to be helpful compared to blast emails only talking about price. So we think that\u2019s the first one. The second thing is that continued improvements of the shopping experience. Those, as I think Sharon and I highlighted, are how on the site we are going to continue to make these improvements. Similarly, the shopping experience in the stores. So our strategy is to be price competitive and to build meaningful customer differentiation in terms of the unique value propositions we can offer to them as well as how we talk to them about this. So these are new capabilities that we are developing and that we think are going to be helpful. Are we\u2019re planning the year with the assumption that all of a sudden the wolves are going to become sheep? No, of course not. And we\u2019re going to continue to be in there ready to compete and so forth. It is possible that what happened during holiday, the players, the industry, will be, you used the word \u201ccrazy\u201d, I\u2019m not going to say our competitors are crazy, but the intensity may go down. But we\u2019ll focus again on what we can control, which is what we do for our customers, how we talk to them, and then of course our efficiencies. Sharon McCollam : And then I\u2019d just like to add to that that there\u2019s a couple of other things that we did this year that we, because of the timing of our transformation, when Hubert came in, etc., a lot of these things got launched in October, right before the holiday season. So take My Best Buy, the launch of the new credit card, some of the ecommerce capabilities. We put new buying guides on the website. There was a litany of things that we did. Obviously, when you do that you are putting in new capability, you are learning from those capabilities, and a year down the road is like a lifetime. So all of these programs, all of this investment, which was substantial, as you know, you can see our capex, that going into 2015 holiday we are going to have a lot more experience in that.  The other area that Hubert alluded to was pricing. We are investing in pricing capabilities this year. He\u2019s said from the day he started that we\u2019ve had a very underdeveloped pricing, modeling capability in the company. So when you start working on those things, they make a substantial difference, and we will continue to invest in those all year. They\u2019ll get better and better, and by the time we get into holiday, we think that we\u2019ll be able to put all of those together and come to market and to our customer in a substantially more compelling way. Operator : And next is David Schick with Stifel. David Schick - Stifel: I\u2019d like to go back to online. Your online sales have accelerated quite nicely, 10% up into the teens. It even looks like the accelerated from holiday to the full quarter. So out of the holiday. How much of that is just the way consumers are thinking and interacting with Best Buy, the way you talked about prior, or how much of that is new capabilities you\u2019re turning on and/or anything you\u2019re doing with compensation for store associates or measurement regarding the online trend? Hubert Joly : I think you\u2019re absolutely right to note the acceleration. And we hope to continue to accelerate the acceleration. And we have to wait now. I think because [unintelligible] we\u2019re gaining share online, which of course is our goal. We have some catching up to do. So this is the result of more traffic going to the site, and we are doing a better job converting that traffic, both on the site and then in the stores. So to take some examples of the latter meaning, the new capabilities, that\u2019s [unintelligible] ship from store. We had highlighted how, in the past, a portion of the traffic on the site, looking for a product, the product was not available in the online distribution centers, but was available in the stores. The unlocking of ship from store, up to 400 stores doing [unintelligible], now all of the stores, has allowed us to accelerate the online growth in a significant fashion. Our in store pickup capabilities are a very strong competitive advantage. It\u2019s roughly half of the online purchases that are picked up in the store, showing how meaningful our stores are as an asset. And please know that at Best Buy the store general managers and their teams are compensated not only on the brick and mortar revenue, but on the holistic revenue, and clearly with all of our stores now involving ship from store, they completely get it.  And increasingly, the focus in the store, same as online, is the product is not available in the store, how can I get it to you? From another store? From our DC? And not available is not part of our vocabulary, and finding an answer is always part of our vocabulary.  So I think we are appealing to new customers, and gradually, we\u2019re doing a better job of responding to our customers. Sharon McCollam : Another very important aspect of that, especially in holiday this year, was the implementation of a new search engine on our website. Earlier last year we talked to you about the fact that the search engine that was operating on the site was nearly 10 years old. And customers were coming to the site and they were searching for products and of course the search engine was not robust enough for them to find what they were looking for.  And when customers are trained by companies like Google, I type it in and it shows up, that\u2019s what they expect. And they\u2019re not going to type very many times until they get bored and walk away. The new search engine is state of the art technology and these search engines get smarter over time.  Again, this gets into the discussion of the fact that we launched it right before holiday and again, it\u2019s getting better and better as we move forward. But during holiday, the new search engine certainly made a substantial difference as well, another investment that we made that made a big difference. Operator : And our final question comes from David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets. David Strasser - Janney Capital Markets : One question around pricing optimization, I guess. You had talked about that in the past. Is there an opportunity there as you go into this year? Where does that play into sort of what you\u2019ve talked about? And I guess along those lines, during the call you had mentioned vendor support, and I was just sort of curious if you could give a little bit more detail how that vendor support changed from December to January and helped the gross margin from what you had seen over holiday and sort of how that happened? Hubert Joly : So price optimization, our strategy is to be price competitive, and we will continue to invest in that, as we\u2019ve done last year. But of course you can be smart about it. And pricing is a very sophisticated science, so I would highlight a couple of areas to think about.  One is marketing and promotional effectiveness. I don\u2019t know any company in the world that doesn\u2019t have opportunities in this area, and believe me, we do. So making sure that the promotions we do have the right return on investment. It\u2019s back to relevant communication to the customers of how we talk to them, to whom, when, and how. And then there\u2019s also tactical optimization. I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail, but there\u2019s more optimization really at the regional level, and so forth. As it relates to vendors, I\u2019m not going to give a lot of color around this, but one of the key assets that has always struck me ever since I joined the company is how important Best Buy is for key vendors and [unintelligible] to their success. And so our teams work closely with them. There were some dialogs after the holidays, and there was good contribution, as is always the case. There was nothing extraordinary, but until it\u2019s in the bank, you don\u2019t necessarily bank on it. And so we\u2019ll continue to work with our vendor partners to optimize the business for the customers, for themselves, and for ourselves. So it was part of the surprise that changed our expectations as it relates to the EPS for the quarter. David Strasser - Janney Capital Markets : Any thoughts on buybacks? I know you\u2019ve kind of gone back and forth on that last year. Any further thoughts when you look at your cash balance and cash flow and stuff about this year and buyback? Sharon McCollam : We\u2019re going to continue to evaluate our cash balance, obviously. Hubert and I believe deeply that putting a [fortress] on this balance sheet is really important. Obviously we know what bumps in the road look like, but we also know that over time there is a level of cash that makes sense and is a fortress and then there\u2019s the time when you exceed that. At this point, we are very comfortable with where we\u2019re sitting on our balance sheet and we\u2019ll be talking about this over the next 12 months. But at this time, we do not have any plans on a share buyback. Operator : Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Hubert for closing comments. Hubert Joly : Thanks, everyone, and before I close, I absolutely have to say something, which is of course these accomplishments that we\u2019re excited about would not have been possible without the dedication, the commitment, the hard work of the entire Best Buy team throughout the country and the world, and our vendor partners. And I have to honor them for their [unbelievable] contributions.  And also I have to thank all of you and our customers, and hopefully all of you are customers, for the business, and your ongoing loyalty and support to our company and our brand. And with this, I would like to thank you for your attention, your continued interest in our company. I wish you a very good day. Thank you all.",

Welcome to Best Buy's First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 12 PM Eastern Time today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Mollie O'Brien: Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our President and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. As usual, the media will be participating in this call in a listen-only mode. This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings release that we issued earlier today. They both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release. Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to consumer electronics or CE, industry trends and our market share. Share gain is determined by reference to information from the NPD Group and other industry sources. The CE industry, as defined by the NPD Group, includes TV, desktop and notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging, and other categories. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services. We would also like to note that in today's earnings release and conference call, we'll be referring to comparable store sales as comparable sales. We believe this change in nomenclature better reflects our multi-channel business, particularly in light of the continuous strong growth in our domestic comparable online sales. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Mollie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter results and then update you on the progress we've made against our Renew Blue priorities. Then I will turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. So, first our results. In the first quarter, we delivered just over $9 billion in revenue and a better-than-expected $0.33 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. So as expected, domestic comparable sales declined 1.3% in a context where sales in the consumer electronics industry continued to decline. Nevertheless, we achieved market share gains in the US, fueled by our improved price competitiveness and an enhanced customer experience focused on advice, service and convenience. This was evidenced by our 250 basis-point year-over-year improvement in net promoter score. Our non-GAAP operating income rate improved 30 basis points, driven by an SG&A cost reduction of $161 million or 105 basis points as a percent of revenue, partially offset by a 75 basis point decline in gross profit rate. Now, excluding the rate pressure from our previously communicated negative impacts, including the economics of our new credit card agreement, increased product warranty costs, and structural investments in pricing, our gross profit rate would have increased for the first time in several quarters due to the execution of our Renew Blue initiatives and more effective management of our promotional initiatives. Let's now turn to the progress of our Renew Blue transformation. On our last call, I outlined our 24-months Renew Blue roadmap to address three key business imperatives. That is improving operational performance, building foundational capabilities to unlock future growth strategies, and leveraging our unique assets to create a differentiated value proposition that is meaningful to our customers and our vendors. The roadmap we outlined is built around the following areas : merchandising, marketing, online, stores, Geek Squad services, supply chain, cost structure, and employee engagement. And I'm happy to provide today some highlights of our progress in a number of these areas. The first of these areas is merchandising. During the quarter, we continued to add compelling and differentiated in-store customer experiences in several key categories including appliances, home theater, and mobile. In the appliance category, we opened six new Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a- store, and expect to add up to 50 more this year. In home theater, we opened two new Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a- store and expect to add up to 20 more this year. To-date, our existing fleet of Pacific Kitchen & Home and Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a store are outperforming our initial expectations. Also, in home theater, based on the success of our existing vendor partnerships, we're launching two new partnerships, one with Samsung and one with Sony. By the end of the third quarter, we expect to roll out 500 Samsung Entertainment and 350 Sony Experience stores-within-a-store. This will represent the first major merchandising transformation in Best Buy's home theater department in almost 10 years and is intended to make it easier for customers to discover and appreciate the newest rapidly evolving home theater technology. In the mobile category during the quarter, we introduced the selling of new installment billing plans with Sprint and Verizon, and we\u2019ll begin selling AT&Ts late in the second quarter. These rollouts are significant, because customer adoption of these plans has been growing and our mobile business has been enabled to sell them since they were first introduced in the fall of last year. Furthermore, Best Buy is the first and today the only national retailer to launch installment billing plans with multiple carriers. The next area where we made progress this quarter is marketing. During the quarter, we continued to evolve marketing to more targeted, personalized, and relevant customer communication, including continuing to shift away from traditional TV advertising to more targeted and relevant digital marketing. We also began to leverage the early benefits of our new customer database, which we call Athena. These benefits include an increase in marketable e-mail addresses, the ability to target customer segments with specific offers, and the ability to send increasingly relevant e-mails. As Athena has only been recently populated, the additional systems necessary to dynamically utilize the data are still in development, and we're only in the very early stages of being able to personalize marketing messages to individual customers. We do believe, however, that with the Athena foundation in place, we will see improvements in marketing effectiveness every quarter as our understanding of our customers improves and new personalization capabilities are rolled out. In our online business, we continue to leverage our ship-from-store, digital marketing, and enhanced site functionality to drive a 29% increase in domestic comparable online sales. We also leverage ship-from-store to drive improved margins on clearance and end-of-life inventory that has been historically trapped in our stores. Our ship-from-store capability allows us to expose this inventory to our online customers, and with this exposure, we're beginning to achieve higher margins. We also enhanced our customer shopping experience around gifting with inspirational gift centers for Valentine's Day, Easter, and Mother's Day and continue to raise customer engagement by increasing our product reviews by more than 20% since the last quarter. Between now and holidays, as we continue to execute on the transformation of our e-commerce platform, we'll keep improving the shopping experience by implementing an improved homepage design, a more robust and streamlined wish list, significantly richer visual and editorial content, and enhanced search and navigation capabilities. We will also add returns to open-box inventory to the online assortment, enhance the online scheduling of home delivery and installation, and make it possible for customers to see their historical Geek Squad service plan purchases when they log into My Best Buy. In our retail stores during the quarter, we implemented the changes to the field and store structure that we outlined in our last call. In essence, we did three things. We consolidated and simplified the field organizational structure. We reorganized the field structure around key markets with the goal of having a local strategy for each of those markets, and we reduced the number of management-level roles within the stores. And so, while we've lowered our labor costs, we have increased the percentage of our retail labor that is customer-facing. In our Geek Squad services business, during the quarter, we continued to reduce our legacy cost structure through operational efficiencies and significantly improved our services\u2019 net promoter score. Our services revenue declined in line with our expectations, reflecting the expected negative pressure that we discussed last quarter related to the mobile warranty business, as Sharon will discuss later. Looking ahead in services, our team is working on refining our existing service offerings, improving the merchandising of our services, and building new offerings that meet the needs of customers in the context of today's rapidly evolving technology environment. In our supply chain, we continued to leverage and transform our distribution fulfillment capabilities. As we discussed in our last call, Q1 was the first full quarter that we were able to ship out of all of our 1,400 retail stores. This capability has only significantly contributed to our online growth, but also to our online conversion and net promoter score by meaningfully reducing our out-of-stock messages. It is also allowing us to increasing our speed of delivery to our customers, which we expect to more significantly leverage as we continue to build the more rapid delivery and fulfillment model. In building this model, just this week, we made substantial changes in our distribution operating model to allowing work schedules with customer demand, including expending our days and hours of operation in both retail replenishment and online fulfillment. This will allow us to get inventory to our customers faster in both channels. In the second quarter, we plan to begin exposing return open-box inventory that is currently trapped in any individual store to both our online customers and customers in other Best Buy stores. This exposure is significant, because in general, individual stores do not have the breadth of traffic necessary to optimize the margin recovery on these products and the majority of open-box type consumer electronics is sold online. This exposure is also a critical component of our returns, replacements and damages margin enhancement initiative and the early results are encouraging. Relating to our cost reduction initiatives, in the first quarter, we eliminated an additional $95 million in annualized cost, taking our total Renew Blue cost reductions to $860 million towards our new target of $1 billion. As relates to our international segment, we're continuing to execute against our Renew Blue priorities and we've made considerable progress on our cost reduction initiatives, while increasingly shifting our focus towards our topline opportunities. So all together, while we remain mindful of the fact that we still have a lot to do in our Renew Blue transformation, the first quarter results clearly demonstrated the progress we are making towards improving our operational performance, building foundational capabilities and leveraging our unique assets to create a differentiated value proposition. I would therefore like to express my appreciation and gratitude to our entire team for their commitment to our mission and the impact of their hard work on our results. And I will now turn the call over to Sharon to cover more details on our first quarter financial performance. Sharon McCollam : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our fourth quarter press release. As Hubert said, during the first quarter, we continued to make meaningful progress against our Renew Blue priorities, which resulted in a better than expected non-GAAP operating margin rate of 2.3% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.33. These results versus the 70 basis points to 90 basis points of operating margin rate pressure that we previously expected were primarily driven by a significant improvement in the effectiveness of our promotional initiatives as well as a less promotional external environment, a more rapid than expected realization of our Renew Blue cost savings and $0.03 per diluted share non-recurring financial benefit associated with the transitional economics of our new credit card agreement. I will now talk about our first quarter financial results versus last year. Enterprise revenue declined 3.3% to just over $9 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.01 to $0.33. This increase is primarily driven by the flow-through of our Renew Blue cost saving, more effective management of our promotional initiatives and the $0.03 per diluted share non-recurring benefit associated with the transitional economics of our new credit card agreement. As expected, these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of lower volume, the ongoing economics of our new credit card agreement, our higher mobile warranty costs and structural investments in price competitiveness. Domestic revenue of $7.8 billion declined 2.1% versus last year. This decline was primarily driven by a 1.3% decline in comparable sales and a revenue decline of $63 million or 80 basis points due to the less favorable ongoing economics of the new credit card agreement. These declines were partially offset by $16 million or 20 basis points of non-recurring financial benefit associated with the transitional economics of the new credit card agreement. Domestic online revenue of $639 million increased 29.2% on a comparable basis due to substantially improved inventory availability made possible by the chain-wide rollout of our ship-from-store capability, a higher average order value, increased traffic driven by greater investment in online digital marketing, and a higher number of online orders being placed in our retail stores. As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased 190 basis points to 8.2% versus 6.3% last year. From a merchandising perspective, growth in computing, gaming and appliances was more than offset by declines in other categories, including tablets, services and home theater. Service comparable store sales declined 13.5%, reflecting the expected negative pressure that we discussed last quarter relating to the mobile warranty category. Specifically, this decline was primarily driven by lower mobile repair revenue due to successfully implementing initiatives to decreased claim severity and higher mobile warranty premium costs which translate into lower commission revenue. International revenue of $1.3 billion declined 10.5% versus last year. This decline was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 5.8%, driven by Canada, China and Mexico, the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the loss of revenue from large format store closures in China, partially offset by revenue from new store openings in Mexico. Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise gross profit rate for the first quarter was 22.4% versus 23.1% last year, a decline of 75 basis points. The domestic gross profit rate declined 70 basis points to 22.7% versus 23.4% last year. This decline was primarily due to a 60-basis point negative impact related to the less favorable ongoing economics of the new credit card agreement, proceeds from legal settlements that occurred in Q1 fiscal '14 that did not recur in Q1 fiscal '15, increased product warranty costs primarily relating to the mobile category, and structural investments in price competitiveness particularly in accessories. These declines were partially offset by the realization of our Renew Blue cost reductions and other supply chain cost containment initiatives, more effective management of our promotional initiatives, and higher inventory shrinkage in Q1 '14 that did not recur in Q1 '15. In addition, the gross profit rate benefited from a 15-basis point impact from the non-recurring financial benefits associated with the transitional economics of the new credit card agreement. The international gross profit rate was 20.5% versus 21.3% last year. This 80 basis point rate decline was primarily driven by an increased mix of lower-margin gaming and computing products and increased promotional activity in Canada. Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.8 billion or 20% of revenue versus 21.1% last year, a decline of over $161 million or 105 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.5 billion or 19.6% of revenue versus 20.5% of revenue last year, a decline of $105 million or 90 basis points. This rate decline was primarily driven by the realization of Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management throughout the company. These impacts were partially offset by Renew Blue investments in online growth. International non-GAAP SG&A was $284 million or 22.6% of revenue versus 24.3% of revenue last year, a decline of $56 million or 170 basis points. This rate decline was primarily driven again by Renew Blue cost reductions and tighter expense management in Canada and China. As we look forward to the second and third quarters, we are expecting to see ongoing industry-wide sales decline in many of the consumer electronics categories in which we compete. We are also expecting ongoing softness in the mobile phone category, as consumers eagerly await highly anticipated new product launches. Consequently, absent any major product launches, we are expecting comparable sales to be negative in the low-single digits in both the second and third quarters. From an operating income rate perspective, as we outlined last quarter, we are expecting the negative P&L impact that we have been discussing each quarter, including ongoing investments in price competitiveness, our Renew Blue SG&A investments and the negative impact of our new credit card agreement to continue, but to be significantly offset by our Renew Blue cost reductions. Also, as we discussed last quarter, in the first quarter, we reorganized certain foreign legal entities to simplify our overall tax structure, which resulted in an accelerated non-cash tax benefit of approximately $1.01. Due to its materiality, this benefit was treated as a non-GAAP adjustment in today's first quarter earnings. This benefit, however, has historically been recognized on a periodic basis. And as a result of the acceleration, there will be no future earnings benefit for book purposes. Therefore, the company will have a higher income tax rate going forward on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We estimate that the impact of this and other known discrete income tax items will affect the quarterly fiscal '15 diluted earnings per share on a year-over-year basis as follows : flat to positive $0.01 in Q2, flat to negative $0.01 in Q3, and then negative $0.09 to $0.10 in Q4. For cash tax purposes, though, the benefit from the reorganization will continue to be amortized. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Chris Horvers - JPMorgan: So, I wanted to talk about the ship-from-store and what you've seen so far in terms of the benefit to margin. You have the clearance aspect ahead, but in terms of the end-of-life inventory, how should we dimensionalize that and how much of the product in the store can be shipped out, how much of the assortment is on average on markdown in any particular quarter, and what sort of lift are you seeing in terms of net improvement on a markdown basis? Sharon McCollam : The answer to all of your questions is yes, we are seeing benefits. In ship-from-store, the amount of inventory that has actually been unlocked represents about two-thirds of our inventory. So where we may be carrying approximately $3 billion of total inventory, about $2 billion of that has been unlocked to the customers. We are just now working on pricing. As it relates to clearance inventory, we're working through it category-by-category. Obviously, nothing gets better with age at Best Buy, so a gradual movement into new pricing strategies as it relates to clearance inventory and end-of-life inventory is a thoughtful strategy, and of course one that we would implement as we move forward, and that's what we're doing. But we have already seen margin benefit, which was delivered in today's results through the utilization of ship-from-store, and we expect that to continue to grow as we progress through the year, and the demand planners learn more about how to use ship-from-store as a pricing leverage tool. The big opportunity is from the merchant organization, where they are now pulling and pushing levers in order to move that inventory through the system faster. And of course, it addresses the problem that we've talked about for several quarters, where when we get to the point of clearance, i.e., end of life after clearance, when one store is significantly out of balance, we have historically had to take very deep markdowns in order to clear it, because we don't have enough foot traffic in order to move that inventory through that store absent a price lever. And now, we're going to be able to balance the inventory theoretically by opening it up and exposing it to the online customer. So you should expect to be seeing more positive, and the ship-from-store functionality in the company is only getting better and there is more to come. Chris Horvers - JPMorgan: Can you talk about the average amount of that inventory that's on markdown at any particular time, and what sort of your average markdown is for an end-of-life product? Sharon McCollam : I think that's highly competitive. So, I'm not going to disclose it here on the call today. What I would say is that if you think about our product cycle, the consumer electronics product cycle is built on the premise of obsoleting last year's model and bringing in this year's model, so it is a substantial percentage of our business that we are running through on clearance or end-of-life basis. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. Greg Melich - ISI Group : I want to follow up a little bit on the dynamic of Renew Blue versus the margin trends that you discussed in reference to your outlook. Basically as we go forward, Sharon, you mentioned that we expect to significantly offset those pressures with all the good things happening in Renew Blue. Does that mean we can fully offset it in the next few quarters like we did in the first quarter or do you think that there's something to do with the timing and the year-over-year impact that will just make it harder to get the $160 million of cost reductions that you got in the first quarter? Sharon McCollam : Yes, as you come into Q2, I think we will substantially offset it. When you get into Q3, we will be more than offsetting it at a slight level, and then by the time you get to Q4, obviously when you're picking out this much costs, it's going to have a significantly bigger benefit in Q4, and that's how it should look. The real message in the outlook today when you look at the first call estimates is where we see the comp in Q2 and Q3. The consumer electronics industry, as defined by NPD, tracked by NPD in Q2, was again down 2.6%. That's in the press release in one of the foot notes. Obviously, we're gaining share in multiple categories. So as we look at what has to happen with the first call estimates that we've seen out there is that we have to address this consumer electronics softness, which we believe is being greatly driven by a lack of innovation. We need some new excitement in those categories, and we are going to continue to work towards getting back to positive comp store sales. And we've got a lot of ideas, and you\u2019ve got to look at that online growth this quarter, it is just significant. But the real key message that we wanted you guys to take away today is the pressure on the topline. Greg Melich - ISI Group : And if I could, just remind us when we cycle those things like the credit agreement change in terms of the pressure on gross margin? Sharon McCollam : I'm sorry, I missed that question. Greg Melich - ISI Group : So, basically the things you talked about, the credit pressure given the new program you have, when do you cycle that change? Sharon McCollam : Each one of them is slightly different. If you noticed in the call, by Q4 you've basically cycled all of them. Warranty drops off at the end of Q2. And then, the others continue until you get to Q4. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets : I had a question in terms of the installment billing. I know that was a major headwind in Q4, and I guess I'm just wondering how much of a headwind was that in Q1, particularly given the fact that you're still not set up with AT&T? Hubert Joly : The installment billing, the fact that we're now starting to service is going to be helpful going forward. We say, though, that in the phone category, in this current quarter, there will be impact on the market of no new phones and the expectation of customers, maybe important new products coming later in the year. So while we're excited by the ability to delight our customers with the range of options and the fact that we are the only national retailer to offer multiple carriers, we are also aware of substantial softness from an overall customer demand in the short term. Anthony Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets : And just one related follow-up. So would you say, I mean, looking more at Q1 that not having installment billing set up at all three carriers was more of a headwind than the lack of innovation, or would you say that the lack of innovation was the bigger headwind in the mobile category? Hubert Joly : Sequentially, the lack of innovation was quite significant. Remember we already had in Q4 the absence of installment billing. So sequentially, the lack of innovation was the major driver. We expect, Anthony, the installment billing to gradually pick up as store associates become effective and efficient at selling this. And so we're quite excited by this. But again, I want to highlight that in the short term, we are likely to see some softness. So over time, installment billing will be bigger and then we'll see what the new products do later in the year. Sharon McCollam : Just adding to Hubert's comments, in the first quarter because of the timing of the rollout of the system for the two carriers in the first quarter, we did not have a full quarter of the benefit. And to our mobile results in the first quarter, it was quite immaterial. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Gary Balter - Credit Suisse : I heard conversations, Sharon, you gave us some outlook for second quarter, third quarter. But looking at my model and everybody else's, over 50% of your profits are in Q4. Last year, you had some serious traffic drivers or lack of traffic drivers, as you discussed, and you had gross margins that probably dropped more than you would've expected, because it seems like everybody is reacting to Target and NPD data. I recognize we're a few months away, but as we look out to Q4, can you talk about some of the things that you see as changing year-over-year? Sharon McCollam : Absolutely. I think as we enter Q4, the in-store vendor experiences this year are going to be significant. We've talked about the ones that we've already been working through. We had the Samsung, of course, and then Microsoft. And now with our new partnerships coming into Q4, which is actually a time of the year when home theater clearly stands out, we are very optimistic about the opportunity to showcase such an impressive lineup of television and home theater for this holiday. In addition to that, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making on our promotional initiatives. Last fourth quarter, we talked about it, I don't need to reiterate here that we believe that we could have made some significantly improved decisions around the promotional activity and we have put systems in place and people in place. So the rigger around the promotional investments has been taken, I would call it, to a new level. And by Q4, you know those always grow gradually and incrementally. So I believe by Q4 that we will see that as well. Another area that we are investing in and we are seeing progress and again it's gradual and incremental is in strategic pricing. Now that does not mean that we will not be continuing to invest in structural pricing, which we've already talked about. But offsetting that, in the other pricing within the company that we do, which is every day, every product and timing of changing pricing, we believe that this has not been a strong capability. Hubert had said that actually since he joined the company. And we have been progressing in that area as well. So as we come into Q4, I believe that you will see a greater level of sophistication in both pricing and promotions. Additionally, of course, when I just responded to Greg is that we will be then comping all of our notable negative impacts. And as it relates to the services business, of course you noticed or could take note in the prepared remarks this morning about the fact that the work that we have done to reduce severity, while that reduces our revenue because obviously we're not fixing as many things as we subcontract for AIG and others, we have made significant progress in our selling process and in our services programs. And I expect again gradually and incrementally to see those be beneficial to us as we get into the really important fourth quarter. I think we all believe that there's going to be some exciting innovation in several of our categories including mobile some time this year and of course that's an opportunity to protect those valuable products for our customers and we expect to continue to remain very focused on our services. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray : So the consumer electronics industry declines were pretty consistent in Q1 and Q4. Are you expecting those declines to get worse as we go forward here in Q2 and Q3? Sharon McCollam : I don't believe that we have any reasons to necessarily believe that they are going to get worse. There wasn't much innovation in Q4 compared to Q1. So I don't know that we are viewing it as substantially worse. We think that mobile without the newness and the anticipation is going to be affected by something different. And remember, NPD does not track mobile. You need to focus on those categories and which ones, but mobile is actually not in those categories. So we think where you're going to see it, the additional pressure is going to be in Q2 and Q3 in mobile. Peter Keith - Piper Jaffray : I want to ask a separate question just on some of the management changes. Hubert, could you address the change of leadership with US stores and then also with Jude Buckley moving out of that co-merchandising role and into a marketing role? I know he has since departed, but I'm wondering how you're changing things at the top there? Hubert Joly : What I would say, Peter, is that I'm very proud of our team. We have in our executive team some very strong leaders and we've been able over the last 18 months to significantly not only deliver, but strengthen the management team. My colleague on this phone call being a great example of that, of course, with Sharon. There's one area where we need to continue to strengthen our capabilities, I would say, which is the whole area of developing great customer experiences and marketing. And so we'll be focused on that. Now each individual case and I'm not going to comment on individual leaders, but again I want to reiterate how proud I am of our team commitment to our mission, the talent that exists and we'll continue to strengthen it, particularly in this customer experience and marketing arena. As relates to the new leader of stores, Shari Ballard, I want to recognize her publicly. Our team is a combination of people who've been at Best Buy for a long time and newcomers. Shari is an amazing leader. I personally had the opportunity to work closely with her in the last 18 months. She is very strategic. She is performance-oriented. She knows retail inside out. She has grown tremendously. She is one of the most extraordinary leaders I've had the opportunity to work with. And already in the last few weeks, she took the leadership of our retail stores in the US. She tends to have a very meaningful impact. So we're very excited about Shari leading our store organization. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs : So you've already obviously been engaged in an aggressive cost cutting effort across the enterprise. But as we look at the relationship between your overall comps and your growth in online, it seems like the model would dictate some modest persistent sales decline in the stores. If you could just give us a sense over the long run how you're adjusting your model to make it more flexible on cost and how much room there is to sort of move with the migration to omni-channel as you optimize your cost structure. Hubert Joly : We're very pleased with the growth of our online business. I think 29% is a good number, and Sharon has outlined the key drivers of that. I would note one thing, which is increasingly going to be how to distinguish between online and store. And in many ways, of course we're moving to be a multi-channel retailer. But our ship-from-store do you count this in the store result or in online? Of course, we know that our store leaders are compensated and incentivized on the whole. Increasingly, we want our store associates to, if the product is not available in the store, to tell the customer, of course, I can get it to you, be it from DC, from another store and so forth. And we're very pleased with our multi-channel capabilities and how we can leverage that to serve an increasing number of customers. Now we are seeing, as any other retailer, a phenomenon which is a reduction of in-store traffic as customers spend more time researching online and many times closing the sale online and some of the times going into the stores. So we have the ability to flex the labor model. We've done some of that in Q1, lowering the overhead in the stores, which means that we are increasing the part that's variable and customer-facing of course. And one of the areas of focus of Shari is to look at how we can adjust dynamically the starting to the traffic store-by-store, but also day-by-day and hour-by-hour and category-by-category. Now over time, we've been very consistent in talking about the fact that we will continue to optimize our store footprint. We know that in the short term, our store contributing positively are our great assets. But over time, we'll see how all of this evolves, our traffic pattern continues to evolve, and how we are able to compensate some of them through our own growth initiatives. As we develop our personalization capabilities with Athena, we're gaining flexibility in adjusting our flow footprint. But this is something that will take place over multiple years. And so there're some of the things that we're thinking about as relates to that. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser - UBS: I wanted to follow-up on two comments made previously in the call. The first was on the prospect of innovation beyond mobile phones. As you alluded to the industry really does need to drive innovation. And I was hoping you could expand on where you think that will come from mostly around the holidays and then moving into next year. And then second, Sharon, you alluded to the potential for margin expansion in the third and fourth quarter, could you quantify how much margin expansion you think the enterprise could achieve during that time? Hubert Joly : As relates to category growth drivers, getting into the next several quarters, holiday and next year, I would list probably a small handful of them. One is in home theater, ultra-high definition TV. Obviously we do expect some traction there, A, because from the customer standpoint it's materially different; and B, because we will be the destination for ultra-high definition TV with our Samsung and Sony stores in the stores, our Magnolia design centers, et cetera. Second, we think a good deal in traction in gaming of course with the new platform cycle. And while early in the cycle, it's mainly hardware driven. Of course as the install base grows and as games developers and publishers will have had more time to bring new products to market, we will see the cycle gaining momentum. I think third is appliances. You've seen our continued growth in appliances, driven by the housing recovery and expansion of the appliance section, the Pacific Home & Kitchen performance. So it may be less technology-driven, but more underlying economics and our merchandizing initiatives. And of course, we're seeing good traction around computing. You've seen that with our Windows store in partnership with Microsoft. Beyond that, we've talked about, I think, the industry as a whole is focused on new categories around health and fitness and connected home, just may take longer to materialize and produce a big impact. But there is a ton of innovation going on there. So less impact on Q4 clearly, but looking at the next two or three years, areas of intense focus. So these are some of the things I wanted to highlight. Sharon McCollam : When you take my comments and you put them actually into the P&L, the gross profit rate in Q3 will be down. Remember that it is the Renew Blue cost reductions that are offsetting those pressures. And those pressures on a year-over-year basis, of course, are in Q3 and not so for Q4. So I want to be clear about your question was if it was the gross profit rate, I think you said the margin rate, and I don't know if you were specific about gross profit or operating margin. What you should see in Q3 is a stabilization of that operating margin. But of course, you're going to see the lower revenue. And then coming into Q4, where we're very hopeful there's the new innovation comes in as well, you should see an OI margin expansion in Q4 in light of the results of Q4 last year. Michael Lasser - UBS: And the magnitude of the increase will just depend on a variety of factors like the promotional environment, et cetera? Sharon McCollam : It is so clever how you guys do that. Michael Lasser - UBS: We try. Sharon McCollam : We are not giving guidance. Thank you, though. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies & Company. Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company: I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on your price investment activity, specifically accessories. That's been an area where you have had price gaps with competitors. I think some still even still exist. So I'm kind of curious what inning you are in on that investment, if you're seeing better growth in the category, better attachments to core purchases? Hubert Joly : So yes, our strategy is to be price competitive and that applies to the entire product lineup. We'll continue in the next several quarters this year to make targeted investments, so that we can continue to align. Of course, this is a complex field, because you have multiple categories, multiple competitors and so forth. But I must say I'm very pleased with the progress we're making in this area as well as the customer response in this area. So we'll continue in the next several quarters this year to make these investments. Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company: I'm not sure if I can sneak one more in, but you've had some new leadership in Canada in Geek Squad. I'm just curious if we can get an update on some of the initiatives particularly in light of the negative comps that we're seeing in both areas? Hubert Joly : So in Canada, our President is Ron Wilson. I was with him last week. He is a seasoned veteran of Best Buy. He's done a remarkable job adjusting the cost structure in Canada. Canada at this point in consumer electronics is a very, very soft market. We've seen significant industry declines. We're holding our own very well in comparison to the market. So very good job on the cost side. And the focus is shifting to driving the topline of course, along the same lines as our Renew Blue initiatives in the US. As relates to services, Chris Askew, who joined us about nine months ago, who is a 20-year industry veteran in the IT services industry, has done a very good job in a number of areas so far pertaining in particular to driving efficiencies. There is a lot of process improvements that he's been able to carry, materially improving the service quality around our various service lines. As we celebrate the 20 years birthday of Geek Squad this year, the focus there also is shifting to growth. So there is a lot of work he is leading around reviewing the existing service portfolio, the merchandizing, the marketing, the selling of these services in partnership with Shari Ballard in particular in the stores, as well as innovating. When you think about the needs of the customers in their connected home, there's significant opportunity for us to be their technology partner not just in terms of the installation of a service, but for the management of their entire services. So we have a pipeline of innovation that he is working in, in a very disciplined fashion. But of course it takes time to go from ideation to evaluation and then to launching the services. So a lot of work going on in this area. Sharon McCollam : And I'll just add to that that in our prepared remarks this morning, we actually added comments about the decline in services revenue. While we are going through this transition on these mobile warranty costs, we've referred to them as costs, because theoretically they are. But the way that shows up in the P&L, which I talked about is higher mobile warranty premium costs, actually end up in lower commission revenue. That is how the accounting for that played out. And then on the service, where we repair the products under those Geek Squad program, as we improve the actions we take to reduce severity, it reduces revenue, but improves profit. So after the call today, I'd be happy to go into more detail on that for anyone, because we could actually have a great performing services business, and as we work on improving our efficiency, it could have a negative impact on revenue, but a higher improvement on gross profit. So I think it's really important that everybody understand that, especially as we go through all the operational efficiencies that Chris is introducing for us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

(Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien:  Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our President and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. As usual, the media will be participating in this call in a listen-only mode. This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings release that we issued earlier today. They both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release. Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to consumer electronics or CE industry trends. The CE industry, as defined by the NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging, and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I will begin today with an overview of our second quarter results and then update you on the progress we\u2019re making against our Renew Blue priorities. Then I will turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. So first, our financial results. In the second quarter we delivered $8.9 billion in revenue and $0.44 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus $0.32 last year. The ongoing benefits of our Renew Blue cost reduction and other SG&A cost containment initiatives drove these better than expected results. On the top line as expected sales in the NPD track consumer electronics category declined 2.5% in-line with our domestic comparable sales decline of 2.0%. Like other retailers and as reflected in this quarter\u2019s performance we continue to see a shift in consumer behavior. Consumers are increasingly researching and buying online. As a result traffic to our brick and mortar stores continue to decline and yet our in-store conversion and online traffic continue to increase due to the execution of our Renew Blue strategy which is in direct alignment with this shift. Our Renew Blue strategy is designed to grow our online business, enhance our in-store customer experience and leverage out multi-channel capabilities or deliver to our customers great advice, service and convenience at competitive prices in the channel they want to be served. Each of these initiatives contributed to our second quarter results. And so I\u2019m pleased to update you today on the progress we\u2019re making against our renewable transformation road-map which is built around following areas. Merchandising, marketing, online, stores, Geek Squad services, supply chain, cost structure and employee engagement. So first of these areas is merchandising. We believe we\u2019re raising the bar in our retail channel by continuing to roll out compelling and differentiated customer experiences across major categories such as appliances, home theater and mobile. In the appliance category we opened 18 new Pacific Kitchen & Home stores within a store on our on track to end the year with approximately 115 stores versus 67 last year. In the Home Theater category we opened seven new Magnolia design center stores within the store and our on track to the end the year with approximately 50 stores versus 33 last year. Both of these premium stores within the store concepts continue to outperform our expectations. We also rolled out over 800 Samsung and Sony Home Theater stores within a store during the quarter. This represents the first major merchandising transformation in Best Buy\u2019s home theater department in almost 10 years. We believe that home theater transformation further solidifies our position as the destination for customers to discover and interact with industry leading home theater technology particularly ultra-high definition or 4k TVs and we\u2019re encouraged by the early consumer response to our expanded ultra-high definition assortments. We\u2019re excited about the future of this technology even though we believe that the impact to our business this year will be limited. In the mobile category in the second quarter we began offering customers the option to purchase installment billing plans with the Top 3 U.S. carriers. While mobile phone demand in the second quarter including year-over-year trading volume declined as customers wait for highly anticipated new product launches the penetration of installment billing progressively increased during the quarter and we believe we\u2019re well-positioned to capitalize on the new products when they are introduced. In the area of marketing, we made progress in our evolution from analog in mass to digital and targeted communications with our customers. During the quarter we continued to shift our marketing investment dollars towards digital media campaigns and away from print and television advertising. We\u2019re also leveraging our Athena customer database to pilot new targeted email campaigns, we\u2019re in the early stages of being able to personalize marketing messages to individual customers which we view as a 2 or 3 year journey. We do however expect to see gradual and incremental improvements in marketing effectiveness every quarter our customer insights improve and our new personalization capabilities are rolled out. In our online business in the second quarter we continue to leverage our ship from store, digital marketing and enhanced website functionality to drive a 22% increase in domestic comparable online sales. Similar to the first quarter ship from store represented over half of the online sales growth. We\u2019re also using ship from store to drive gross profit improvements on our clearance and end-of-life inventory by exposing it not only to our retail customers but also to our online customers. We also launched several customer facing improvements on the website to drive increased engagements in a more seamless online shopping experience including number one a new global homepage that is easier for customers to navigate, number two significantly richer visual and editorial content for the ultra-high definition, digital imaging in the health and wearables category. Number three, new text messaging options for order confirmation and delivery that are garnering significant customer adoption and number four visibility to customers Geek Squad purchases instead of their My Best Buy accounts on bestbuy.com. As we head into the back half of the year we will continue to launch online shopping experience improvements, such as additional product category we designed, expanded wish list capabilities and improved checkout process in an expanded and more inspirational holiday gift center. Of course we will also be continuing a significant behind the scenes work on the transformation of our e-commerce platform. In our retail stores the field and store structure changes we implemented last quarter are to-date generating results in-line with our expectations. We have consolidated and simplified the field organization, we organized to help drive local strategies and reduce the number of management level roles. In total what our year-over-year retail labor cost are now lower, other investment in customer facing labor including vendor funded labor has increased. While we still have much to do in reinvigorating the customer experience, we are making progress and are pleased to see our in-store experience contribute significantly to the 400 basis point improvements in our overall NPS or Net Promoter Score that we saw in the second quarter. In our Geek Squad Services business we continue to increase our net promoter scores and drive down cost to operational efficiencies. We also continue to focus on refining our existing service offerings, improving the merchandising of our services, and building new offerings that meet the needs of customers in the context of today\u2019s rapidly evolving technology environment. In our supply chain we continue to leverage and transform our distribution and fulfillment capabilities. In May, we implemented significant changes to our distribution operating model that aligned work schedules with customer demand including expanding our days and hours of operation. This implementation was seamless and we\u2019re now able to replenish inventory to our stores and deliver to our online customers faster which is both a competitive top line and improved customer service opportunity particularly in advance of the holiday season. We also continue to leverage our ship from store capability. Not only does it continue to be a significant contributor to our online sales growth, it has also been expanded to drive increased sales out of our retail stores. Let me explain. In the past when blue shirts were looking for a product that was out stock in a store the system they used could only see a variable inventory in the individual store and a distribution centers. Today using the exact same system the Blue Shirts can now see all available inventory in our distribution centers and our 1400 stores. As a result our Blue Shirts are gaining increased confidence in being able to serve their customer and drive incremental sales. In the area of returns, replacements and damages we continue to make progress in the second quarter including launching a company-wide awareness program for our Blue Shirts, our Geek Squad agents and our corporate support teams. This program is focused on raising awareness of the operational behaviors that are contributing to the over $400 million in annual losses that we have historically been incurring. The program is also rolling out new operating procedures to reduce these losses. These procedures include number one setting the right product the first time, number two, enforcing the company\u2019s return policy and increasing the frequency of exchanges. Number three inspecting return inventory, number four, culturally resetting in-store perception of the value of return inventory and number five exposing this inventory to our online shoppers. As we have consistently said this online exposure is critical to optimize margin recovery because the majority of open box inventory is searched for and purchased online. And in the second quarter we began offering Geek Squad certified open box inventory online primarily in the computing and tablet categories. In the fourth quarter as new systems are implemented we will begin offering additional open box inventory that is in excellent conditions which represents the majority of our open box returns. We\u2019re seeing early sales in margin improvements from the roll out of these new procedures. We expect to see stronger results as the program matures and we improve the online searchability and overall multichannel customer experience over the next several quarters. Relating to our overall cost reduction initiatives in the second quarter, we eliminated an additional $40 million in annualized cost taking a total renewable cost reductions to $900 million towards our target of $1 billion. Now as it relates to our international segment while we have made considerable progress in our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives we have substantial work to do on top line stabilization. To address this we\u2019re following the same kind of Renew Blue transformation roadmap that we\u2019re pursuing in the U.S. So to recap, while the other consumer electronics environment continued to be soft, the second quarter ended better than expected primarily due to strong expense control. In addition we made significant progress against our Renew Blue priorities and clearly demonstrated our increasing ability to tightly manage what we can control. And looking ahead our goal is to continue to create a significantly differentiated multi-channel customer experience such that every interaction customers have with us regardless of channel makes them a promoter of the Best Buy brands. In support of this we will be intensifying our investments in customer facing initiatives across both channels in the back half of the year and Sharon will elaborate on this later in the call. In fact I will now turn the call over to Sharon to cover more details on our second quarter financial performance and our financial outlook. Sharon McCollam :  Thank you Hubert and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter earnings results versus last year I would like to talk about them versus our expectation. As Hubert said during the quarter we continued to make meaningful progress against our Renew Blue priorities which resulted in a better than expected non-GAAP operating margin rate of 2.9% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.44. These results versus our expectations were primarily driven by stronger SG&A cost containment initiatives, greater promotional effectiveness and better performance of our new credit card agreement. I will now talk about the second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue declined 4% to 8.9 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 38% to $0.44 primarily driven by the flow-through of our Renew Blue cost savings and other cost containment initiatives. As expected the positive impact of these cost savings were partially offset by the negative impact of lower volume, higher year-over-year sales in the lower margin gaming and computing categories and the previously communicated negative impacts from our credit card agreement and structural price investments. Domestic revenue of 7.6 billion declined 2.4% versus last year. This decline was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 2% and a revenue decline of 20 million or 25 basis points due to the less favorable economics of the new credit card agreement. Domestic, comparable online revenue however increased 22% to 581 million due to substantially improved inventory availability made possible by the chain wide roll-out of shipped from store last January. A higher average order value and increased traffic driven by greater investment in online digital marketing. As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased a 160 basis points to 7.7% versus 6.1% last year. From a merchandising perspective growth in gaming, computing appliances and televisions was more than offset by declines in other categories including mobile phones, tablets and services. Services comparable sales declined 8.9% primarily driven by lower mobile repair revenue due to our success in decrease claim severity and frequency. Lower attach rates and higher mobile warranty premium costs which translate into lower commission revenue. These were partially offset by a factory warranty recovery related impact that occurred in Q2, fiscal \u201914 that did not recur this year. International revenue of 1.3 billion declined 12% versus last year. This decline was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 6.7%. The negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the loss of revenue from store closures in China. Turning now to the gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the second quarter was 23.1% versus 23.7% last year, an expected decline of 60 basis points. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate declined 50 basis points to 23.4% versus 23.9% last year. This decline was primarily due to a mix shift into the lower margin gaming and computing categories, structural investments and price competitiveness particularly in accessories a 20 basis point negative impact related to the less favorable economics as a new credit card agreement. These declines were partially offset by an increased mix of higher margin large screen television and the realization of our Renew Blue cost reductions and other supply chain cost containment initiatives. The international gross profit rate was 21.1% versus 22.3% last year. This 120 basis point decline was primarily driven by our Canadian business due to increased promotional activity and an increased mix into the lower margin gaming category. Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was 1.8 billion or 20.2% of revenue versus 21.5% last year, a decline of a 189 million or a 130 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was 1.5 billion or 19.9% of revenue versus 21.3% last year a decline of a 147 million or a 140 basis points. This rate decline was primarily driven by the realization of our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management throughout the company. International non-GAAP SG&A was 290 million or 22.1% of revenue versus 22.3% last year, a decline of 42 million or 20 basis points. This rate decline was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost reductions and tighter expense management in Canada and to a lesser extent China. Merchandize inventories increased a 146 million or 2.7% to 5.6 billion primarily due to deliberate investments in high demand back to school computing inventory and inventory to support our over 800 Samsung and Sony Home Theater stores within a store. As we enter the back-half we expect this increased level of inventory to continue in order to support our ultra-high definition TV and Pacific Kitchen & Home expansions as well as our initiatives to reduce retail out of stocks. In our consumer surveys one of the top reasons customers say that they do not buy when they are in a Best Buy store is that the product they are looking for is not in stock in that store at that time. Now looking forward to the back half, as Hubert remarked earlier, industry wide sales are continuing to decline in many of the consumer electronics categories in which we compete. We\u2019re also seeing ongoing softness in the mobile phone category ahead of highly anticipated new product launches. Therefore absent any changes in these declining industry trends and with limited visibility to new product launch quantities. We continue to expect comparable sales to decline in the low single digits in both the third and fourth quarter. From an operating income rate perspective in the back half we\u2019re expecting the following business drivers versus last year. One, a similar promotional competitive environment but with better promotional effectiveness internally. Two, a greater mix of online revenue that will put pressure on the overall operating income rate, three, continued industry softness and higher promotionality in Canada and China; and four, a net positive impact from our Renew Blue cost reductions as they will more than offset our investments in structural pricing, the new credit card agreement and the new incremental investments we\u2019re making in the back half of the year totaling 40 million to 50 million or $0.07 to $0.09 per diluted share to support the customer facing initiatives that Hubert referenced earlier. This 40 million to 50 million will breakdown by quarter as follows, 10 million to 15 million in Q3 and 30 million to 35 million in Q4. As a result of all of these business drivers and particularly in-light of the fixed cost deleverage that will accompany an expected low single digit comparable sales decline, we\u2019re expecting the non-GAAP operating income rate in Q3 and Q4 to increase in-line with the year-over-year improvement that we saw in the first half. Additionally in the back half the estimated diluted earnings per share impact of the discreet tax items that we discussed last quarter will continue to be in the ranges of flat to negative one in Q3, and negative $0.09 to $0.10 in Q4. With that I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions). We will take our first question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley : Just a couple of questions. First on the top line I think you called out TVs both in the printed release and in the script and then there should be product launches on the mobile side and those are two pretty important categories between TVs and mobiles. And so we appreciate the status quo view on the top line but shouldn't one look at I guess some of these trends and have a little bit more of a constructive outlook in the back half of the year? Hubert Joly : I think anyone can have their view on the future. I think we have shared ours this morning. We have a backdrop of a consumer environment that\u2019s a bit fragile. We see the trends, of course in our space you always have ups and you always have downs so the net effect is what you\u2019ve to look at. Specifically as it relates to TV while we\u2019re excited by the new technology and the customer response I think we all have to appreciate the fact that the actual impact this year will still be relatively limited before we ramp up into next year. So that\u2019s something take into consideration. Of course as it relates to mobile. The uncertainties around the quantities you get at this point in time and frankly we have little visibility, a limited visibility at this point in time. So I think you can develop the view that there is upside but we want to highlight that there is some factors that limits the potential top line in the back half of the year. But again Simeon, forecasting is difficult so we shared our view and we respect yours. Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley : And then my follow-up is regarding the intensifying of investments. Can you hash out whether that is how you are reacting to some to some opportunity that you see or is something changing that is unfavorable? Because I think the topline outlook or picture that we see doesn't seem so different from the way that it was laid out or forecast by you and so what is prompting the change? Hubert Joly : I think what\u2019s prompting change is from a strategic direction standpoint there is no chance. Meaning that our moves completely consistent with the roadmap that we have outlined over the last couple of years and certainly this year. I think the investments are a combination of us seeing the potential of some of the initiatives we\u2019re working on as well as the need to be in the game for some of these initiatives. So no dramatic change but increasing confidence and sense of reality around these opportunities. I don\u2019t whether Sharon McCollam you want to add any color to this but that\u2019s what I would say. Sharon McCollam : : Operator : And we will move on to our next question from David Schick with Stifel. David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus : Could you give us any sense of what these capabilities like ship from store to the customer at home or that inventory lookup that you talked about with associates in stores and we have certainly experienced that when we are in stores, the frustration in the past with the associate's ability to say yes right now. As you look at turning that on, how much do you think you gave up an opportunity over time and in particular last year's fourth quarter? Sharon McCollam : Sure. David, I\u2019ve to believe that it is an important number. First let\u2019s just ground ourselves on ship from store, that aspect of our business right now which was over half of our online growth this quarter. In the store what we\u2019re seeing with that number is we launched it late April and the stores are just now starting to use it. We\u2019re seeing the numbers increase each day and we\u2019re looking again in these customer facing initiatives I was talking about, we\u2019re looking at some opportunities there to make that even a more efficient process once they found the inventory and getting it to the customer faster. So I think that last year we didn\u2019t have it at all. Similar to ship from store, you\u2019re seeing you know what\u2019s doing for us obviously. In the store side of it, they did not have this capability and then in ship from store when you think about the back half of last year, if you recall in Q2 and Q3 we really only had 50 stores that were shipping, October last year we went to 400 stores shipping and then in January of \u201914 this year we went to -- our all 1400 stores. So in the back half we also expect the ship from store capability to benefit us in three ways. One of course is serving the customer where, when and how they wanted, they want that inventory and we have opened up that 2 billion of inventory to give to them. The second is the margin improvement that we\u2019re seeing because particularly on our clearance end of life inventories, it is creating a much more efficient clearing method because we have so many viewers online to supplement the retail traffic thus driving a better outcome on the markdowns.  Another benefit that we have seen from ship from store is that when we\u2019re allocating the inventory to all the stores we used to send a lot of that inventory back for reallocation when we\u2019re out of balance. We have significant, more than half of the inventory returned a year ago, we didn\u2019t have to return this year. Thus the cost and complexity that goes along with that. So those are what we\u2019re seeing now. The back half of course is a very different time of year and there is nothing in what I just shared with you that would say to us here that we\u2019re not going to see the types of benefits at a much higher rate occurring in the back half for us particularly again this is so big around Q4 when I\u2019ve to have it I need that gift, those kinds of demands from our customers and we will be shipping faster and that will be important. David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus : And as a follow-up, the original Renew Blue take on the business was -- or the outline was the long term 5% to 6% operating margin. Now there has been a lot of puts and takes to the industry and you guys have worked on initiatives, there has been incremental pressures, there is opportunities all over the last 18 months. But do you think all those things together still boil down to a 5% to 6% operating margin opportunity long term for the business? Sharon McCollam : Yes, I think that it's important though to recall that when we gave that we said we need very low single-digit but single digit positive comp sales. When you think about the revenue leverage that you see especially in quarters like Q4, on the fixed cost which I called out earlier in my business drivers for Q4, it's so significant and with our categories, these NPD categories tracking at this negative 2.5% rate I know it makes it hard to see but that 5 to 6 is predicated on that. What we\u2019re particularly pleased with right now well not excited about negative comps, don\u2019t get me wrong is that with the things that are within our control operationally and executionally we\u2019re continuing to improve in those areas. What that says is that when we get to that point, where we see the cycle comeback into CE that we\u2019re going to have the operational infrastructure and the cost structure that will highly leverage those sales and that\u2019s the part that we\u2019re greatly looking forward to and I know as investors you guys are too. But that\u2019s how we see getting to that number is going to be through some top line growth and then in addition to that continuing to make progress against these kinds of initiatives that we spoke of today. David Schick - Stifel Nicolaus : I guess we will have to see if anybody ever makes a new phone or anybody wants a nicer TV again in the future. Thanks. Hubert Joly : Thank you, David. Operator : And we will move on to our next question from Alan Rifkin with Barclays. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : So first question surrounds the Renew Blue program. You had targeted $1 billion in cuts but for the last few quarters the expense savings have been declining sequentially with only $40 million realized in this quarter. As you look further out over the next couple of years, do you think $1 billion in totality is still the number? And in breaking it down between SG&A and cost of goods, where do you see the greatest incremental savings going forward coming from? Sharon McCollam : Yes, in the spirit on the SG&A side of the Renew Blue cost reductions. We have obviously taken substantial cost out of the company and of course they have slowed I mean the 40 million is less than it was in the previous quarter. The place that as you know we have not included in that billion a large percentage is of the returns replacements and damages, we within the numbers we\u2019re reporting on our achievement of Renew Blue has an amount associated with returns, replacements and damages but it's actually very slow to-date. And off that as you recall let\u2019s just all get grounded. We said we\u2019re losing over -- approximately 450 million and we expect to lose a 100. So we see a 300 million to 350 million opportunity there. It's very structural and how we go after it, we\u2019re going in the fourth quarter you will start seeing a lot of that online inventory show up and then Hubert in his prepared remarks to help give you guys more visibility to some of the other things that are happening in the company because while showing the inventory online is very important and quite frankly getting those viewers and getting that population when the majority of this inventory is sold online anyway is critical but there are other operating things happening internally right now and plan is being put into place and changes in operating procedures happening that we think are going to accelerate that for us as we -- this would be a 2016 opportunity for us as well. So that\u2019s where I see it coming from Alan going forward. We will continue, however there are areas operationally in the company, I would speak to our services areas and some of our other what I would call tasking related activities in our stores and some of our replenishment processes where I think that there is higher efficiency to be garnered but again many of these requires structural system changes, so are slower in coming. Alan Rifkin - Barclays Capital : Okay. One more question if I may. Sharon, this is really the first time you have given definitive guidance on your comp outlook for the all-important fourth quarter and you are now saying it will be down low single digits. Where does this number really compare to where your plan was at the beginning of the year and what really has changed if anything in terms of your guidance on the comp for Q4 specifically? Sharon McCollam : Yes Alan, we certainly believed that early in the year that we would see less softness in those NPD categories. We also were more optimistic about the innovation in mobile and after last year having the Samsung Galaxy other things came out we don\u2019t want to go vendor by vendor, we had a few exciting things last year but the fact that the innovation in mobile has been pretty soft this year was different than we hoped. Now the good news is that we have remained very conservative and you know us. We don\u2019t live on our wishes and hopes here; we live on what the data says. So, based on the industry data around these categories it still does not paint a positive picture. If you look at the people who write about this industry even with a highly anticipated phone, not speaking to any one vendor but one of the highly anticipated phone launch. The saturation in the mobile phone category makes this complicated to forecast. We think it's exciting and we think the installment billing programs which by the way Hubert also called out. We\u2019re seeing an acceleration in that and it's very fast, the disruption of the carriers could be a dynamic that we did not anticipate. What\u2019s happening with the carrier plans right now what you\u2019re observing I\u2019m sure we did not anticipate. Now again until we see what that means we\u2019re not going to put that into a forecast. We\u2019re looking at economic data just like you, our consumer trending data and this is what it's showing. Now that is the same data I might add that told us to tell you last quarter that Q2 would be negative low single digit comps which is exactly where we ended up and we still in those NPD categories gained share. So that is what we\u2019re using Alan. So could it be better? Yes. Is the acceleration of Ultra-High Definition TV happening? There is no question about it. I saw an analyst report out this morning on the topic. So if that happens, you know when you read what I wrote this is predicated. What I explained and laid out is predicated on a low single-digit negative comp and the environment we\u2019re in now with only slight excitement and not any other offsets to this phone and UHD opportunity. Clearly I don\u2019t know if anyone is out there, that is better positioned than Best Buy with our new 800 Samsung and Sony Home Theater stores within the stores. I don\u2019t know how you could be better positioned to go after this new opportunity not to mention and I have to call this out is the blue shirts that are supporting that in our stores but knowledge of UHD in Best Buy, I\u2019ve to say we would put it up against anything in the industry right now and we\u2019re very product of that. So those are the possibilities Alan, that is not something I\u2019m telling you that the data does not support it and then there also you need to get -- you would also have to have an excessive amount of inventory as well. So we will see what happens but right now we see the data says that we could see similar NPD performance, track the categories performance. Operator : And we will take our next question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Thanks, good morning and we can feel just how hard you guys are working to achieve these results so appreciate you sharing the time with us. A couple of things. If you looked at the NPD categories that you referenced, can you give us a sense of what the e-commerce penetration is of those categories and maybe kind of how you compare against that? Also how the profitability shift to e-commerce is affecting the margins, SG&A, et cetera? I'm just not sure we have gotten any quantification around that. Hubert Joly : So e-commerce penetration in our categories is higher than in retail in general. We\u2019re one of the most highly penetrated sector from an e-commerce standpoint and it continues to shift, that\u2019s one of the things I said earlier. We\u2019re seeing continued and rapid shift in consumer behavior in researching and then buying online but if not buying online, studying the research process online before going to the stores which we do see is the for a given purchase, it reduces the number of trips to the store because you come to the store very well equipped and you completed. This is not new but this is continuing and very significant this has been the premise of the entire Renew Blue strategy and transformation. Now we\u2019re very encouraged by the growth of our online business, 22% this quarter. The reason why we\u2019re excited about this is that, as we said before, is to achieve the same kind of market share online as we\u2019re experiencing in the stores and we have much to do. So all of this is happening in a context where we\u2019re able to improve our operating income rate year-over-year which is something that we\u2019re very excited about. Now as it relates to your question pertaining to the profitability online versus the stores, I would first preface it by saying that trying to construct a meaningful P&L by channel is actually a fairly futile exercise because it is so inter-dependent. How should I count and allocate the marketing expenses? How should I count and allocate the investment that I make online for which a lot of the conversion is actually happening in the stores. So this is an exercise with limited practicality. This being said, in general online today the mix of products we sell, so let me say that profitability for given product is not materially different online versus in the stores. What we do see today is that from a mix standpoint not surprisingly the kinds of products that we tend to sell more online would be lower cube, lower touch, more commodity type products simple to buy, convenient and so forth. Whereas in the stores you\u2019re going to buy higher cube, higher touch products. You\u2019re going to have online -- still today despite our great progress lower attachments of accessories and services. And I don\u2019t think that this is necessarily something that we will continue. In fact we\u2019re determined to change that by helping customers buy the entire solution online and so down the road we would expect the profitability to the extent that we can calculate profitability to converge between the two channels but today as we shift more towards the online channel, this is having a slightly negative impact on the overall gross profit rates because of these lower attachments. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : Just a clarification and then a follow-up. Of your business which is 7.7% penetrated online, what is your guys best guess as to where the industry is on that same penetration? Hubert Joly : In the Renew Blue presentation back in November of 2012 we had tried to estimate that and from memory we had estimated that the market share or the penetration of online in our industry was in the high-teens and so clearly we have room to grow here. The mindset of the company as we see no reason why our online market share, or market share online should be lower than in the stores and we are determined to be agnostic from a channel standpoint and a profitability standpoint so as to be able to serve the customers the way they want to buy it. Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research : And if you can just help by telling us in your fourth-quarter guidance or your back-half guidance what you have contemplated for the promotional environment in Q4 specifically as you compare it against last year's kind of free for all? Sharon McCollam : In our prepared remarks or in my prepared remarks I said and was very clear, and this is for both Q3 and Q4 that we expected a similar promotional competitive environment. I left out irrational but okay, that was your adjective. But what we said is that we\u2019re going to have better promotional effectiveness internally. After Q4 last year you will recall Hubert made many comments about what we would be doing differently this year and has really done that each quarter and we have seen it work each quarter. So going into Q4, the rational disciplines that we have implemented and some of this additionally is also very operating procedure and systematic internal or systematic internally. We did not have the capabilities, pricing capabilities and promotional tracking capabilities a year ago that prepared us well for that kind of an environment. This year we have made investments in those areas. We have talked about those in previous calls and our teams are getting stronger obviously every quarter. So we anticipate our ability to do better but honestly we just believe that our competition will continue with similar behaviors to previous years. Operator : And we will move on to our next question from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : On that last question, I was curious it seemed like last year the sector business sort of softened late in the year and people were culling too much inventory in the channel and then panic ensued. Are you seeing a similar build up this year or do you think you will see a build-up this year of the same level of inventory throughout the sector going into the fourth quarter? Sharon McCollam : David you might be on the cell phone and we got a cut out on about every third or fourth word, could you just repeat your question for us please? David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Last year I recall it seemed like that the business for the sector softened late in the year and inventory levels were too high across the retail sector and there was panic afterwards. I\u2019m curious as you sort of think about this year being similar, are you seeing inventory levels growing at the same rate as they did last year? Hubert Joly : I think that\u2019s, we don\u2019t know of course the inventory levels of our competitors. What I would say is if you rewind to last year the market environment, the demand in our space in Q2 and Q3 as well as our own comps trended relatively positively in Q2 and Q3 I think we were -- in Q3 we were positive in the low-single digits and while we were probably getting market share, this was also represented of a more supportive business environment including in the very important mobile category and whereas this year to repeat when we look at the market in Q1 and Q2 including in mobile you\u2019ve a very different picture. Sharon talked about in mobile, everybody is talking and accepting new products in the back half but the penetration of smartphones in the country has really reached very high level. So how big of an impact is it going to have above and beyond the question of the availability of the inventory. So you\u2019ve I think a very different environment. Forecasting into Q4 is really hard; we\u2019re giving you our best shot. I think that after Q3 we all maybe able to get a better perspective. There will be more information but certainly the sentiment going into the back half of the year is very different from what it is today. Now we\u2019re not sitting here thinking and hoping that everybody there will be say, okay so we won't compete in consumer electronics we\u2019re not counting on that. What we\u2019re highlight is that we ourselves are approaching holiday this year with a different set of tools than last year. Sharon talked about the better enhanced effectiveness around promotions and of course we have a whole list of things that we have been working on during the year that I mentioned including our gifting strategy and wish list which are being deployed. The better in store experience with the additional stores within the stores and expert labor in particular around Ultra-High definition TV but also appliances and what not. The more targeted marketing communication, the ship from store of course which will be in all of the stores was not in other stores last year. It was deployed in all other stores in January. And then the increased effectiveness as a result of the organizational changes was made in the stores. So as you can see we\u2019re very focused on what we can control in executing everything in our control and then we will take the environment as it is. David Magee - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Just a quick follow-up. Some people think that back-to-school is a harbinger of what is to come with holiday sales. Are you seeing anything with back-to-school that gives you reason for hope or cautiousness? Hubert Joly : I would say that back-to-school so far is in-line with our expectations. There is potentially I think in retail in general, a more positive environment but we\u2019re not just going to take a couple or three weeks as a source of excitement. This is an economy in general in a sector where there is lot of volatility week to week and month to month depending on this, this and that. So but yes in general there is a sense that the retail environment in the last few weeks have been better and certainly the beginning of the quarter has been in-line with our expectations. Sharon McCollam : And David I will just add we\u2019re very focused on the calendar at Best Buy and the things that go all around the calendar. One thing to consider which I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all considering. I have seen several reports, is that because of the weather last year many school districts are going back to school early and we are also very focused on how much of this is lift versus shift because of the timing of earlier back-to-school dates than a year ago to cover up for snow days. So that is just an add for you on some things that we\u2019re looking at internally just to make sure we don\u2019t get over -- get ahead of our lights in this. Operator : Thank you. And we will move along to our next question from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank : A couple of questions. First, on phones, you have talked a few times about not sure what the volumes you guys are going to get or the inventory. How has that played out in the past iPhone launches? Can you remind us what kind of allocations you have gotten and has it actually been a positive to your business when it launches or is it maybe perhaps can be a negative because people are going to go to the Apple stores because you guys won't have the allocations? Hubert Joly : Yes, I mean what I would say without getting into excessive details. We have a very good relationship with all of our key vendors in that space. I think we\u2019re mutually important to each other and we value their relationship. I think they value the channel. So in general that would be true in our business. Anytime there is significant innovation from a product standpoint that is far from being a negative if I can put it this way. So we look forward to the launch, I think our comments pertaining to the fact that every time in the initial weeks there is limited inventory and now I think we are being treated by our vendors very, very fairly. There is no doubt about this and I think in phones in the U.S. we have to keep in mind that while in the last five years you\u2019ve seen a rapid increase of the penetration of smartphone you will reach a point of penetration which is about 70% which is quite high and it's about 90% plus of the new phones that are being sold being smartphones but there is a point where there is a cap to the penetration of phone. So we\u2019re expecting a huge lift, is not something that we would contemplate. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank :  When did you expect that to launch by the way? Is that a third quarter or a fourth quarter event? Hubert Joly : I can give you a phone number in California to call for further details. Sharon McCollam : We have some more visibility to these things than you do. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank : Understood. One more question if I could on a different topic and just looking at the expenses that you referenced the November 2012 Analyst Day documented a few times. In that presentation I think at the time you had said that your North American corporate G&A was about $4.2 billion which I think was 10% of your North American sales at that time. Can you update us on where that number is 18 months later? Sharon McCollam : We have not been continuing to publish that number, we actually because of the investments we have made in the stores and other things, we feel that it's little more competitive than it used to be. So we have made a decision to not continue to report on segments of our G&A. Operator : And we will move along to our next question from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: My first question, you have mentioned the Ultra HD TV quite a bit and others have as well. As we look at that product category, what do you see -- maybe more from a qualitative standpoint, the consumer response right now? And are there certain things that need to change whether it be content and such to make Ultra HD maybe a bigger driver of better topline results at Best Buy? Hubert Joly : What\u2019s very exciting about Ultra-High Definition TV compared to 3D a few years ago is that the customer benefits is immediately tangible and meaningful in the form of improved image quality which of course is a huge driver of demand in particular when you get to these very large screens, the number of pixels become critically important and what\u2019s very positive today is that even without new content you\u2019ve the upscaling and so with the current content the customers see a material difference and when they go to our stores we can show them the difference between high-definition and ultra-high definition TV and I encourage everyone on the call as well as the rest of the country to pay a visit to one of our stores where you\u2019ve the Samsung and Sony customer experience. When you walk into the store you don\u2019t know that you need an Ultra-High Definition TV. After 10 minutes seeing the product and talking with Wesley [ph] blue shirt was hyper trained in Ultra-High Definition TV. You will know that you needed, the only question you will have is when and which one it will be. Now beyond that of course, there are various media companies that are working on 4k content. I think you can hear Netflix, you can hear Amazon, you can hear a variety of sources but again we don\u2019t need to wait for that to have that. The TV, Samsung and Sony also have storage devices that allow you to have access to. So what\u2019s going to drive the penetration is the price decline. Now prices have started to go down and probably for many of you on the phone it's going to be highly affordable this holiday but for the vast majority of the public they may want to wait until next year and the following year. There is price points that are significant from that standpoint. So, we think it's essentially a price discussion but the product itself is very ready and exciting. So which is why we said this morning we are excited by the potential but do realize that the impact this year will still be rather limited. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer: A second question is a follow-up if I may. I think someone else asked about back-to-school. In recognizing back-to-school period has shifted a little bit this year and it is obviously not nearly as big as the holiday season but the question I have is we talked about some of these better internal promotional effectiveness. Are you seeing -- is there a way to say that here in back-to-school we have seen these efforts on the part of Best Buy to drive better results and maybe that is a harbinger of how we should think about your promotional effectiveness come the holiday selling season? Sharon McCollam : Yes I think that obviously every day we\u2019re practicing better promotional effectiveness and when we look at our performance as it relates to all periods but back-to-school as well we have been using that rigor, that promotional rigor around all that that we\u2019re doing and obviously we\u2019re seeing outcome similar to outcomes that we saw in the second quarter. So yes, I believe that what you\u2019re seeing from us today as it relates to pricing and promotional rigor is going to be no different than what you see -- I actually believe in Q4 it will be better because you guys got to remember there were something\u2019s in Q4 last year that of course were above and beyond exceptional target breaches and other things which I don\u2019t even want to raise here. So I believe that all the disciplines we put in around and then those things that will not recur may put us in a very strong position thus the reason that in the prepared remarks today we talked about the fact that despite all of these things we\u2019re still expecting operating margin expansion in the back half equal to what we have seen in the first half of this year. So despite some of these negative things that we\u2019re talking about despite the fact that we\u2019re going to -- we have guided to you slightly negative single digit comps we\u2019re still saying we\u2019re going to expand our operating margin even though -- versus some of the first call estimates we could have 300 million or so less revenues. So it is that promotional effectiveness and of course then there is the G&A side of it as well that\u2019s driving that but we\u2019re expecting to see benefit in Q4 on both. Hubert Joly : Thank you Sharon and I think we\u2019re going to wrap this at this point and in closing obviously I want to thank our teams across the business for their outstanding commitment and hard work serving our customers every day and driving the transformation of our company and of course I would like to thank all of you on this call for your participation this morning and your ongoing support. So thank you and have a terrific day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 11 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien:  Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our President and CEO, and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. As usual, the media will be participating in this call in a listen-only mode. This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings release that we issued earlier today. They both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, and should be read in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release. Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the Company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company's current earnings release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to the consumer electronics industry trends. The consumer electronics industry, as defined by the NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging, and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our Domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Mollie, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I will begin today with an overview of our third quarter results and update you on the progress we are making against our Renew Blue priorities. I'll then provide thoughts on the upcoming holiday season and a discussion of our priorities beyond holiday before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. So first, our financial results. In the third quarter, our teams delivered positive comparable sales, improved profitability and continued progress in our Renew Blue transformation. This resulted in a $9.4 billion in revenue and $0.32 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share versus $0.18 last year. Operationally, this year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by a 0.6% revenue growth and the benefits from our Renew Blue and other SG&A cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by strategic pricing investments and the ongoing competitive pressure on our gross profit rate. On the top line, while sales in the NPD-reported Consumer Electronics categories declined 0.2%, our strength in televisions, computing, and tablets versus the industry, in addition to our growth in gaming and appliances, drove a Domestic comparable sales increase of 2.4%, excluding the 80 basis point estimated benefit associated with the classification of revenue for the new mobile carrier installment billing plans. Domestic online comparable sales increased 22%. Also during the quarter, we continued to make progress against our Renew Blue priorities. In merchandising, we continued to expand our appliance offering through the opening of 15 Pacific Kitchen and Home stores-within-a-store and are on track to end the year with 117 stores versus 67 last year. In home theater, we opened 10 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store and are on track to end the year with 50 stores versus 33 last year. We also continued to expand our ultra-high definition or 4K TV assortment. In mobile, despite major phone launches being quantity constrained, the adoption of installment billing plans continued to accelerate throughout the quarter. Within these plans, we saw higher average phone prices and higher attach rates of services and phone accessories. In phone accessories, we significantly expanded our exclusive assortment through new partnerships with fashion designers and growth in our own private label brands, which allowed us to offer our customers an industry leading phone case assortment in time for the new iPhone launch. In marketing, we continued to shift marketing dollars away from TV and print to digital media and display campaigns including a successful traffic-generating back-to-school initiative. We also continue to drive increasingly powerful customer communication through the leveraging of our new Athena database. While we remain in the early stages of being able to personalize marketing messages to individual customers, we're beginning to see better click-through rates on these new campaigns when compared to mass non-targeted e-mails. In our online business in the third quarter, we continued to leverage our ship-from-store, digital marketing and enhanced Web-site functionality to drive a 22% increase in Domestic comparable online sales. Similar to the first half of the year, ship-from-store represented over half of this growth. We also launched several customer-facing site improvements including significantly richer visual and editorial content for the home theater, mobile, appliance and gaming categories, expanded 'wish list' capabilities, and expanded in more inspirational holiday gift center, and an improved checkout process that provides faster and precise 'get it by' delivery dates on approximately 60% of Best Buy delivered SKUs rather than up to five to eight day range. In our retail stores during the quarter, we continued to improve the physical presence and shopping experience by expanding our fleet of appliance in home theater stores-within-a-store, increasing our investments in store refresh initiatives adding compelling vendor displays, increasing sales training and integrating new vendor-funded labor into our premium customer experiences. While traffic to our stores continue to decline year-over-year, the trends improved compared to the first half of the year. In services, we continued to increase our NPS or Net Promoter Score and drive down costs through operational efficiencies. We also launched a lost and theft mobile phone insurance program to supplement our historical Geek Squad Protection Plan. However, service revenue continued to decline, as Sharon will discuss in more detail later. In our supply chain, we continued to transform our distribution and fulfillment capabilities by operationalizing a faster and more precise delivery experience to our online customers and locking a significant percentage of our major appliance and large-screen TV inventory that was systematically trapped in a single market and not available to be purchased by customer outside of that market. In returns, replacements and damages, we launched a new section of the Web-site called Best Buy Outlet which expands the online visibility of open box inventory that can be purchased online and picked up in store. We also expanded the percentage of return products that we are Geek Squad certifying which while small is leading to higher margin recovery due to customer confidence in the quality statement that Geek Squad certification inspires. Our Net Promoter Score was flat year-over-year in the third quarter, which we believe was driven in part by the impact of product availability associated with the launch of new phones. This plateau follows a 400 basis point year-over-year improvement last year. And relating to our overall cost reduction initiatives, in the third quarter we eliminated an additional $65 million in annualized cost taking our total renewable cost reductions to $965 million, towards our target of $1 billion. Now as we enter the fourth quarter, we are excited about our holiday plan, which has been built around; number one, the cumulative progress we have made against our Renew Blue priorities; number two, an operational roadmap that incorporates the specific learnings that we gained from last year; and number three, our current views on the consumer and competitive environment. Within this plan, I would like to highlight the following growth, customer experience and profitability initiatives that we believe will drive better year-over-year outcomes. So number one is the customer-facing changes that we have made on our site and in our stores, including the merchandizing and labor upgrade I discussed earlier, that touch many of our key categories, especially home theater, accessories, appliances, emerging categories such as health and wearables and connected home, and digital imaging. Second, our ability this year to sell installment billing plans in the mobile phone category. Third, a more inspirational gifting strategy, including a greater assortment of products below $100. Fourth is a more defined and structured approach to our promotional strategy, including greater analytics around competitive response plans. Fifth, more relevant and targeted marketing investments, including a more concise statement of our value proposition, 'Expert Service Unbeatable Price'. And sixth, increased inventory availability due to the rollout of ship-from-store to 1,400 stores versus 400 stores last year, the regional unlock of large appliances and TVs and additional online exposure of certain open box inventory. Now, like every holiday though, of course we believe the outcome of these initiatives is and will continue to be tempered by external and internal factors, including the investments that are required to drive them. The external factors include; number one, an intensely promotional competitive environment; number two, a possible constraint in product availability in recent high-profile product launches; and number three, a potential supply chain disruption related to the West Coast port delays. The internal factors include; number one, the increased mix of faster growing but lower-margin products in our revenue; number two, the potential impact of higher incentive compensation, particularly in our retail stores, based on our expected year-over-year improvement in performance; number three, higher growth in our lower-margin online channel; and number four, intensified investments in customer-facing initiatives. We believe the net financial impact of these factors in the fourth quarter assuming near flat revenue and comparable sales growth will be a year-over-year improvement in our gross profit rate but flat year-over-year SG&A dollars, and Sharon will provide more color on this later in the call. Now before this, I would like to briefly share with you some thoughts about our priorities beyond holiday as we continue our Renew Blue transformation. So at this point in our transformation, we have eliminated close to $1 billion in cost, reduced our Domestic SG&A rate by approximately 170 basis points compared to two years ago, and made progress towards stabilizing our Domestic comparable sales. As we look to our environment, we see continued economic pressures including more rapidly declining average selling prices in key product categories in expectation of competitively matched prices, we see declining demand and increasing pricing pressures for extended warranties driven by improving product reliability and declining average selling prices for parent products, we see increasing customer service investments like free and faster shipping or expert service in our retail stores, and we see greater customer expectations around large cube supply-chain experiences. And with our more affluent demographic and complex product offerings, we are becoming more of a specialty retailer in this evolution and must offer our customer a high-touch experience. Now against this backdrop, at the beginning of this fiscal year we outlined a roadmap for the next couple of years of our transformation. We are pursuing a strategy that is focused on delivering advice, service and convenience at competitive prices, we're focused on driving a number of profitable growth initiatives around key product categories, life events and services. These initiatives include; number one, capitalizing on the ultra-high definition TV and gaming cycles; number two, increasing market share in growing categories with structural barriers to entry like large appliances, mobile and connected home; number three, establishing Best Buy as the destination for health and wearables; number four, further expanding branded, exclusive and private-label assortments; number five, continuing to expand our secondary market growth strategy to improve our margin recovery on returned, replaced and damaged products; number six, expanding our life events program such as 'wish list' and a gift registry; and number seven, evolving our service offerings to make them more relevant to today's customer needs. And in support of these initiatives, we are transforming major facets of the Company. We're applying more science behind our promotional and pricing strategies, we are accelerating targeted and personalized marketing programs, we are transforming desktop and mobile site customer experience, we are enhancing our in-store customer experience from both a service and physical environment perspective, and we are taking steps to drive increased sales effectiveness and payroll leverage. It is our expectation that delivering better advice, service and convenience at competitive prices and successfully executing our initiatives will help grow comparable sales and increase operating margins. It also requires investments. In light of our environment, we believe it is imperative that we move quickly and invest aggressively against these initiatives that we believe will allow us to continue to advance our growth and improve our financial performance. All of these initiatives would be part of our fiscal '16 operating plan and we are excited about both our short and long-term growth prospects. We're also confident in our ability to execute against these initiatives as we have demonstrated over the past two years. The external pressures however are driving structural industry changes, and to win we have to lead. To do that, incremental investment like those I have already discussed will be required and while these investments will put pressure on our operating income rate, we believe that they will also allow us to build a differentiated customer experience and drive our long-term success. We will more deeply discuss these external pressures, growth opportunities and investments in our fourth quarter earnings call after we have completed our fiscal '16 operating plans. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our third quarter financials and our fourth quarter outlook. Sharon McCollam : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus our expectations. As Hubert said, during the quarter we continued to make meaningful progress against our Renew Blue priorities which resulted in better than expected non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.32. This result versus our expectation was primarily driven by the sales declines in the NPD-reported Consumer Electronics categories being lower than previous quarters, higher than expected revenue in computing and tablets, higher mobile revenues due to better than expected results from new phone launches, better performance of our new credit card agreement, and greater pricing and promotional effectiveness, partially offset by increased investments in customer-facing initiatives. I'll now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.6% to $9.4 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.14 to $0.32, primarily driven by higher revenues and the flow-through of our Renew Blue and other cost reduction initiatives. We also saw a $0.02 per share benefit associated with the restitution from a legal claim. In addition, the lower tax rate this year drove an incremental $0.02 per share benefit due to favorable discrete tax events. These favorable impacts were partially offset however by ongoing competitive pressure on our gross profit rate. Domestic revenue of $8 billion increased 2.3% versus last year. This increase was driven by comparable sales growth of 3.2%, but excluding an 80 basis point estimated benefit associated with the classification of revenue for the new mobile carrier installment billing plans comparable sales increased 2.4%. This increase was partially offset by the timing of recovery on mobile phone trade-in liquidations, store closures, and $8 million or 15 basis points in less favorable economics of the new credit card agreement. Domestic online revenue was $601 million and comparable online sales increased 21.6% due to substantially improved inventory availability made possible by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store in January of 2014, a higher average order value, and increased traffic driven by greater investment in online marketing. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 110 basis points to 7.5% versus 6.4% last year. As we enter the fourth quarter in the online channel, we will be comping last year's gaming console introductions and our initial 400 ship-from-store rollout. Therefore, as the fourth quarter last year was the first quarter we benefited from these growth drivers, this year's fourth quarter will experience approximately 600 basis points of growth pressure that we did not have in the first three quarters of this year. From a merchandising perspective in the third quarter, comparable sales growth in computing, gaming, televisions, and appliances was partially offset by declines in other categories, including services, mobile excluding the impact of installment billing, and tablets. The services comparable sales decline of 10.3% was primarily driven by lower mobile repair revenue due to our success in decreasing claim severity and frequency, which is an operational positive, and lower attach rates. International revenue of $1.4 billion declined 8.4%. This decline was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, a comparable sales decline of 3% driven by China, and the loss of revenue from store closures in Canada and China. Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the third quarter was 22.7% versus 23.1% last year, a decline of 40 basis points. The Domestic non-gross profit rate declined 50 basis points to 23% versus 23.5% last year. This decline was primarily due to a lower gross profit rate in the mobile business, including ongoing declines in customer demand for standalone mobile broadband products, structural investments and price competitiveness particularly in accessories, increased revenue in the lower margin gaming category, a highly competitive promotional environment in tablets, and a 10 basis point negative impact related to the less favorable economics of the new credit card agreement. These declines were partially offset though by increased revenue in higher-margin large-screen televisions, the realization of our Renew Blue cost reduction and other supply-chain cost-containment initiatives, and the receipt of $11.5 million or 15 basis points in restitution from a legal claim related to an inventory dispute. The International gross profit rate was 20.7% versus 21.2% last year. This 50 basis point decline was primarily driven by our Canadian business due to a highly competitive promotional environment in tablets and higher revenue in the lower-margin gaming category. Now turning to SG&A, enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 20.5% of revenue versus 21.7% last year, a decline of $104 million or 120 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 20.3% of revenues versus 21.7% of revenue last year, a decline of $68 million or 140 basis points. This rate decline was primarily driven by the realization of our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management throughout the Company. These declines were partially offset by Renew Blue investments in online growth and other customer facing initiatives. International non-GAAP SG&A was $297 million or 21.4% of revenue versus 22% of revenue last year, a decline of $36 million or 60 basis points. This rate decline was primarily driven by Renew Blue cost reductions and tighter expense management in Canada and to a lesser extent in China. As it relates to the International segment, while we made considerable progress on our Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives, we have substantial work to do on top line stabilization. To address this, we are executing against the same Renew Blue transformation roadmap that we are pursuing in the U.S. From a balance sheet perspective, merchandise inventories decreased $78 million or 1.1% to $6.9 billion. Although we accelerated inventory purchases in anticipation of West Coast port delays, these incremental receipts were more than offset by better than expected revenues. But as we said last quarter, we do expect to end the year with higher inventory levels in the range of $150 million in order to support our ultra-high definition television, accessories and Pacific Kitchen and Home expansions, as well as our initiatives to reduce retail out-of-stocks. I'd now like to talk about the financial outlook for the fourth quarter. As Hubert outlined earlier, there are internal and external factors with both positive and negative implications that we believe will influence our enterprise financial results in the fourth quarter. Considering these factors, we are expecting the following impacts in the fourth quarter. Near flat year-over-year revenue and comparable sales growth, assuming revenue declines in the NPD-reported Consumer Electronics categories are in line with Q3; an improvement in the year-over-year gross profit rate; and flat year-over-year SG&A dollars due to higher incentive compensation and intensified investments in customer-facing initiatives. We will also recognize an incremental $20 million on the SG&A line due to a greater proportion of our vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than an offset to SG&A. The net result of all these impacts, similar to last quarter's outlook, is an approximate 50 basis point year-over-year expansion in the Q4 non-GAAP operating income rate. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, as we said before, the estimated diluted earnings per share impact of the discrete tax items that we discussed will continue to be in the range of a negative $0.09 to $0.10 in Q4. With that, I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Kate McShane with Citi. Kate McShane : Good morning and congratulations. I was wondering if you could walk through in a little bit more detail the impact of mobile in Q3. Obviously there was the big launch in September. But I wondered if you could walk through what some of the dynamics were with the launch and how you think this will maybe differ in Q4. Hubert Joly : So there are a couple of things I would highlight. Prior to this iconic launch, we saw continued pent-up demand. So the market dried up and had a significantly negative impact on our mobile revenue. Then at the launch we did quite well but then supply was uneven during the quarter. So that's a positive followed by a negative. We did see nice positives from our expanded accessories assortment. If you visited our store or the sites, I think you will have seen that. So that was a positive. Then you have the shift into installment billing. So if you remember last year, we didn't have installment billing. We started in the spring. It's now grown very significantly with the impact you've seen on our comps, that Sharon and I have split out. The benefit of installment billing is the increased attach rate on services and accessories as well as the mix into more expensive phones. This for the customer, it's great \u2013 installment billing is a great value proposition from a customer standpoint. Now we ourselves, we want to be agnostic, we want to sell whatever makes sense to the customers, it's a great value proposition for the customer and therefore they tend to buy a little bit more. So these are the various drivers. Now looking into Q4, a main uncertainty remains the availability of iconic phones, there's a number of them but we can think of at least one or two, and that's very difficult to focus. So we do expect to continue to be constrained during the quarter on that standpoint, which you will see however of course compared to last year is the fact that we now have installment billing which we didn't have last year. So I think in our prepared remarks we touched on that. So these are the factors I would highlight. I'm turning to Sharon to see whether I forgot anything notable. Sharon McCollam : No, Hubert, I think you've covered it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse. Gary Balter : First of all, congratulations to both of you on results to date and I'm sure further progress. The question I had was, last year \u2013 and you touched on it, Hubert and Sharon \u2013 last year between Black Friday and Christmas, you had trouble driving traffic to the stores, and I don't want you to give your competitive \u2013 given competitors are probably listening to this call, I don't want you to give competitive sensitive information, but could you describe if anything whatever you can share with us what your plans are between Black Friday and Christmas to create more excitement in the stores? Hubert Joly : So you are right to highlight that week two and week three of December last year were quite extraordinarily bad, candidly not just for us, this was industry-wide. If you remember, you had a bit of a perfect storm last year with a rapid shift to online and traffic to the malls and the stores that was quite extraordinary. I think last year we all agreed was, there were so many unique factors that it's going to be hard to replicate the kind of drama that we had last year. I think we have detailed on the call the overall elements of our plan for holiday, I'm not going to give you the play-by-play, day-by-day because I know our friends [indiscernible] who are on the phone wouldn't appreciate that too much or other places in the world, but I think that the plans we've built really combine three elements. One is the cumulative effect of everything we've been working on over the last year to improve the customer experience with our advice, service, convenience, as well as all of the lessons from that including one I would highlight is gifting, as well as in particular gifting below $100 and improved \u2013 I think our improved messaging as well, marketing messaging, more targeted. Last year if you remember it was a little bit too much of, buy in the next two days otherwise it's going to be too late, and then three days later we would tell you, buy in the next two days or it's going to\u2026 So I think we're going to be \u2013 our marketing messages, you may have noticed that, were a bit more balanced, more targeted and hopefully create some more excitement. But to be candid, we are also prepared from the standpoint of combining science and judgment in our promotional activities and so forth. I must say that last year during these last two weeks, many of us were perplexed and there was a bit of overreaction at that time last year. So the program combines that, Renew Blue transformation and then the lessons from last year, and then wish us some luck, okay. Operator : We'll move along to our next question, Dan Wewer from Raymond James. Dan Wewer : Hubert, I just wanted to follow up on your comments beyond the fourth quarter of this year and specifically if you continue to believe Best Buy has the potential to reach a 5% operating margin rate, and if so, how do you envision the amount of square footage changing going forward, either closing Best Buy mobility stores, reducing the size of big-box stores and perhaps closing big-box stores if those leases expire? Hubert Joly : So on the 5% to 6% operating income, we do believe that the structural industry changes we are seeing are going to put pressure on that range, but we also believe that these changes could drive opportunities for us as well. And so we'll continue to monitor both as we progress to the next phase of our transformation. As it relates to the store footprint, the way we think about this, and we've been very consistent in talking about ongoing thoughtful rationalization of our store footprint, I'll repeat something we said on the last call and maybe elaborate a little bit. We do see retailers shift to online. Customers are starting their shopping journey online. It's so convenient. Sometimes they are completing the shopping journey online. We like that. In our case, by the way, 40% of the revenue then gets picked up in the stores. And sometimes the transaction itself is completed in the stores. But the result of this is fewer trips to the store, right, either because you've completed the transaction online or because you've done so much research that you don't need as many trips to the store per purchase to complete the transaction. So what does it mean for the stores? It means that the trip to the stores need to be extraordinary from a customer experience standpoint for the transactions that are high-touch and large-cube, it needs to be an amazing customer experience, and it needs to be very efficient for in-store pickup or, I'm on a business trip, I forgot my phone charger and I need one quickly, and by the way the stores are still and probably forever will be the best solution if you want it now. Now is convenience. And so, our vision for the store footprint is related to this. Now the other factor we take into consideration is the fact that we have very few stores, and we've been very consistent in saying this, we have very few stores that are not cash flow positive. So we feel, we continue to feel that closing stores ahead of lease expiration is simply not helpful from a shareholder standpoint. And the other thing that everybody has to recognize, and we certainly do, is that when you close stores you don't retain all of the customers. So one of the things we are excited about is our ability to personalize and target our communication with customers, as it increases over time will be very helpful to be able to help the customers with the journey of ongoing floor space optimization. So we continue to see that as a gradual and thoughtful process. Now as we close stores, everything else being equal, we will even with increased personalization see some lost revenue and therefore you will see an increase in profitability with slightly less revenue everything else being equal, because of course we can also find other ways to grow the revenue. So these are our current thoughts on this continued transformation in the fourth quarter. Dan Wewer : Okay. And Sharon, one real quick question, you talked about a 15 basis point or $0.02 per share benefit from a tax settlement I think you said regarding inventory. Does that show up on the income statement on gross margin rate? Sharon McCollam : Yes. This was a legal settlement not a tax settlement. We have the tax issue and then the legal settlement. The legal settlement was around inventory, thus it's a reduction of cost of goods sold and it shows up in the gross profit. Operator : We'll move along to our next question from David Strasser with Janney Capital Markets. David Strasser : I guess a question, one of the things I notice more and more in the stores is the third-party salespeople and I'm trying to understand sort of the dynamic of that as far as whether or not \u2013 I've heard some people say, I'm pretty sure they're not your employees but they are employees of the vendors, I'm trying to understand that a little bit better, and as we go into the holiday season, how substantial you think that could be, is that helping on ASP, is that helping on close rates, at what times of the week these type of employees will be there? And I guess sort of a related question, that which could be construed as a follow-up would be, as I'm trying to look at the TV category, how much is ASP versus units in sort of the TV category strength that you saw in the third quarter? Hubert Joly : So let me be very clear about the sales staff in the stores. With a couple of exceptions that date back a while, the labor that we have for our various vendor experiences is Best Buy labor. We get something from the vendors and they may have on their search, in reference to a specific vendor, to indicate their expertise but they are Best Buy labor. And they spend, as you would expect and appreciate, a lot of time in the stores and we pay a lot of attention to continuing to provide customers knowledgeable and biased advise because we feel that this is very valuable to the customers and so a very strong part of our culture. This being said, we like the fact that we have put an emphasis on customer facing labor, even though we've reduced our SG&A materially. As you know, we've put emphasis on customer facing labor. We like the fact that we are getting help from our vendors from that standpoint and we love the impact on the customer experience and of course the ability to sell more and sell better. We briefly alluded incidentally in our prepared remarks on an opportunity that we have that we are quite excited about, which is efforts in our retail stores to improve sales effectiveness and increase our leverage from labor that over time we'll be able to talk to you all about. And so that's what I would say in general about store labor. Now, Sharon, do you want to answer the question about TV ASPs and units? Sharon McCollam : Absolutely. As you'd expect, Dave, we're seeing favorability in both. David Strasser : Is there one more dramatic than the other? Sharon McCollam : From a competitive point of view, we are not going to be disclosing a lot about the UHD cycle, but obviously you can see in the stores the pricing on the TVs, et cetera. So you're going to have an ASP benefit at the high end and then you're going to have \u2013 we're also as you know we play across the entire category. So a large piece of our TV business is not actually in UHD as well and we saw very strong television category this quarter, but we're going to be short on details from a competitive point of view as we go into holiday. David Strasser : I guess I have to accept that. Thank you. Sharon McCollam : Okay, sorry. Operator : And we'll move along to our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : As you look across the promotional landscape for the holidays and the deals that you're already able to see from others, what is your impression about the margin that your competition is willing to invest this year versus last year, and then how does that ebb and flow over the course of the period? Hubert Joly : I would answer the following way. In general we are in line with our expectation. The promotional environment is very intense. It is certainly not less intense. I'm not sure, if anything it's probably a little bit more intense than last year. I think that all of you follow the sector, so I don't need to point you to this or that player. Don't know of course how much money people are spending, I don't have access to their P&L, but the promotional season is off to a very vibrant start, I would put it this way. So as a result, in our outlook for the Q, we've not been betting on help from that standpoint. In fact we've been quite realistic. The one thing I would highlight in that context in terms of what we do about it, is again the combination of science and judgment on our own promotional activities and competitive reaction. Michael Lasser : Okay, that's helpful. And as a quick follow-up, can you give us a flavor for how well you are able to not only attach but also cross-sell that traffic that came into your stores in the third quarter for iPhones, and do you think you'll be able to sustain that type of performance into the fourth quarter? Hubert Joly : Thank you for highlighting that. These iconic launches generate significant traffic. We are happy with the accessories and services attached. Now is that impact related to the installment billing? I think we've said that, and in general what one of the things we've said in our prepared remarks is that the traffic trend to our retail stores was still negative has improved compared to the first half of the year. Now, what is the weight of these phone launches versus other factors, I would actually say that the mobile part of our stores is by far not the only place in the stores where we have transformed the experience. So I wouldn't exaggerate the impact from a traffic standpoint of these launches. Michael Lasser : Okay. Good luck with the holidays. Thank you so much. Operator : We'll move along to our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : So you've flipped to positive comps here, you're talking about sort of flat revenues in the fourth quarter, gross margin up, and all of these point to a building cash balance in the balance sheet, and I know it's been very important to see things like gross margin stabilize and sales stabilize, so how are you thinking about the cash as you get beyond the fourth quarter? Sharon McCollam : Chris, I'll take that. We of course have said consistently we're going to continue to maintain a very strong balance sheet. And once we get past the fourth quarter, of course the cash flows in the fourth quarter are significant, we understand that at that point there's going to be significant cash on the balance sheet and we will at that point start looking at alternatives. As you know, we continue to be deeply committed to our dividend. I know your question is really about, are you going to begin implementing share repurchase programs, and that is a discussion that we are not prepared and not wanting to have today, but when we go into next year rest assured that we know how important this is to our investors and we will continue to evaluate that. But the number one use of cash for us is investing in future growth right now. So where we can utilize that cash to drive these customer-facing initiatives, that will be our top priority, and then we will look to other vehicles for using the cash beyond that. Christopher Horvers : Understood. So as you \u2013 but I guess another way to think about it is, based on the up to date results, it would seem like you're going to have about $4 billion of cash in the balance sheet. Is there a level that your key vendor partners look to in saying, that's a cash value that is something that is a strong show of confidence and makes us feel really good about providing you great terms, as sort of a minimum cash balance level? Sharon McCollam : I think that we have an obligation to our vendors to maintain a strong balance sheet. When you look at the investment that our vendors have made in our stores in the last 12 months, 12 to 18 months, it is incredible, it is literally hundreds of millions of dollars that they have put into our stores to represent their customer experience. So we believe very strongly that our strong balance sheet has been one of the reasons why they have had great confidence in putting that kind of capital into their customer experience in our Best Buy stores. So you can never exactly square root what number is it that they are looking for on the balance sheet, but let's keep in mind that we are a 40-plus billion dollar retailer and we are heavily fourth quarter weighted. So I think that we need to be very \u2013 we're going to be very thoughtful about the intangibles as well as the tangible implications of any cash decision that we make. So I know that we've had this conversation and I so recognize and we recognize the importance of the discussion of uses of cash for our shareholders, I like the fact that you guys all understand how important it is to our vendors because I think we used this example in a couple of our meetings earlier this year, but when you think about it from a vendor point of view, right now some of our largest vendors are sitting with receivables from Best Buy unsecured, nobody wants their inventory back, and they may be lending you up to $2 billion at any point in time. So what looks like a lot to some, doesn't look like so much to another Board sitting across the country, right. So that's where we sit on that topic. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Thanks very much and good luck in the fourth quarter. Operator : We'll move along to our next question from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : My questions are focused on wireless. I guess as you look at all the significant changes in this marketplace focusing on installment billing and also the trade-in dynamic, which I know are present to many more transactions, how are these impacting the consumers' perception of affordability and the frequency of wireless purchases and also the basket that they seem to be looking for? Hubert Joly : I think we continue to believe in a number of things. One is the wireless space is obviously a large and very dynamic market. Of course there's a bit of saturation from a smartphone penetration, but there's also new usage. The phone, the mobile phone is really the center of people's lives since it's highly connected, if I can use that phrase, to other topics such as connected home and health and fitness. So it's an area of very intense interest on our part and of the overall industry. The installment billing development is a positive development from a customer standpoint because it provides much more flexibility to the customer. As you know, after one year you can actually upgrade. And so while the previous contractual arrangement of post-paid was a two-year contractual commitment, you now have the ability to upgrade after one year. The fact that it's a monthly billing also is an encouragement to facilitate we find attaching, from a customer standpoint buying services and accessories. And so these are positive development. You mentioned trade-in. Trade-in, in effect with the installment billing is embedded into the program, and so which was a phenomenon in the last couple of years is now structurally integrated in these new offerings. So all of this constitutes a set of positive development and it's an area where we continue to see opportunities for us above and beyond simply the phone functionalities as we represent in our stores a broad range of products that can get connected in the homes and the lives of the customers. Matt Fassler : And if I can just ask a brief follow-up, Sharon, you talked about the consumer electronics market expectation that drove your near flat comp assumption for the fourth quarter. What kind of wireless expectation is embedded into that [upside] [ph] of that CE number? Sharon McCollam : We're not guiding, Matt, by category but clearly when you think about \u2013 you know last year we had two issues in mobile. The first was that because of installment billing, the carriers stopped upgrades, early upgrades. Remember? In addition, we couldn't sell installment billing. So we had structural impediments in the fourth quarter of last year that we do not have this year. Therefore you could obviously expect that we would hope to see a significantly better mobile business in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. Hubert Joly : What I would add to this, Matthew, is that the flat revenue and comp indication we are providing this morning incorporate, includes the mobile phone business, it's not limited to the NPD categories. As you know, Q4 is in an intensively competitive area where a lot of retailers use CE to carry the excitement in our stores and so forth. So flat overall is the number we have shared this morning. Operator : We'll move along to our next question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Hubert Joly : And this may be the last question so that people can move on to their rest of the day. Peter Keith : Good morning and congratulations. I'll just keep it to one question. As a follow-up to the last comment around the Q4, comp guide for Q4, one of the things that looked impressive in Q3 was that your GAAP relative to the NPD data widened, and it looks like for Q4 your comps were to kind of tighten up again. I guess I'm just wondering, structurally is there anything going on with product sales that's going to cause that tightening that we should be aware of? Hubert Joly : I think one of the things I would highlight is the comment on discipline around promotional activities, and we are interested in comps but not [empty calories] [ph]. And so in some cases that \u2013 so in other words we don't want to be so addicted to the notion of positive comps that we would do unnatural thing from a promotional standpoint. So that may be what impacts our comments this morning on the outlook. And with that, I'd like to \u2013 or maybe, Sharon, you want to add something? Sharon McCollam : I'll just add, there's two more points. The first is that recall that last year that we had launched 400 stores that were shipping from store. So we created that inventory availability last year. Now this year we have the 1,400 stores shipping, but the 400 stores did, as you'll recall, drive increased revenue last year. The second point is, which I also mentioned in my prepared remarks, is that last year the new gaming consoles were launched and their deliveries were in the fourth quarter. We had the pre-order revenue in Q3 but the deliveries in Q4 and those were substantial. So as we look to the fourth quarter, we are expecting to see some potential differences in the strength of the hardware related to those consoles obviously. So those would be two other pressures, and remember that the gaming is not in those NPD categories that we discussed. So those are a couple of other points just to consider. We quantified that on the online growth last year at about 600 basis points of benefit last year, because remember we had over 25% growth in online last year. So I would not want you to put that in there when you're trying to do the math, that those two factors are necessary in order to get in line with the outcome that we put into the outlook. Hubert Joly : Thank you so much, Sharon. And in closing, I wanted to do a couple of things. One, obviously thank our teams in all functions and geographies for the progress, continued progress and results that we collectively, they collectively have delivered, and of course for their very exciting mobilization for holiday. It's always a very special moment of the year. Our teams are ready to welcome all of our customers, including all of you on the call, and I want to salute them for their preparedness. And of course I want to thank you and everyone on the call for your continued support and wish you a wonderful holiday season, which I know would include a few trips to Best Buy. You have at least two reasons to do that, one is check how prepared we are, and of course at the same time you can make progress on your holiday shopping adventure. So we'll see you in the stores or on our site at your convenience. So have a great holiday with your families and we'll continue to be with you on the journey. Thank you so much. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to Best Buy's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 11 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien : Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our President and CEO, and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. As usual, the media will be participating in this call in a listen-only mode. This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the two press releases that we issued earlier this morning including our Q4 earnings release and the second release announcing our plan to return capital to our shareholders. The Q4 earnings release and today's conference both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, and should be read in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release. As previously announced on December 04, 2014 the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its Five Star business in China. As a result of this agreement Five Star was classified as held-for-sale as of end of fiscal '15 and its results were included in discontinued operations for the current to prior year period. On February 13th Best Buy completed the sale of Five Star; we have recast certain financial information for fiscal 2014 and 2015 to reflect the results from the Five Star business as discontinued operations. This recast financial information is available in the exhibit 99.2 in the company's Q4 earnings release 8-K filed this morning and on our IR website investors.bestbuy.com.  Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the Company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company's current earnings release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to consumer electronics industry trends. The consumer electronics industry, as defined by the NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging, and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our Domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services.  I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our fourth quarter results and full year results and will then discussed the status of Renew Blue transformation and our priority for fiscal 2016. Before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary and our financial outlook. So first our financial results; In the fourth quarter our teams delivered positive comparable sales, improved profitability and continued progress in our Renew Blue transformation. This resulted in a 1.3% increase in revenue to $14.2 billion and a 23% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $1.48 versus $1.20 last year primarily driven by growth in our domestic segment. A compelling merchandise assortment and strong multi-channel execution drove these better-than-expected results as we capitalized on the product cycles in large screen televisions and mobile phones. These two categories were the primary drivers of our year-over-year revenue growth, and more than offset weakness in the tablet category which was impacted by material industry declines. Our value proposition of expert service and billable price resonating with customers whether they come to us in-store, online or both. We delivered to our customers a strong multi-channel experience and we were uniquely positioned to serve them to our national retail footprint, online experience, knowledgeable Blue shares and Geek Squad agents in our stores within a store. We also benefitted during the fourth quarter from our investments in inventory availability, mobile phone installment billing, and supply chain including faster store replenishment and online delivery, as well as more effective and relevant marketing. Altogether, these results reflect the successful delivery of our holiday plan. We said that we would execute a highly disciplined operating and promotional plan that would drive a better year-over-year financial outcome for our shareholders and these results reflect that. On a full year basis we continue to make progress against the two main problems we have to solve that we outlines in November of 2012; number one, declining accounts and number two, declining operating margins. In fiscal 2015, we stabilize comparable sales on a full year basis and delivered incremental non-GAAP SG&A reductions of approximately $420 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating income rate expansion of 80 basis points and 26% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $2.60. We also ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash versus $2.6 billion last year. These results reflect accumulative progress since 2012 that we have made against our Renew Blue transformation initiatives. So to-date we have number one improved our NPS score by 450 basis points; number two we\u2019ve rolled out 71 Pacific Kitchen and Home and 34 Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store, in addition to our enhanced vendor experiences. Number three, we\u2019ve implemented ship-from-store across the whole chain driving significant growth for our business; number four, we\u2019ve increased domestic online penetrations from 7% to 9.8% of our revenue; number five, we\u2019ve gain share across multiple categories; number six, we\u2019ve delivered $1.02 billion in Renew Blue cost reductions exceeding our $1 billion target; number seven, we\u2019ve divested underperforming European and Chinese businesses and number eight, we\u2019ve intensively managed our capital resources and significantly strengthen balance sheet. In light of this progress and as a demonstration of our commitment our shareholders, we were pleased to announce this morning our plan to return excess capital. This plan allows us to continue to invest in the growth of our business and preserves a strong balance sheet, it includes number one; special one-time dividend of $0.51 per share or approximately $180 million [related] to the net after tax proceeds from LCD-related legal settlement received in the last three fiscal years. Number two, a 21% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share and number three, the resumption of share repurchases with the intent to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over the next three years. So before I turn to our plan for this year, I want to publicly thank our employees for the impact of their hard work. We have a very talented and dedicated set of leaders and employees at Best Buy and it is an honor to lead this group of amazing individuals and a privilege to work with each and every one of them. Now as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is imperative that we continue to focus on driving comparable sales and improving operating margins while spending investments in our future. As we have previously shared, we are pursuing a strategy that is focus on delivering advice, service and convenience at competitive prices to our customers, within this strategy we\u2019re focused on driving a number of growth initiatives around key product categories, live events and services and to drive these initiatives we\u2019re pursuing and investing in the transformation of our key functions and processes. To provide more color on these initiatives which reflect complete execution against the 24 months road map that we were planning a year ago, I will now provide specific actions we intend to pursue in fiscal 2016. So the first initiative of our roadmap is merchandising, our goal is to create a compelling assortment online and in the stores with a superior end-to-end customer experience that yield enhanced financial returns. In pursuit of that, we plan number one; to capitalize on the ultra-high definition TV cycle to best-in-class merchandising assortment in customer experience including opening approximately 20 additional Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 with 78. Number two, we plan to accelerate our expansion in growing categories with structural barriers to entry like large appliances and mobile phone, including opening approximately 50 additional Pacific Kitchen and Home stores-within-a-store to end fiscal 2016 with 177, as well as extending our installment bidding spending capability online; number three, we plan to grow our connected home and health and wearable businesses to an optimized assortment and improved multi-channel customer experience; number four, we plan to increase our branded exclusive and private label assortment; number five, we plan to expand our secondary market growth strategy to offer consumers better access to these types of products and improve our margin recovery on returns we placed in damaged products and number six, we plan to acquire strides behind our promotional and pricing strategies. We will also, as part of this merchandizing trust expand our programs to capture customers at the time of key life events and build long-term relationships with them including our new mobile program and our wedding gift registry which we launched in February. The second initiative is marketing which provides of course crucial support for our merchandizing growth opportunities. In marketing we will accelerate our targeted marketing programs by leveraging a senior customer data base to expand personalization beyond email campaigns. We will expand the personalization of our targeted email campaigns by dynamic serving relevant landing pages when customers click through to our website. We will continue the evolution of our marketing spend from analog and mass to digital and personalized medium such as search, mobile devices and retargeting. And we will continue to increase the number of addressable emails in our customer data base. The next initiative on our road map is online, our goal here is to serve our customers based on how where and when they want to be served and capture online shares. In pursuit of that goal we will continue to develop true omni-channel experiences including; number one, improving the online visibility of returns open box inventory; number two, extending our installment bidding selling capability online; number three, enhancing the online experience for appliance purchases; number four, expanding capability for life events like the wedding registry and wish list. And number five providing an integrated Geek Squad customer experience across channels and devices and driving increased attach rates. We will also be continuing the transformation of our e-commerce technology platform and accelerating the transformation of our mobile customer expense which we will support for our new technology development center in Seattle. Similar to general industry trends our traffic for mobile phones is growing much faster than traditional desktop traffic and we're increasing our mobile investments accordingly. It is imperative that we engage mobile customers with improved and streamlined access to essential rich product information during the discovery, research and check out processes. The next initiative in our roadmap is retail stores. In our retail stores we're building on the great momentum from our success in fiscal 2015 and we'll be driving increased sales effectiveness and favorable leverage from focus on the individual sales productivity of our associates. We will be enhancing our in-store customer experience from both an expert service and physical environment perspective including expanding product training for associates, and we will be driving growth by implementing market plans that are tailored to specific geographies. The next initiative in our roadmap is services. In fiscal 2015 we significantly reduced legacy cost structure and improved services related NPS growth, we also lunched a lost and theft mobile phone insurance program and will complete technology support bundles. Now despite these accomplishments revenue has been declining largely due to lower attach rates of traditional extended warranties and lower mobile revenue due to our success in decreasing claims severity and frequency which is an operational positive. So in fiscal 2016, we'll be focused on continuing to transform our traditional service offerings to better address customer needs, we will be integrating the Geek Squad customer experience into bestbuy.com to provide an enhanced service experience to our customers and to increase online attach rates. We'll be continuing to improve our delivery and installation experience and we'll be increasing the investment in marketing and selling our service offerings. The next initiative in our roadmap is supply chain. Our goal in supply chain is to leverage our network and improve our customer experience with increased inventory availability improve speed to customer and improved home delivery and installation capability for a large [CUBE] Assortments. In pursuit of that goal we will unlock additional inventory for ship-from-store, we will continue to pursue cost efficiencies through technology enhancements including the replacement of our warehouse management system. We will drive growth in large appliances and large TVs by leveraging new regional inventory capabilities launched in October and we will invest in improving our home delivery and installation services NPS. The last initiative on our roadmap is our cost structure. So with the $55 million in additional annualized cost reductions announced today, in the past few years we have delivered over $1 billion in North American Renew Blue cost reductions. In fiscal 2016 we're launching Phase 2 of our Renew Blue cost reduction and gross profit optimization program with a target of approximately $400 million over three years including the remaining benefit of approximately $250 million from our previously discussed returns, replacements and damages opportunity. These savings because they are structural in nature are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016 and will be driven by streamline processes and operational efficiencies that will be primarily enabled to investments in systems. We expect however that this incremental savings would be significantly offset by the investment we need to make to fund our growth initiatives; in fiscal 2016 we expect these incremental investments to total approximately $100 million to $120 million, $0.17 to $0.21 in diluted EPS and [indiscernible] main bucket. One is the customer experience online and in our retail stores, two is information technology and three is marketing. We also expect to increase fiscal 2016\u2019s capital expenditures to approximately $650 million to $700 million from $550 million in fiscal 2015.  So the strategy we just outlined is the foundation for our fiscal 2016 operating plan. And we are confident in our ability to execute against this as we have demonstrated this past year. But we will also be facing industry and economic pressure that we discussed last quarter in our holiday sales press release that we expect to impact our business including more rapidly declining average spending prices in key product categories, weak industry demand in certain product categories, declining demands and in price pressures from our extended warranties and increasingly competitive and costly cost in the service expectations like free and faster shipping. So to win against this back drop investing now is imperative and while these investment will put pressure on our fiscal 2016 operating income rate as Sharon will discussed, we believe they\u2019ll leverage our exceptional momentum and will allow us to build a differentiated customer experience and the foundation for long term success. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our fourth quarter financials and our financial outlook for the first half of fiscal 2016. Sharon McCollam : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus our expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release. From a top line perspective enterprise comparable sales growth of 1.3% excluding the 70 basis points impact of installment billing was slightly above our near 1% expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate expansion of 130 basis points was also above our 75 to 90 basis points expectations due to higher than expected vendor participation in our holiday promotional activity, combined these better than expected outcome equated to an incremental $0.10 of EPS. We also saw a positive $0.03 per diluted share of a non-recurring tax benefit which partially offset the previously communicated negative $0.10 impact from the reorganization of our European legal entities. I'll now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year enterprise revenue increased 1.3% to 14.2 billion enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.28 to $1.48 primarily driven by a more structured and analytical approach to our promotional strategy better performance of our credit card agreement, the positive flow through our gross profit enhancement initiatives, the flow through of higher year over year revenue and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plan which resulted in lower cost due to lower claim frequency.  This favorable impact was partially offset however by the negative $0.07 per diluted share impact in income tax expense that I just discussed. In our domestic segment revenue increased 3.2% to 12.7 billion despite a 3.2% declining in the NPD-reported Consumer Electronics categories. Our revenue growth was driven by comparable sales growth of 2% excluding the estimated 80 basis points benefit associated with installment billing and a 68 million or 55 basis points improvement in the performance of our credit card agreement versus a negative 65 million or 50 basis points impact last year. Domestic online revenue on a comparable basis increased 9.7% to 1.7 billion primarily due to substantially improved inventory availability made possible by the chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store in January 2014. Higher conversion rates and increased traffic driven by greater investment in online marketing also contributed to our year over year growth. This growth, however, was substantially offset by material industry softness in tablets, a category with high online penetration, and a channel shift in mobile revenue that resulted from customer enthusiasm for installment billing plans which could only be sold in our retail stores.  As a percentage of total domestic revenue online revenue increased 90 basis points to $13.5% versus 12.6% last year; versus last year's online growth this year's online comparable sales growth of 9% was lower for two primary reasons, first, we saw the expected 600 basis points of pressure from lapping last year gaming console introductions and our initial 400 store ship-from-store rollout. We also saw approximately 500 basis points of unexpected additional pressure from tablets and mobile for the regions that I just discussed. As all of these pressures however, are expected to continue into Q1 and the impact of gaming and our chain-wide rollout of ship-from-store will increase from 600 basis points of pressure in Q4 to a 1000 basis points in Q1, online growth in Q1 is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range. From a merchandising perspective during the fourth quarter, comparable sales growth in Televisions, mobile phones and computing was significantly offset by the material decline in tablets. The growth in mobile phone was primarily driven by higher year-over-year selling prices. We also saw continued comparable sales declines in services in Q4. This decline of 11.4% was primarily driven by lower mobile repair revenue due to our success in decreasing claim frequency and lower attach rates. In our international segment, revenue did decline 12.4% to 1.5 billion due to a negative foreign currency impact of 750 basis points. A comparable sales decline of 4% due to industry declines in Canada and the loss of revenue from store closures in Canada. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in mobile phones was more than offset by declines in tablets, gaming and digital imaging. Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rates for the fourth quarter was 21.3% versus 20.2% last year, an increase of a 110 basis points. The domestic gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 21.2% versus 20% last year. This increase was primarily due to the more structured and analytical approach to our promotional strategy. The on-going improvements in supply chain efficiencies and higher margin recovery on returned, replace and damage products, a 40 basis points positive impact related to our credit card agreement as compared to a negative 40 basis point impact in Q4 of last year and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans which resulted in lower cost due to lower claim frequency. These increases were partially offset by structural investment and price competitiveness particularly in accessory. The international gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 21.7%. Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was 2.2 billion or 15.5% of revenue versus 15.7% last year, an increase of 9 million in dollars but a reduction of 20 basis points in rates. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was 1.9 billion of 15.3% of revenue versus 15.5% last year, an increase of 41 million. This dollar increase was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation and Renew Blue investment in customer phasing initiatives. These increases were partially offset by the realization of Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and tighter expense management throughout the company. The 20 basis point rate improvement was driven by year-over-year sales leverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was 262 million or 17.3% of revenue versus 17% of revenue last year, a decline in dollars of 32 million. This dollar increase was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign currency, lower expenses due to store closures in Canada and the realization of our Renew Blue cost reductions in Canada. The 30 basis point rate increase was driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. Also as it relates to the international segment, we completed the sale of our Five Star business in China and continue to focus on the Renew Blue transformation in Canada. I would now like to talk about fiscal \u201916, in fiscal \u201916, we expect a financial impact of the investments of economic pressures that Hubert discussed earlier to begin in Q1 and continue throughout the year. From a top-line perspective, our current expectation is consistent with the outlook we provided in our holiday sales release. While we are optimistic about the potential of new product launches, our limited visibility due to timing and quantity keep us cautious. As such, our Q1 and Q2 expectation for enterprise revenue and comparable sales growth excluding the estimated impact of installment building continues to be in the range of flat to negative low single-digit. This change in trend versus Q4 is primarily driven by ongoing material declines in the tablet category, in addition to holiday momentum around high profile gift able products not continuing post-holiday. We will also be [anniversarying] approximately 80 basis points of enterprise growth in the first-half of last year driven by the chain wide rollout of ship-from-store. From a non-GAAP operating income rate perspective, we are also reiterating our outlook for Q1 and Q2 as down approximately 30 basis points to 50 basis points, including lapping last year\u2019s Q1 15 basis point one-time benefit associated with the new credit card agreement. This decline reflects the economic and growth pressures that we just outlined, the investments we are making to drive our fiscal 2016 growth initiatives and our anticipated SG&A inflations. Additionally, we expect the Q1 and Q2 non-GAAP continuing operations effected income tax rate to be in the range of 39% to 40%. But despite these first half pressures we are in encouraged by the execution and momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter and are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for next year. While we remain cautious on the overall industry the strength of the Best Buy brands and our track record of improving our operational performance provide us with a strong confidence in our ability to deliver against the roadmap that we outlined today. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Sharon could you give us a little more detail on the guidance, the 30 bps to 50 bps of margin pressure in the first half, how that breaks down between gross margin and SG&A? And then also what's taking CapEx up this year, what that's been spent on? Sharon McCollam : Greg we expect the decline primarily to come from the SG&A line. We're making these investments as we've discussed last quarter and we expect those to begin in the first quarter -- we've actually already begun and those will continue obviously throughout this year. We will continue to be working on the disciplined approach that we're taking to our promotional strategies and continuing to also work on our Renew Blue cost reductions as it relates to the gross profit. But predominantly our pressures in 2016 are clearly coming from the SG&A line. As we talk about the incremental investments that we're making, baring capability, competitively we're going to be more cautious this year about talking about specifically where we're putting them but when you think about the things that you Hubert outlined in quite a bit of detail we're investing in our categories where we see big barriers to entry such as appliances and in the mobile business. We're investing in our supply chain, we're investing behind our roll out of life events and gift registry, remember those are initiatives that will have an extended tail as far as revenue goes. So we're going to invest in the marketing and the capabilities upfront and then the revenues to flow at a later date. So again you end up with early on investments. Well also as we talked about making some major investments in systems, we talked about a new warehouse management system. Of course we have our ongoing investments in online, Hubert talk about the integration of Geek Squad into our business as well as some of the initiatives we have around our services businesses which will also require from both capital and expense investments in 2016. So those would be major buckets under which we will be investing, I will add one more which I know you all have seen the benefit of, Hubert talked about the adding of the packed sales and the Magnolia design stores within our stores. These have been very successful for us; we expect to continue to do that. The other thing you saw last year and certainly you saw us do it and you saw the customer response to it through the comp that went along with it. With the investments that we've made in our stores either the vendor investment in the physical presence of our stores or what we have done there, we're finding that there are ways for us to significantly enhance the customer experience through investment in the transformation of the footprint within the four walls of our stores. And we expect to continue to invest in that this year as well because like -- we're really very much seeing the customer react and respond to what we have done there. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Binder with Jefferies. Dan Binder : My questions were around the payback on these investments, this investment spending that you're doing. Maybe if you can give us a little bit of color on how you think about that payback in the back half of this year and into next? Sharon McCollam : Dan this is Sharon, I'll take that. The payback on these investments is going to be back loaded the initial payback on some of these investments will happen in the back half of the year. The difference between the investments we've been making the last two years of Renew Blue and the investments that we're making now. These are much more structural and they will actually come incrementally. As an example some of the work that we're doing in the supply chain, we will roll out a portion this year, a portion next year and a portion after that. Returns replacements and damages is another one. We will create the capability online this year, then there are things that we will add to the system that we\u2019ll implement going into Q4 and that will go into next year and year after. So when we looked it\u2019s at 400 million that Hubert laid out we were very deliberate in how we talked about that because those are the areas where we are going to see improvement and cost reduction and margin enhancement. But they are going to be very gradual and incremental as they flow through. So that is how we see it and obviously we're not going be guiding it by quarter by year but basically over the next three years we expect to see these both not only driving the cost line but also driving the top line. Most of our investments right now and the once that I think are going be most substantial are actually going to be investments that are to drive top line growth. And so you're going see it both on the top line and coming through the operating income rate. Dan Binder : And if I could just a follow on the management change or departure today. Can you just give us a little color on what you're looking for in the next executive that will head up services, maybe a profile of what you're looking for and how you think you can counter the negative trends in that business? Hubert Joly : This is Hubert and thank you for your comment. Of course we won't comment on the departing individual, but before I answer your asked question, let me say a couple of things about services. Number one, I'm very proud of the work that our 20,000 Geek Squad agents do every day in our stores online or when they go into clients\u2019 homes to help install or support some of the toys that we sell to our customers. Number two, I'm very proud of the progress that we've made with our net promoter score in services in some of the new offers we introduced. Now clearly we also have a lot of work to do to continue to transformation I\u2019ve laid out, a number of priorities around the transformation of our traditional services offering developing the Geek Squad experience, online and in a multi-channel fashion improving delivery installation and increasing the investments in marketing and selling our services and more boldly speaking supporting our growth in integrated fashion as we go to market with a customer experience that leverages our unique capabilities which of course includes the Geek Squad. So just in case anyone of you would like to apply for the job let me answer your question now around the profile we're looking for somebody -- almost a CEO for that business. This is a real business within our business, somebody who combines strong operational performance as well as a strong strategic and growth oriented approach somebody who is good with cost and customers, somebody who is good with technology and online as well as high touched experiences. And somebody who is going to help us improve what we have which is a great set of asset; but take you to the next levels. So of course we are launching -- we\u2019ve launched an external search. In the meantime services will report directly to me, we will have great help from several of my collages, but the fact that services will report directly to me is of course an indication of the strategic importance we see for services today and in our future strategy. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : First on the top line I guess if my math is right that the contribution to the comp or the top line from TV is somewhere in the mid-single digits. We realize that tablets are weak but laptops are helping, but I think you also appliances that are healthy. So I'm just trying to get a little more color on bridging the gap from where that contribution is coming from TV to how we get back to flat to negative low singles. Is it more slippage in healthy categories or do you see some of the declining categories getting a little weaker? Sharon McCollam : We see the tablet decline was the substantial and we need to make sure that it's in perspective. In Q4 we saw the tablet category down 30% approximately the NPD reported category down 30% and at any point in time Best Buy is going have a 20% plus share of that category. So it has a significant impact on our top line, has a lesser impact on our profitability's. As you know it's not one of our most profitable categories but certainly it drives a lot of traffic to our stores. The other contributors from Q3 or Q4 to Q1 is what we called out which was the 80 basis points of growth that was driven last year by the 1400 store roll out of ship-from-store 80 basis points is substantial. And so that is another pressure because remember last year in Q4 we only rolled out all of the stores starting in January. So we only had 400 store shipping in the first two months of the fourth quarter and then we had 1400 shipping in fourth quarter. So the year over year comp for Q1 is much, much more difficult than it was in Q4. Another area and we're not going into extensive detail on, it highly competitive, is also the discussion we had in the Q3 conference call around a more disciplined promotional strategy, Hubert cleverly defined it as following the rat into the rat hole so to speak around the Back Friday holiday sort of timeframe. But there are other times during the year when you see similar behaviors and so there is a very rationalized approach and we\u2019ll continue to execute that, I am sure that you can see it flowing through in the gross profit rate. So that\u2019s another area, but certainly less impactful than the other two that I just described. Simeon Gutman : And then one follow-up on the capital return, and congratulations for reaching -- getting back to the buyback. We could all do the math on sort of what the dollars are going to look like, $1 billion, you said 180 million from the special div, and I think the increased dividend itself is relatively minor. You will probably walk before you run on this capital return, but I mean there is still a lot of cash on the balance sheet. It looks like you're going to generate a lot of cash next year. I mean sitting from here it looks like there is still a lot of upside to that capital return plan. I mean is that fair, Sharon? And then how soon could you unlock some of that upside? Sharon McCollam : Sure, Simeon we continue to believe that having an extremely strong balance sheet is important to the transformation; we also believe that maintaining on our balance sheet flexibility in order to pursue possible growth strategy is important too. However, we do also -- as I told you guys we would, we do also believe there is a point where you're carrying too much cash, thus the reason for our return on capital plan. So, we feel that this is our first step as we go into our third year of the transformation as we talked about we have some additional investments to make this year and as we get through this year and we see how we progress of course this will be a conversation we have each year. We obviously are committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders, I think -- I hope at least that today\u2019s announcement demonstrates that and we continue to believe that our approach is prudent at this point. So more to come, coming into next year, we got a year to deliver, let's just keep in mind we got a whole year to deliver here, but obviously today\u2019s announcement shows our first step. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker : So a couple of questions. One, can you talk about your store footprint? Do you have any store closures expected of the big boxes? And maybe looking at some of the stores you have closed over the last couple of years, anything you can talk about in terms of transfer rates or EBIT benefit from closing a store? Thanks. Hubert Joly : Consistently in the last few years we\u2019ve said that we would gradually and continuously optimize our store footprint and every quarter you can see the numbers both in our mobile stores and in our big box stores, these are minor numbers at this point in time, we\u2019ve been very clear that we would not make big announcement because our priority has been in fact -- the biggest leverage for us has been to improve the performance of our stores through investments in the customer experience, the multi-channel approach and so forth. So it's been a good approach. In terms of retention, one of the things we\u2019re very excited about is our investments in our Athena customer database and our more personalized communications as we develop these -- continue to develop these capabilities, we\u2019ve made progress last year, we\u2019ve made more progress this year. This will be very important strategic weapon for us as we move forward, as we can talk to the individual customer. Closing stores when you don\u2019t have this capability is a waste of a lot of resource. So, I think we\u2019re seeing the continuation of what we\u2019ve been saying and what we\u2019ve been doing. Mike Baker : Okay, thanks, helpful. If I could ask one more just to Sharon or maybe both of you, I think your operating profit dollars on a non-GAAP basis enterprise-wide for the full year, I think I calculated up 29%, it's a big number. Is that what you expected heading into the year? And I guess the question is what came in better than expected? Is it really all three of the big line items of sales, gross profit and SG&A or was it one more than another that really beat your plan? Thanks. Sharon McCollam : Yes, so versus our original expectations for this year if you just go back to the beginning of the year as we\u2019ve been giving you an outlook each quarter. The place where the year really exceeded our expectation was on the gross profit line. In the first-half of the year, we had the tremendous SG&A savings, but then in the back half we made some investments. So while the SG&A was certainly a highlight and year-over-year certainly a huge driver of our year-over-year improvement, the place where we really made more progress than we expected was in our gross profit. Two drivers of that, one is the investments that we\u2019ve made, one came from some of the SG&A we invested of course which was in this pricing and promotional capability and some of the decisions that we made around that. The other thing in Q4 that we would attribute our success to was a highly disciplined marketing plan to back up the merchandising, clearly if the merchandise assortment was very strong in Q4 and then that was of course supported by the marketing which was extremely targeted, focused and affected. We told you guys, that the year prior that this was an area we had to work on, there was great emphasis put in that area. But in the end the other place where we saw an exceptional outcome was merchandising, inventory, there was a lot of drama in Q4, [put aside] various things. One of the core competencies at Best Buy is inventory management. And obviously our positioning from a merchandising point of view with the vendors also contributed, there were some great products and Best Buy had the great products. So it was a combination of a lot of things but when you look at the P&L and you want to put it down on a piece of paper, it was really the top line and the gross profit improvements that we've been able to drive. Operator : We'll go to our next question from David Magee with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. David Magee : My first question has to do with just the commentary around making services more attractive to consumers, and I think probably that plays into a better warranty attachment rate in the future for the company. Could you just give a little more color about how that -- how you sort of see that playing out? Hubert Joly : Services has really to say two major components. One is the extended warranties which is more an insurance business or an assurance business and two, services that help customers take advantage of -- implements these toys that we sell them. We see enormous opportunities there. When you step back, the technology that's available today is more complex mixture than it's ever been and there is a growing gap between what these technologies, these products can do and the understanding of customers about the possibilities also it's increasingly connected, think about it 15 years ago and that's a long time ago. In our homes we had a personal computer, maybe connected to a printer and a fax line with dial up service and then we had a CRT TV, some audio equipment. Now everything is connected, we have multiple networks in your house and its complex and it's complex to implement, it's complex to support, its complex to take advantage of. So we see enormous opportunities to help customers in this area as part of our strategy to grow in the various categories we've talked about and we're uniquely positioned there. Because there is only so much you can -- I mean there is a lot we can do remotely and today we can troubleshoot your computer remotely using online tools. But there is a limit to this. And we have this gift which is we have 20,000 people, Geek Squad agents of the company and including those who get into people's homes and to support and set up a network and everything that goes around this, that's a very unique capability. So I think that's going to be a core theme, so there is going to be work on making sure that the extended warranty and products specific services are highly competitive and are effectively marketed and promoted and sold. And then there is building, you can say this professional services offering instead of capabilities to help our customers. David Magee : And as a quick follow up, the company's ability to sell return merchandise online after the holiday. Does that help narrow the profitability gap between online and retail? Is that meaningful? Hubert Joly : Why it\u2019s an ingesting shift, right, because when these return products or this could be also end-of-life products, the margin on these products is actually lower by definition. And so if you sell them online as oppose to in the stores, it has an impact on the margin of the online activities which by the way means that in many ways the online channel and the store channel both from a revenue and a profit standpoint, increasingly become blurred. And so our focused first and foremost on improving as a whole, we pay attention to each of these channels but they are increasingly blurred from a customer experience and then at P&L standpoint. Operator : We'll take our last question from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joe Feldman : Why don't you just give a little more color around the returns and damages and that opportunity there and the impact maybe that you have in the quarter, are you seeing an uptick in that? And I know it's been a focus but feels like there are defiantly ways that you can emphasize and improve that. Sharon McCollam : Yes, if you take a look at the -- go back to the transcript and what we said. We did see benefit this year virtually in every quarter and in Q4 was our biggest quarter obviously, where we saw incremental return from that initiative at this point we said and within that 400 million over the next three years there is about 250 left out of returns, replacements and damages. So that\u2019s kind of an indication because that was potential impact of about $350 million. We have made substantial progress in this area and we\u2019ve made about as much progress as we can make without measure structural changes to our system and our capabilities of being able to show that product in the online channel. So that\u2019s the structural investments that we're making this year in order to take that initiative to the next level. So you are seeing -- your recollection of things we\u2019ve said is absolutely correct and we expect to see more going into 2016. As you know we did bring up that product on the website it's harder to find then we would like it to be. Because of the way our impact and inventory systems comes together. So we're having to make do a lot of work there in order to make it easily searchable on this site and we believe that will be the next evolution of our benefits that we'll see from that initiatives. Joe Feldman : And if could follow up with a -- you guys mention that from this more scientific promotional approach this holiday season, just was hoping to get a little more color on that. I recall last year you guys kind of went deeper then you had wanted to on promotions. But anything like were you leveraging the system? How was the approach different from year over year? Hubert Joly : Yes Joe would say a couple of things, pricing and promotion of course is a science where tools and science and experience are really important. And last year we invested in teams and tools and capabilities that allowed us to have better information also I think that our team probably would use more wisdom as well -- it's a combination right to illustrate the point. In some cases you may have a particular competitor that has a certain product with limited quantities and a price set up to or promotion set up to drive traffic to their outlet. In some cases it may make sense for us to match, in other case it may not make sense to match when we have much bigger quantities and they have very limited capabilities. So I would say the way we manage competitive reaction this year with the help of this additional science which is very helpful. So was very proud of our team there and its combined with a very strong assortment and marketing also give us more confidence to execute. Retail is really about execution and giving the ability of our teams to execute in an orderly fashion where I think a very important point of our holiday. So I hope these comments are helpful. Joe Feldman : That was very helpful. Thank you guys and good luck with this quarter. Hubert Joly : Thank you so much and in closing, earlier on the call I thanked our teams at Best Buy for delivering these great results and in closing I'd like to of course thank our shareholders for your support and the confidence you are placing in us. I hope that this morning we did good job of conveying our excitement about our Q4 results and about our opportunities and we look forward to continuing the dialogue and again thank you so very much for your confidence and your support. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.",

Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy's First Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 :00 a.m. Eastern Time today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien - Director- Investor Relations : Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our President and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning. Today's release and conference call both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release. Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial conditions, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. In today's earnings release and conference call, we refer to consumer electronics industry trends. The consumer electronics industry, as defined by the NPD Group includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets not including Kindle, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our domestic revenue. It did not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services. During the quarter, as announced on March 28, the company consolidated the Future Shop and Best Buy brands in Canada under the Best Buy brand. The consolidation is expected to have a material impact on all of our Canadian retail stores and website on a year-over-year basis. As such, all Canadian revenue has been removed from the comparable sale space and international no longer has a comparable metric. Therefore, Enterprise comparable sales will be equal to domestic comparable sales until international revenue is again comparable on a year-over-year basis. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mollie, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our first quarter results and I will then provide highlights of the progress we've made in our fiscal 2016 priorities and then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. So first, our financial results. Enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion, in addition to our non-GAAP operating income rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS, all exceeded our expectations during the quarter due to a stronger-than-expected performance in the domestic business. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.6% was flat to last year, including approximately 35 basis points of increased costs to support our investments in future growth initiatives, and our non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.37 was up 6%. In the domestic business, against a backdrop where the NPD-reported consumer electronics categories, which represent approximately 65% of our revenue, were down 5.3%, our comparable sales in contracts, excluding the impact of installment billing, declined only 0.7% as we continued to take advantage of strong product cycles in large screen televisions and iconic mobile phones and continued growth in the major appliance category. Offsetting these positive trends was continued industry softness in other categories, most notably in tablets and computing where we have significant market share. For NPD, the tablet category declined nearly 30% similar to last quarter and computing declined high single digits versus low single digits last quarter. Throughout the quarter, our strategy of delivering Advice, Service and Convenience at Competitive Prices continued to resonate with our customers. While merchandising, marketing and operational execution were the tactical drivers of our better-than-expected first quarter financial results, strategically, we believe the cumulative impact of the progress we have made to improve our multi-channel customer experience is what has allowed us to consistently outperform the market. We have made real progress and it is showing in our results. I therefore want to thank our teams across all functions for delivering this progress and these results. All of us know that we have significant opportunities and work ahead of us. Thus, we continue to invest in the first quarter in the fiscal 2016 growth initiatives that we outlined in March. While these investments did and will continue to put pressure on our operating income rate, we believe they are imperative to driving future growth and improving our customer experience at every touch points. Today, we interact with customers in three distinct and complementary channels : online, in-store and in-home. We believe our ability to do this particularly in-home is a strategic competitive advantage that with these investments will further differentiate Best Buy from the competition and allow us to deliver uniquely personalized experience to our customers where, when and how they want to be served. As we invest, we will keep the obsessive focus on the customer experience that forms the core of our strategy. We operate in a retail world where good service is expected, therefore, we have to continue to identify and eliminate customer pain points as quickly as possible and in parallel, continue to focus on building uniquely engaging customer experiences which will be the basis for stronger long-term customer loyalty. I will now provide highlights of the progress we have made against our fiscal 2016 priorities, including our growth initiatives around key product categories, life events and services. So first from a merchandising standpoint, in appliances we rolled out 11 of the 60 additional specific kitchen and home stores within the store plan for this year. We also continue to invest in our fixed infrastructure to support the scaling of our appliance business as industry competition continues to provide opportunities to gain share. While these are multi-year investments, we do expect to see gradual and incremental improvements over time. In fact, in the first quarter, we saw early progress in improving our Net Promoter Score in appliance delivery and installation. In mobile phones, we extended our mobile phone installment billing selling capability online with AT&T and plan to roll out other carriers this summer. At this time, we are the only non-carrier retailer who can offer these types of plans both online and in-store and we believe this is a critical capability as consumer demand for installment billing continues to accelerate. We also continue to build out our key life events program. Of course, it is still very early for our newly launched wedding and gift registry, but we continue to see our new mover program drive significant revenue growth, particularly in televisions. We also launched an improved version of our multichannel gift center to deliver a better customer experience by significantly expanding the curated products to include more price points and more occasions. This was accomplished by supporting both Canada-based events like holidays, as well as using our Athena customer database to capitalize on other key events, such as birthdays and anniversaries. I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. With such a significant and fast-growing portion of traffic now coming from mobile devices, it is imperative that we accelerate the transformation of our mobile customer experience. And so I'm pleased to say that in the first quarter we launched a new mobile app. The new app, which includes the acceptance of Apple Pay, has received strong customer reviews. During the quarter, we also launched new search capabilities that include the online visibility of returned open-box inventory. While there are more capabilities being implemented this year to improve recovery of our returned, replaced and damaged inventory, to-date we've made it much easier for customers to find, view and shop open-box products by adding the relevant information and links to the product listing pages and search results. Lastly, we began recruiting for our new technology development center in Seattle, which we believe will be instrumental in continuing the transformation of our e-commerce technology platform and mobile customer experience. Turning to services. We envision services playing three important roles. Number one, to be a differentiator by offering a unique service as part of the product purchase. Number two, to be a business driver contributing to product sales and a stronger customer relationship. And, three, to be a profit center in its own right. We view services as a source of strategic competitive advantage based on our ability to provide these services online, in store and in the customers' homes through our own system designers and Geek Squad agents. We are encouraged by the early progress we have been making. For example, we are seeing strong and improving NPS scores across our service portfolio. We're also getting a positive customer response from our in-home consultations and services provided by our Magnolia Design Centers and the classes we began offering in some of our stores. We also know that we are in the midst of a multi-year transformation of our services activities that entails significant work around our service offerings, capabilities, processes, tools and systems across all customer touch points. Of course, as we look forward to fiscal 2016 and beyond, it is imperative that we continue to focus on reducing costs and driving operational efficiencies to fund investments in our future. Therefore, as we announced last quarter, we're continuing to aggressively pursue the benefits from the second phase of our Renew Blue cost reduction and gross profit optimization program and encouraged by our early work. As a reminder, our Phase II target is approximately $400 million over the next three years, including the remaining benefit of approximately $250 million from our previously discussed returns, replacements and damages opportunities. These savings are not expected to begin until the back half of fiscal 2016 due to their structural nature and the time that it will take to develop systems to capture the opportunities. These savings will be partially offset, however, by the incremental investments we're making in our future growth initiatives, which for this year we expect to be in the range of $100 million to $120 million or $0.17 to $0.21 in diluted EPS. In the first quarter, we invested approximately $30 million or $0.05 of diluted EPS to fund these initiatives. Turning to our international business. We're aiming to strengthen our long-term position in Canada as the leading provider of consumer electronics products, services and solutions by consolidating our Future Shop brand into the Best Buy brand. This plan includes permanently closing 66 Future Shop locations, which we did in March, and converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations and Future Shop website to the Best Buy brand. With these store closures, the company now has a total of 192 locations across Canada, including 136 large-format stores and 56 Best Buy Mobile stores. This plan also includes building a leading multi=channel customer experience which replicates successful aspects of our domestic Renew Blue strategy, including launching major appliances in all stores, working with our vendor partners to bring their products to life in a more compelling way, increasing our staffing levels to better serve our customers and investing in the online shopping experience, including expanding our in-store pickup areas, launching ship from store and introducing the marketplace program. To deliver this leading multichannel experience, as we've previously discussed, we're projecting to invest up to $160 million in capital over the next two years. So in summary, while the consumer electronics industry is subject to product cycles, we are excited about the role that technology plays in people's lives and the opportunities that this creates. We are also confident that we're executing against the right investment strategy that will allow us to capitalize on key technology waves and customer experience opportunities to build sustainable long-term shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our first quarter financials and our financial outlook. Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Our enterprise revenue of $8.6 billion exceeded our expectations due to stronger than expected growth in our domestic business. Our non-GAAP operating income rate also exceeded our expectations by 30 basis points to 50 basis points due to a mix shift to higher margin computing hardware and a better than expected performance of our credit card portfolio, again in our domestic business. I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue decreased 0.9% to $8.6 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.02 to $0.37, driven primarily by lower net interest expense and a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate due to a discrete income tax benefit in the quarter. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 1.4% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by an estimated 130 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and a $40 million or 50 basis point improvement in the performance of our credit card portfolio, partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 0.7% excluding installment billing. Our domestic comparable online revenue increased 5.3% primarily due to increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue also increased 30 basis points to 8.5% versus 8.2% last year. Versus last year's growth rate of 29.2%, this year's online growth rate of 5.3% was primarily due to the expected 1,000 basis points of pressure from lapping last year's gaming console introductions and the chain-wide rollout of ship from store as well as the industry softness in tablets and computing which represent a large percentage of our online revenue. We do expect the online growth rate to continue to be lower than last year's growth rate into Q2 due to again lapping over 1,000 basis points of growth from ship to store in Q2 last year. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in televisions, mobile phones and major appliances was more than offset by declines in tablets and computing. We also saw a comparable sales decline in services. This decline of 10.3% was primarily driven, though, by the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower claim frequency, an operational positive, and lower extended warranty attach rates. In our international segment, revenue declined 22.1% to $668 million due to a negative foreign currency impact of 1,000 basis points, the loss of revenue from one month of the Canadian brand consolidation and the ongoing softness in the Canadian consumer electronics industry. Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate for the first quarter was 22.9% versus 22.8% last year, an increase of 10 basis points. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 20 basis points to 22.9% versus 22.7% last year. This increase is primarily due to a 40 basis point benefit from our credit card portfolio, a positive mix shift to higher margin computing hardware, and additional positive mix shift due to significantly decreased revenue in the lower margin tablet category and the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency. These increases were partially offset by increasing inventory reserves on non-iconic phone inventory due to declining inventory valuations and a negative mix shift into certain lower margin iconic phones. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 100 basis points to 22.8% versus 23.8% last year. This decline was primarily due to the disruptive impact from the Canadian brand consolidation and increased promotional activity in Canada. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue versus 20.2% last year, a dollar decrease of $5 million but a rate increase of 10 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion or 19.8% of revenue versus 19.6% last year, an increase of $35 million or 20 basis points primarily driven by approximately 35 basis points of increased costs to support our investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by the realization of last year's annualized Renew Blue cost reduction initiatives and a discrete benefit from an operating tax settlement. International non-GAAP SG&A was $179 million or 26.8% of revenue versus 25.5% of revenue last year, a decrease of $40 million. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. From a rate perspective, the 130 basis point rate increase is driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. For the balance of the year, as we announced in March, we are continuing to project a non-GAAP diluted EPS impact from the Canadian brand consolidation in the range of negative $0.10 to negative $0.20 due to lost revenue from the closed stores, disruption to the rebranded stores and higher SG&A due to the short-term investments we are making to maximize customer retention from the closed stores. This non-GAAP diluted EPS impact which was minimal in the first quarter due to just one month of disruption is expected to be fully incurred in fiscal 2016. The top-line negative impact from the store closing net of customer retention rates, however, is expected to continue long-term. Ultimately, we expect the Canadian business to be more vibrant and more profitable with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. I would now like to talk about our financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. This outlook is based on the following assumptions. Number one, in the domestic business, a flat-to-positive low single digit revenue growth rate; two, higher year-over-year non-GAAP domestic SG&A dollars due to increased investments in future growth initiatives and SG&A inflation; three, in international, a revenue decline of 30% to 35% due to store closures and overall disruption from the Canadian brand consolidation in addition to the ongoing negative impact of foreign exchange rates; and four, an international non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 3.5% to negative 5%, reflecting the near-term impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation that we've already discussed. With these assumptions, our enterprise outlook for second quarter includes a flat-to-negative low single digit revenue growth rate and a year-over-year non-GAAP operating income rate decline in the range of negative 30 basis points to negative 50 basis points, which is in line with our previous outlook. This revised outlook however now assumes a strengthening in our domestic business versus the previous outlook, offset by the near-term impact of the Canadian brand consolidation. Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP continuing operations effective income tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 40%. While underlying this outlook is a cautious view on the NPD consumer electronic categories overall, we are encouraged by the strong product cycle in large-screen high-definition television where we have a high market share and our momentum in the growing categories like mobile phones and appliances where we have a relatively low market share. So with these opportunities and our track record in outperforming the NPD categories, we are confident in our ability to execute against the outlook we provided today. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : We'll have our first question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey. Thanks so much for taking the question. Two quick ones, hopefully easy. Anything that you can help us with to give us a line of sight into the holiday season this year on how you think that might shape up? And then I had a follow-up. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Aram. As you know, we're not talking about holiday today. It's still \u2013 it's too early to provide any color commentary. I think we've made some positive comments about some of the categories that are driving our growth in the large-screen televisions, phones and appliances. That pertains to the next quarter and going forward but it's premature to talk about holiday at this point. I wish I could tell you more. Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC : Okay. And the second thing is you're operating in an industry that's shrunk by 3% in Q4 and shrunk by 5% in Q1. Can you just talk broadly about things that might be on the horizon to help you? Because you're doing a great job of gaining share but it makes your life a lot easier if that was not a negative? And then also are there any other big opportunities in margin or SG&A that you work on and develop that haven't yet been announced that could be in case that industry trend continue ad infinitum? Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so let's \u2013 we need to be very clear. The 5.3% decline we called out pertains to the NPD tracked categories which are our most traditional product categories. They represent about 65% of our revenue. So you have other product categories that are not included in there, in particular, phones and appliances as well as gaming and entertainment. As you would know, phones and appliances are growing categories. Now, there's not immediately available precise information on these categories but I think if you look around you would assume that phones and appliances in particular are growing nicely. So I would not conclude even though we don't have precise facts for the quarter, I would not conclude that the industry as a whole is down by that much. Okay? So that's the first. It's really important to understand from an investment thesis standpoint because the industry is not down 5%. Okay? Now, it's hard to track exactly the number but it's not down 5%. Now, talking about categories we are excited about into the future. I think we've been consistent in saying, in fact, in particular that phones and appliances where a key area of focus for us, these are large markets that are growing, they -where our market share is low, so that's a significant area of focus that we talked about. And you're very familiar with some of the investments we are making. We've called them out on the call. The area of connected home is also an area of intense focus from a strategic standpoint. And it's not just the lighting or the locks; it's the fact that all of our homes are connected today compared to, you remember a few years ago, you had a PC, you had a CRT TV and a nice stereo system. Now, everything is connected which provides opportunities for us. There's a gap between what customers understand they can do with technology and what technology can do. So we are there to close these gaps. So we think about these waves of technology and I've given you two or three that are areas of intensive interest. As it relates to efficiencies, I think our entire strategy since day one of Renew Blue has been a balanced view between cost and revenue between the customers and the efficiencies, which is why we have the second phase of Renew Blue cost take-out that we've quantified at $400 million. As a management team, we're as intensively focused on that second phase as we were on the first phase. It's different in nature though. So it's more related to eliminating waste, driving efficiencies in our processes. So it goes after more structural systems-driven improvements, which is why we've indicated that start seeing the results in the next few quarters as opposed to in the first half of the year. But we're not betting on the market to all of a sudden becoming a rising sea to go after these efficiencies. This is a dual-track strategy. Aram H. Rubinson - Wolfe Research LLC : Thank you for that. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Brian. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. First off, a question on TVs. You called out the TV categories, one of, so to say, the bright spots in sales. How would you describe right now the overall momentum in that business from a product cycle standpoint and then relative to what the products may be coming out as we get closer to the holiday season? Thanks. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thank you. It's evidently an important driver of our quarter. Let me try to describe what you would see if you were looking at NPD data. The market is actually not up in the quarter. It had been up in Q4. It's not up in Q1. However, you have something that is going on which is a genuine customer interest for larger screen televisions. And, in particular, as the quality of the pictures has improved, and partly it is driven by 4K, a large-screen television is actually very appealing given a set number of pixels. And so what you're seeing is this wave in the large-screen television. What you are also seeing for us, and let me emphasize this because it's something we control, the work that our team, our merchandising team, has done in the stores in particular to showcase the latest TVs is quite extraordinary. As you know, we've done that in partnership with some of our key vendors in the stores, so Sony and Samsung in particular, with a pretty dramatic exposition of the TVs, as well as investment in expert labor. So there's more and more knowledgeable labor. So for these new TVs, I'm going to be judge and jury, but I'm going to say we're the destination for this and the better customer experience is really driving what is a material market share gain for us. Now, looking ahead at holiday, I think the one piece of uncertainty is going to be what the average selling prices are going to do in the back half as it relates to these TVs. So there's no doubt that the customer interest will continue. But the average selling price, of course, in our industry has a big impact on our top line. And how much deflation we will get, I think it's anybody's \u2013 it's a bet at this point in time. These are some of the key mechanics of what we are seeing. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): That's helpful. Then maybe as a follow up on that. If you look at that dynamic right now with some of this new technology coming through the TV side, is ASP right now a positive? Or what's helping the business more on the unit side? Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: What's going on is that there is significant price deflation. And I think if you visit our stores regularly, you'll be amazed by some of the prices we are offering. So all of you on the call, I encourage you to come and visit. What is helpful on the flipside is the mix. As we are mixing into a higher weight of large-screen TVs, the average selling price given the mix is actually helpful, but the individual prices are going down. I hope I was clear in describing that. Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker): Got it. Thank you. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli, RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey, guys. How are you? Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning. I guess this is a little bit of a follow up on Brian's question. I mean, if you look at Best Buy's history, you guys have always significantly over-indexed with new technologies. You did mention having a higher market share in the new technology TVs. Can you give us an idea or some sort of range on what your rough share is? And specifically, how would you expect that share to change as the category starts to mature, especially as prices start to come down, as you just referenced, Hubert? Because obviously we're in a bit of a different competitive environment than what we were the last time we saw a major product innovation outside of the Apple ecosystem. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so this is a highly competitive arena. There's intense competition around this category. So I am going to refrain from giving too much information to our friends around the other players. We do see and as we've highlighted this morning, a material share gain for us, so that's very clear. I've also told you that we are indeed doing better, as you've highlighted, with the large-screen new television 4K. as is the case. So over time, we fully expect that this market share may go down as the new technology becomes more mass market. When that will happen, I think it's hard to call with precision. But we would expect that the benefit of what we've done will continue as I think we've really created a material difference in the customer experience as relates to buying these TVs. And it's still early in the cycle of adoption of these large-screen TVs and 4K TVs. So we don't expect a reversal in the short-term, but over time it will happen, always does, and then we focus on the next big thing. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So maybe a little bit of a different question then. So as you wind up seeing the ASPs on the new technology come down, because you mentioned significant price deflation, can you give us a general description, at least in terms of what you're seeing on the margin on that product? Thanks. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, so your question is, does ASP deflation, does it have an impact on our gross profits? Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Correct. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Again, the answer is absolutely, yes, because it is a game of percentages and dollars. Even if the percentages stay the same when the ASP goes down, the dollar gross profit rate goes down. So welcome to our world. It's a world where we need to race constantly to beat these trends. And I think that what we're seeing in this quarter is the demonstration of our ability to do a very strong job taking advantage of the opportunities in the market. But it's hard work. Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : Our expectations \u2013 the expectation for the entire industry going into the back half of this year and going into next year would be that you would see increased volume because of the lowering ASPs, which then makes them more approachable to the mass. And then that would be true probably across the industry. So you end up with increased revenue and a slightly lower gross profit rate. That would be how we would see that playing out. And I'll just add to that that another place where we are in our minds clearly being able to inspire the customer and be able to put ourselves in a better position, of course, is from the promise that we can make to the customer on advice, service and convenience. Hubert talked a lot about it in his prepared remarks. And we clearly recognize that when somebody's in a Best Buy store and they are looking to invest in this type of technology, which is complex technology that we have a service offering that is not available across the landscape of retail and it makes a significant difference when you are changing technologies like this. So those combined is one of the reasons why we believe that it's a competitive advantage for us to be able to offer this more encompassing experience for the customer. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Lasser, UBS. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Two, actually. In recognizing that there's not a lot of visibility in the sales outlook for the second half of the year, can you discuss some of the puts and takes on the margin side and some of the discrete factors that we should expect to see as you move into the third quarter and fourth quarter? Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : Michael, yes. We didn't guide the third quarter and fourth quarter at this point because we're still looking for clarity, obviously, around the top-line. I just described what we expect around the industry for television going into the back half. We are extremely focused in the back half of the year on executing against the Renew Blue initiatives that we had laid out earlier in the Q4 release and then of course the efforts that we have been putting towards our waste efficiency and other types of optimization, margin optimization initiatives. So we'll give you guys more color. We are very confident as we look toward the back half of the year in what we can execute at Best Buy. We are making a lot of progress on the system side. You guys are giving us the latitude of being able to make these investments in our future growth initiatives. And as a result of that, we have taken that and run with it. You can see what we have been doing. We actually told you guys we would allow you to track that. We gave you real numbers this quarter around how much we invested in the first quarter in order to be able to drive the type of outcome you would all be looking for in the back half of the year and that, we, ourselves are looking for. So we are \u2013 as we go into Q4, everything we are doing right now is to be able to execute another very strong fourth quarter and again the cycles are very \u2013 I think are going to be helpful to us. While we don't like where NPD is, we don't sit around internally talking about NPD being down X percent. Our field teams are obsessed with the ability to continue to drive our outcomes that are in our control, not allowing the industry to dictate it and if you saw the momentum that we're seeing right now in the fields, we haven't talked a lot about ISP, our individual sales tracking, and the work that we're doing against that. So we have a lot going on right now that we believe is all setting us up to really execute well in Q4. We can't tell you what the industry is going to look like, we can't tell you what exactly what products are going to be the big sellers but what we can tell you is that with the investments we're making and what is happening right now, I call it magic in our stores. We are prepared to execute a really strong Q4. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Understood. And a quick follow up on the television category. We heard from many others that inventory was scarce of advanced televisions because of the West Coast port strike in the first quarter presumably given your strong inventory position you're going to be ahead of others to get products. So do you think that you were in better in stock position with that product during the quarter and that helped you gain some market share? Or was that really not part of the story? Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : I'm going to applaud our inventory demand planning teams and our supply chain teams here because the port strike seems to be coming up in a lot of announcements. We made a decision as we talked to you guys about in Q3 of last year that we were going to stay ahead of this. We did bring in more inventory, we did work with our vendors and partner with them, it was a small price to pay to be able to serve our customers. Being in stock is critical in our goals around our NPS. So we don't have a port strike story to tell you. Do we wish we had more? Yes. Do we have some pluses and minuses? Of course. But overall, the execution from those teams has been very strong. So we are applauding them and recognizing it's difficult. But at this point, we feel that we're in a good place, always like to have more but we're in a good place. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Understood. Good luck with the rest of the year. Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : Thank you. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Michael. Operator : We'll go next to Matthew Fassler, Goldman Sachs. Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Matt. Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I'd like to focus on two details from the P&L in the quarter. First of all, if you could give us some context for the credit card line item. How often do you true this up? Is this a thing you look at once a year? With more frequency, if the performance remains good, could we get another item like this? So how do we think about the cadence of credit card impact in the P&L? Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : So, remember, associated with the credit card that year-over-year last year we were down almost, I believe, it was 45 basis points year-over-year. So what we did this year \u2013 that was the transition period of the credit card. So this year we are obviously coming into a place where we are much more stable in the projections around the credit card and all transition for the most part is gone. We are benefiting in the credit card portfolio right now by a very strong backdrop which I would call the economy which of course gets around your loss ratios and other things in the credit card. Not to mention the fact that we're executing well at retail and building our portfolio. So it is a combination of two things. But the place, Matt, where we will be cautious \u2013 it's not cautious, it is a macro situation that we have to recognize is that the economy is tracking along. At any point there can be moments in the economy, both positive and negative, but the negative ones are going to probably impact your loss ratios. We tend to operate at a very high credit score. So it's going to be less impactful to us initially but that is the nature of these co-brands and private label credit card portfolios. So at this point, we felt like Q1 was a very strong quarter. We're maybe getting a little bit of residual off of the previous agreement which could potentially not continue. But as far as drama goes around the credit card at this point, we don't have any to talk about. Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And if it's possible to make the distinction, would you say that this favorable item was simply cycling the hit from a year ago? Or was it actually better than expected performance relative to the run rate? Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : I think it's both. Matthew Jeremy Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then a second question on the gross margin side, it relates to the reserves that you took for phone inventory. It's interesting that you had a lot of positives on the margin side. You spoke about the phone write-downs. If you could give us some dimensionalizing of that. And I don't think you spoke at great length about price investment, so does that remain a part of the margin story for you? Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : Yes. We did continue to make price investment in the first quarter. Because remember last year, we were investing each quarter measuring and then continuing. So it accumulates and then of course it comes \u2013 whatever we did in Q3 and Q4 of last year, it hits us in Q1. So absolutely invested in price. On the phone reserves, it's very simple. There are some very strong phones in the markets. And then there are other inventories that you may have whether they are new or open box. And these inventories, because of installment billings, a customer buying a used phone or a new phone or higher price phone, the monthly charge of that is quite small, the difference. So I can buy a more expensive phone without a lot of financial impact to myself through installment billing. So it takes the valuation on some of the less iconic phones and it impairs them. And I think that the great news is that we are so strong in the iconic ones that we saw this incredible performance of mobile. And the other side of that, (44:31) driven by that is this \u2013 what happens to the other phones when that occurs. So we do not see this as a long-term issue or something that's going to continue each quarter but it is associated with the other side of our performance, which was a very overall, including this reserve, strong performance in mobile. Operator : We'll go next to Peter Keith, Piper Jaffray. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): First off, just on the improved domestic revenue outlook, it looks like maybe came in towards the high end of your expectations for Q1, now expecting better results in Q2. Could you talk about what's driving that near-term whether it's products or store execution? Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, good morning, Peter. I think that Q2, it was \u2013 there's a few things we can highlight. First, from the phone standpoint, if you compare to last year, we have two iconic phones in the market compared to last year. I think we can agree with this. Second, still on phones, we are now in a position compared to last year where we're offering installment billing, we were just beginning last year and it was just ramping up. And so that's another positive. From an internal standpoint, I would also highlight that last year we did something pretty much right around this time, which was the reorganization of our field structure. Remember, we talked about this. This was a very material reorganization. We're very happy with the outcome of that reorganization but as you can imagine, this was disruptive at the time. So these are illustrations of what is leading to a better outcome \u2013 expected outcome in Q2 of this year versus last year. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. Thank you for that. And then a follow up maybe for Sharon. Some good detail on the outlook for Q2. If we're backing into it right, it looks like you're thinking about the domestic gross margin flattening out or maybe declining. I was wondering if you could verify that and maybe what changes from Q1 where the gross margin performance was pretty good. Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : Yeah. So, we're not guiding individual line items. And depending on how you're modeling, you could potentially come into a margin within a fairly wide range based on the guidance that we gave you. Again, what we're anticipating, of course, is that we're going to see positive revenue. And when we see that, depending on the mix of that revenue, we'll see how that plays out. It gets into some of the discussions that we had about this increase in volume and some of these categories you're seeing declining ASPs, but you're going to see more volume. We're expecting to see a strong \u2013 remember what we said, strong product cycle in television. So that is a possibility. But I think that when we look at our business, it is difficult by line item to give future outlooks. From an execution point of view, obviously we do feel like we are going to have a solid outcome. Now, remember, on the OI rate, Q2 is going to be one of our big quarters of our investments in our growth initiatives. Across the board, in just about every one that we laid out, there is a layering in of expense in the second quarter. So on the SG&A side, while you may see it in gross profit in the way you've modeled, I would tell you that on the SG&A side is where we actually are anticipating to see much more pressure. So gross profit is interesting, but actually the place where the Q2 \u2013 and this started, we talked about this even last quarter, it hasn't changed. What did change as far as those investments went, what did change is the fact that we're going to have the higher revenue in the domestic business, which gives us certainly more leverage of those investments in Q2. So that was a little circular way, you asked me a specific question, I had to go to the SG&A because in your modeling, you're looking at it gross profit, but it's really SG&A. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker): Okay. That is helpful. Thank you very much. Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Seth Sigman, Credit Suisse. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thanks very much and nice progress in the quarter, guys. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): The $0.10 to $0.20 impact from the Canada restructuring, how is that weighted throughout the rest of the year? Is it heavily weighted to Q2 or pretty balanced? And then if you look at the other side of that as you think about the potential benefits from the consolidations, I realize it's early, but what type of transfer rate are you seeing on those stores that you're consolidating early on? And just in general what type of benefits, if any, are included in the outlook at this point? Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : I'm going to let Hubert talk about how the Canadian consolidation is progressing. And then when he's finished, I'll come back and talk about the $0.10 to $0.20. Hubert, do you want to take that? Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Thank you for the opportunity to lay out what's happening in Canada. This was obviously a very significant decision we made. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we've closed the stores that we were going to close. We've also closed the Future Shop site. The Best Buy stores are doing great. There's a lot of momentum there. The remaining Future Shop stores, the 65 that are open and that are converting to Best Buy are very much in a period of transition. It's very important to understand. If you go to Toronto or Vancouver, you're going to be surprised because you're going to see Future Shop stores that are operating with sales associates wearing a blue T-shirt. And so that's a bit confusing for the customer. So let me describe now what's ahead of us. What's ahead of us, over the summer we're going to re-sign, if you will, or change the signage and really convert the Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores. So by the end of the summer, they will look like Best Buy stores. And that's going to take the next three months. The other thing that we're very excited about \u2013 well, let me first say I'm very proud of one thing which is how our Canadian team has remained extremely focused on serving the customers during that period of time, so I have to salute them there. What we are excited about is the work that the team started to do after we announced, because remember that before the announcement, this was a fairly closely held decision. So we started to work with our vendor partners in Canada and we started to work on the design of the stores of the future, if I can call them that. Very encouraged by the reaction from the vendor community that see the change we've made as a material opportunity because it's given the opportunity to invest in fewer stores and make them great, which is the essence of this transition to multichannel. When you go to the store, the customer experience needs to be amazing. So the teams are working on this design. Later this year, we will implement in a few stores, we're still defining exactly how many, but it's likely to be a handful roughly speaking, of stores that are going to be representative of what the stores are going to look like in the future. In these stores, there will be disruptions because it's a complete revamp of the store and we'll see how it does during holiday. And next year, we will expand that to the remainder of the chain. So this is really next year after we've done the conversions and the investments that we will have a good sense of where the ongoing retention will be. So far, we're pleased by what we're seeing, but I don't think it's meaningful, right, as the essential idea was not simply to close stores because the customers, you're not doing anything for the customer but to reinvent the customer experience as we move forward. And I think what we're going to see is going to be exciting, but it's going to be a journey as many things we do. Sharon, about the $0.10 to $0.20? Sharon L. McCollam - EVP, Chief Financial & Administrative Officer : Yes, so within that range, first of all, we feel very comfortable within that range. In Q2, you're going to see obviously a bigger impact than Q1. Remember, we only had one month in Q1. So I think that I've actually given you specific OI rate guidance for Q2, so there's no mystery in what Q2 is. Last year the international rate was a negative 3%. They're coming up against a very weak quarter last year, so the impact doesn't look as big in Q2. But if you got to the low end of the range that I provided on the outlook, which was a negative 5% for Canada, that would be looking something like a $0.01 or so of negative impact to the EPS. And then in Q3, it's going to get bigger and the largest piece of it's going to come in Q4. You got to remember that in Canada historically, their jump from Q2 to Q3 on revenue if you just look at the international segment is much bigger than the way the U.S. jumps from Q2 to Q3 and then it jumps again from Q3 to Q4. So that's how you should be modeling your impact as you look there. And then in Q3, as Hubert mentioned, all the work that we will be able to get done this year, we will of course do before we go into holiday. So Q3 gets some pressure from that as well. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you for all that color. I appreciate it. And if I could just clarify when you say that the Best Buy stores in Canada are doing great, is that a result of transferring sales from the closed stores? And if so, is there any implication for the U.S. store base and how you're thinking about that longer-term? Thanks. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. Yes. So the positive comments about the Best Buy stores in Canada is very much related to the impact of the store closures. As it relates to the U.S., the situation \u2013 I would say two things. We've always said that we would on an ongoing basis optimize our store footprint, so I will reiterate that. That said, the situation in Canada is completely different from the U.S. In Canada, the store footprint was driven by these two brands. So again, for those of us who have been to Canada, we have seen these parking lots where you had the Best Buy store and in the same parking lot quite often the Future Shop store. So that is a gift from heaven, right, because the retention there is going to be quite extraordinary if we manage to create something great for the customers in the remaining stores. The configuration of the store footprint in the U.S. has nothing to do with that because we've always had only one brand. And so it's not the same kind of opportunity which we saw in Canada or in what our Canadian teams saw is the fact that as many of you would have guessed, consolidating the two brands was the right thing to do and was going to unlock the opportunity to save on SG&A and be able to invest with our vendor partners strategically in the remaining stores. Different situation in the U.S. That said, of course, we will look. We're always learning, so we will look at what we can learn from the Canadian experience but the translation is not going to be immediate. I want to be very clear about that. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : And we'll go next to Joe Feldman, Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Wanted to ask \u2013 you guys have talked about services and the efforts that are going on there but, I guess, are there other maybe specific things you could talk about, I guess, within that? Hubert, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned we need to identify the pain points and fix them quickly, and I was just wondering if you had an example or two that you could share that that maybe where you are doing that? Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, thank you for your comments, because indeed, services is a big part of our competitive advantages. One area that I've commented upon is appliance delivery and installation. It's a big part of our growth strategy. And doing appliance delivery and installation right is not easy. You're talking about moving (57:57), making sure it's not damaged in the process, then delivering it in people's homes. If there is installation work related to gas or electricity or water, getting licensed professional into people's homes and coordinating the entire process is an area where \u2013 that we identified candidly as an area of opportunity, where we have high standards at Best Buy, where we want to make this great and a source of differentiation. So there's a process redesign work going on, both impacting the online buying experience as well as the in-store buying experience because everything needs to go well at every step in the process. So that's an example of fixing pain points. On the flip side, an example of providing an inspiring customer experience which is the \u2013 increasingly we're going to spend more time on the latter. And I would highlight a couple of things that we are excited about and that I've recently mentioned, which is the in-home consultations provided today by, in particular, by our Magnolia teams and that would apply to probably everyone on the phone. If one day you feel that your network is not functioning properly, and I'm assuming that that would be a widespread phenomenon or if you're asking yourself questions about how your audio or video system should evolve, we provide the service where we'll go to your home and will have a professional that will work with you, understand your situation, your needs, and come up with something that is a range of solutions. And when you think about the entire room around video, around entertainment, around productivity, around your home office, around security, around access to content, there's so many complex areas and being able to go to your home is something that is very inspiring. Similarly, classes, we've deployed \u2013 we're deploying in a number of our stores, camera experience stores where we have a hub and spoke system, a bigger assortment, better staffing, better expertise. We are also doing classes in these camera experience stores and for those of us who are passionate about photography, this is something that is inspiring, creates traffic to the stores, create, of course, add-on sales opportunities. So these are the range of examples that we're working on and that can provide opportunities for us. Hubert Joly - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: With this said, I'm looking at the clock and, operator, with your permission, this will be the last question. I want to thank all of you on the call for your continued support, your kind comments this morning. We're working hard on your behalf to continue to deliver great experiences for the customers and great results for our investors. So the journey will continue, and we look forward to continuing to updating you on our journey. You have a great day. Thank you so much. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to the Best Buy Second Quarter Fiscal 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 11 :00 A.M. Eastern Time today. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien - Vice President, Investor Relations : Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning. Today's release and conference call both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparison, but should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release. Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. In today's earnings release and conference call we refer to consumer electronics industry trends. The consumer electronics industry, as defined and tracked by The NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets, not including Kindle, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, gaming, movies, music, appliances or services. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Mollie, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with an overview of our second quarter results. We'll then provide highlights of the progress we're making against our priorities and then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. So first, our financial results. The results we're reporting today are strong with both significant top line and bottom line growth in the domestic business. We believe these better-than-expected results are affirmation that our strategy of offering advice, service and convenience at competitive prices is paying off. So more specifically, Enterprise revenue grew 0.8% to $8.5 billion, driven by a 3.9% increase in the domestic segment, partially offset by the impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and 120 basis points of pressure from foreign currency. Better year-over-year performance in the Domestic segment drove a 50-basis-point increase in the Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to 3.4%, and a 17% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS to $0.49. We also returned $321 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases in addition to $81 million in regular dividends. In the Domestic business, our comparable sales increased 2.7%, excluding the impact of installment billing, driven by continued strong performance in major appliances, large-screen televisions and mobile phones. Online comparable sales increased 17%, as our investments in new capabilities continued to drive increased traffic and higher conversion rates. We also saw industry revenue in the NPD-tracked categories, which represents 65% of our revenue, improved from a decline of 5.3% in Q1 to a decline of 1.3% in Q2. In the International business, while revenue declined due to store closures and foreign currency, we're seeing higher-than-expected retention from the 66 permanently-closed Future Shop locations in Canada. We're now in the midst of converting the remaining 65 Future Shop locations to the Best Buy brands. And much of the work in investments around building a superior multi-channel customer experience are still ahead of us, as we will discuss later in the call today. Now before I share specific highlights on our progress on key fiscal 2016 initiatives, I'd like to discuss a few strategic observations about what we believe has been driving our recent performance. And while recognizing the current turbulence in the financial market, we do feel this is an opportune time to do this as it is almost three years to the day of my appointment and nearly three years since the launch of our Renew Blue strategy. Our first observation is that overall consumer demand for technology products and services including appliances and mobile phones is growing. This growth is driven by technology and product innovation and by micro factors such as population growth, the housing recovery and healthy living trends that are driving momentum in our appliance, home theater, connected homes and health and wearables business, which, we believe, will remain positive catalyst in quarters to come. In addition, the increasing complexity and interoperability of technology products and the advent of the Internet of Things are making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant as customers want and need more help selecting, installing, connecting, integrating, using, maintaining and taking full advantage of their products. Our second observation, which I mentioned earlier, is that the investments that we've made in our Renew Blue strategy to offer advice, service and convenience at competitive prices are paying off. This is evidenced by the market share gains we have achieved in the NPD-tracked categories, our growth in appliances and mobile phones and the overall positive domestic comps and expanded operating income rate that we have delivered both last year and year-to-date this year. Our third and final observation is that we have three distinct competitive advantages that help us win with customers, drive better financial results and are hard for competitors to replicate. The first competitive advantage is our ability to serve our customers online, in-store, and in their home. What does this mean? We now offer a leading-edge digital shopping experience to our customers online and in our new mobile app and we also have stores within 15 minutes of 70% of the U.S. population that not only provide advice, service and convenience to our in-store customers, but also operate as local distribution centers to provide online customers with greater inventory availability and faster delivery. And for Geek Squad, we're able to provide an array of services to our customers remotely in our stores and in their home. The second competitive advantage is our positioning in the marketplace, which allows us to benefit from early adopters, who choose Best Buy when new exciting technology is released. And our strong merchandising and vendor partnerships allow us to showcase the best of what is selling, which, in turn, positions us to outperform the sales trends within the NPD-tracked consumer electronic categories even when they are negative. This leads us to our third competitive advantage, which is our vendor partnerships. Not only do we showcase the best of what our vendors offer, we're also benefiting from the material investments that several of the world's leading technology companies are making in our stores. With these partnerships, we're able to bring to life interactive technology experiences that again make the Best Buy operating model more relevant for customers. And as you'll hear later in the call, our vendor partnerships are continuing to grow, confirming that they're bringing value not only to our customers and Best Buy, but also to our vendor partners. So now with these observations as a backdrop, I'd like to discuss our progress on key fiscal 2016 initiatives. This quarter, I'm going to start with services as it is a critical component of our Renew Blue strategy. We have significant services assets today, including our ability to assist customers in our stores remotely and in their homes. We currently have approximately 20,000 Geek Squad agents and Magnolia System designers, and we're proud of the services we offer as we generate some of our highest NPS scores. Now, two things have been negatively impacting our services top line. The first is the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranties. This has the impact of reducing our repair revenue, which at face value appears negative, but it's actually beneficial both financially and operationally. The second is the decline of our traditional warranty business. We are addressing this decline by materially renewing our service offerings to make them compelling and price competitive. More broadly, we're ramping up our strategic investments in our services business to make it play an increasing role in our Renew Blue transformation, as a differentiator, as a business driver and as a profit center in its own right. In this context, we have several new developments to share this quarter. They're all part of evolving this business from a traditional warranty business to a value-added services business that addresses the help our customers need. So first, in our computing and tablet service categories, beginning September 13, we're launching a range of services, including Geek Squad Protect & Support Plus, which combines hardware support, 24/7 software support and accidental damage in one plan priced very competitively. Second, we will also begin selling AppleCare later this quarter, and additionally, we will proceed to roll out our capabilities as an Apple-authorized service provider first with in-store pilots in 50 locations by holiday. Third, we've begun to offer a range of classes to help customers take advantage of their technology products, including in our digital imaging hubs, in our Samsung Experience Shops and in our Windows Stores around the launch of Windows 10. In support of this services strategy, we are investing in talent, systems and processes to further enhance the quality and scope of the services we deliver to our customers. We're also continuing to drive operational and cost efficiencies, which are resulting in reduced repair costs and a higher year-over-year gross profit rate. I'll now turn to our progress on our merchandising initiatives. In appliances, we've rolled out 35 of the 60 additional Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store planned for this year, increasing their presence to 152 of our stores. We also began the rollout of our expanded Samsung Appliance Experiences and expect to roll out approximately 225 Samsung Open Houses by the end of the year, which will be the largest dedicated in-store display of Samsung appliances in the U.S. In home theater, we've continued to solidify our position as the destination for customers to discover and interact with industry-leading home theater technology, particularly, ultra-high definition or 4K TVs. We've expanded our Samsung home theater stores-within-a-store from 500 at launch to 603 and the Sony home theater stores-within-a-store from 350 at launch to 372. We've also rolled out 5 of the 20 planned Magnolia Design Center stores-within-a-store for this year, increasing their presence to 63 of our stores. And as we enter the back half of the year and as pricing of these technologies becomes even more affordable, we believe that we will continue to benefit from the customer moving to larger-screen televisions and 4K technology. In computing, we believe we are optimally positioned to help customers transition to the new Windows 10 operating system that was introduced at the end of July. We have a very large selection of laptops with Windows 10 already installed and a compelling in-store experience with Windows store-within-a-store. Today, we have over 600 of these in the U.S. and expect to have over 800 by holiday. We've also been working with Apple to update the 740 stores-within-a-store that were first implemented in 2007. The stores-within-a-store will have new Apple fixtures and are larger with more display tables for phones, computers and tablets. We've already implemented approximately 350 of them and expect to upgrade a total of approximately 520 by holiday. The additional display tables are great for the merchandising of Apple Watch, which went on sale on BestBuy.com and in more than 100 of our stores in August. Now because demand for Apple Watch has been so strong in these stores and online, we are excited to share that beginning September 4 we will be carrying Apple Watch in more than 900 of our big-box stores. Apple Watch will be available in all 1,050 of our big-box stores and in approximately 30 of our Best Buy Mobile Stores by the end of September. Now I'd like to share some of the recent developments related to our online experience. In the second quarter, we continued to leverage our ship-from-store, digital marketing and enhanced website functionality to drive a 17% increase in domestic comparable online sales. This growth was driven, number one, by a significantly increased number of our online customers, who received and took advantage of our free two-day shipping promise, enabled by enhancements through our ship-from-store capability and supply-chain investments that are driving improved speed, convenience and reliability. Number two, increased by the increased visibility of open-box and clearance inventory and number three by the expansion of online-only flash sales. We also launched several customer-facing site improvements, including expanded payment options for our customers through partnering with American Express to offer Pay With Points, the ability to search and shop by brand, and a significantly more relevant recommendation engine. Turning to costs. To-date, we have eliminated $100 million in annualized cost as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over three years. These savings will be offset, however, by the incremental investments in our future growth initiatives, which, for this year, we expect to be approximately $120 million. To-date, we've invested approximately $65 million to fund these initiatives of which $35 million was in the second quarter. So to repeat, we're proud of the results we're reporting today. As we look forward, the combination of an opportunity-rich environment and the strength of our competitive advantages lead us to have a positive outlook about our future prospects, starting with the important back-to-school third quarter. And so, of course, we'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and contributions to our success. The opportunities we have before us today are possible because of the talent and engagement of our entire team, and I'm extremely proud of their performance and ability to win. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our second quarter financials and our third quarter outlook. Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter better-than-expected results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Our Enterprise revenue of $8.5 billion exceeded our expectations due to a stronger-than-expected overall performance in our Domestic business in addition to higher sales retention from previously closed stores in our Canadian brand consolidation. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.4% also exceeded our expectations due to a higher gross profit rate in our computing business, a higher gross profit rate in our services business due to a periodic profit-sharing payment from our externally-managed extended service plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment and a better-than-expected performance of our credit card portfolio. As Hubert said, we are extremely proud of the team who drove these better-than-expected results. I will now talk to you about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.8% to $8.5 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 to $0.49, driven primarily by stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business from higher sales volume, improved gross profit rates and a $0.04 periodic profit-sharing payment in deferred revenue adjustments that we just discussed. These year-over-year increases were partially offset by a negative $0.02 impact from a higher effective income tax rate due to a discrete tax benefit in Q2 fiscal 2015 that did not recur this year. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.9% to $7.9 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 2.7%, excluding the benefit from installment billing, an estimated 110-basis-point benefit associated with installment billing, and a 30-basis-point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing payment and deferred revenue adjustment in services. Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 17%, driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 90 basis points to 8.6% versus 7.7% last year. Versus last year's growth rate of 22%, this year's online growth rate of 17% was lower primarily due to lapping over 100,000 basis points of growth from ship-from-store in Q2 last year. The ship-from-store impact will continue through the back half of this year. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in major appliances, televisions, mobile phones and health and fitness was partially offset by ongoing declines in tablets. In services, revenues declined 13.1%. As Hubert discussed earlier, this is primarily due to lower repair revenue and, to a much lesser extent, declining attach rates in our traditional warranty business. Since we expect this trend of lower repair revenue to continue, which is a positive, comparable sales and services are expected to continue to decline through the back half of this year. In our International segment, revenue declined 25.6% to $650 million due to the loss of revenue associated with the closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,200 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and Canadian consumer electronics industry. Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 24.4%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 120 basis points to 24.6%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in our mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity, a rate improvement in computing hardware, an increased mix of higher-margin, large-screen televisions, a 25-basis-point impact from the periodic profit-sharing payment in deferred revenue adjustment we previously discussed, and a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower margin tablet category. These increases were partially offset by a lower rate in the mobile category, driven by increased sales of higher-priced iconic mobile phones, which deliver higher gross profit dollars, but carry a lower gross profit rate. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 22.9%. Now turning to SG&A, Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.8 billion, or 21% of revenue, an increase of $57 million, or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.6 billion, or 26% of revenue, an increase of $114 million, or 70 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by investments in future growth initiatives, in addition to SG&A inflation and higher incentive compensation. International non-GAAP SG&A was $170 million, or 26.2% of revenue, a decrease of $57 million, at a rate increase of 20 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 20-basis-point increase is driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred approximately $0.02 of negative non-GAAP diluted EPS in the first half of the year, which was lower than expected due to retaining sales at a higher-than-expected rate. As such, we are reducing our estimated impact of the consolidation to a range of $0.10 to $0.17 in fiscal 2016 versus our original estimate of negative $0.10 to $0.20 as the retention rate trends are expected to continue in the back half of the year. By quarter, this expectation is broken down as follows. The negative $0.02 per share that we incurred in the first half, a negative $0.04 to $0.06 per share in Q3 and a negative $0.04 to $0.09 per share in Q4. Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and more profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. From a balance sheet perspective in the second quarter, we returned over $400 million in cash to our shareholders, $321 million through share repurchases and $81 million in regular dividends. In addition, in the last two weeks, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's upgraded Best Buy's debt rating by one notch. Moody's raised their rating to Baa1 and Standard & Poor's raised theirs to BB+. I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, our competitive advantages and strong execution give us a positive outlook on our domestic performance versus the industry, which bodes well for us, as we enter the third quarter. It is difficult to know, though, if the recent volatility in the financial markets will affect overall consumer spending. To-date, however, we have not seen a measurable impact versus our original expectations. So, as such, our outlook assumes that there will be no material changes in consumer spending in the third quarter. With that said, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q3 fiscal 2016 is as follows. In the Domestic business, we are expecting flat to low-single-digit revenue growth, and an approximately flat operating income rate driven by a higher gross profit rate offset by increased SG&A due to inflation and growth-related investments. In the International business due to the ongoing impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation and foreign currency, we are expecting an international revenue decline of approximately 30% and an international non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of negative 2.5% to negative 3.5%. With these expectations, which assume continued strength in our domestic business offset by the near-term impacts of Canada, at the Enterprise level, we expect a flat to negative low-single-digit revenue growth rate and an operating income rate growth of flat to negative 20 basis points. This includes an approximately 15-basis-point negative year-over-year impact in the Domestic business due to an $11.5 million or $0.02 per share legal settlement that we received in Q3 of last year that will not recur this year. Additionally, we expect the non-GAAP effective income tax rate from continuing operations to be in the range of 39% to 40% versus 38.1% last year, which could result in a negative $0.01 year-over-year non-GAAP diluted EPS impact in Q3 fiscal 2016. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to Anthony Chukumba from BB&T. Anthony Chinonye Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First off, congrats on a blowout quarter. One thing that jumped out at me or one of the many things that jumped out at me was the 21% comps or sales growth in appliances. I was just wondering what would you attribute that to? And then second off, how sustainable do you think that is going forward \u2013 I mean, maybe not at that rate, but the double-digit rate? Thank you. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Anthony. Thank you for your comments. So we are seeing sustained growth now over many, many quarters in our appliance business. This is driven by, number one, the markets. The housing recovery continues to be strong and you're seeing the customers equip their new house or replace their old appliances. That's a very positive factor. And then second, investments in the appliance sector continue to be very strong. The deployment of the Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store, in particular, is helping us drive better customer experience and market share, in particular, not only in the extreme high-end but also in the better and best part of the market, which is where a lot of the interesting action is. We're also investing in the customer experience from an appliance delivery and installation standpoint. So these are very fundamental and sustained improvements. Now, Anthony, this may fluctuate a little bit quarter-after-quarter, but we do expect continued traction, including given the competitive environments that I won't elaborate on, but we expect to continue to see positive performance in that segment. Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : And, Anthony, in addition to that, I'll just add one supply chain driver of this as well. We made a significant change in how we source inventories through our distribution network in the U.S., which unlocked a substantial amount of inventory for both our online business and for our individual stores in market. And that is also a driver of this and that will, too, continue as we move forward. Anthony Chinonye Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I wanted to ask about the TV category. It seems like we're in a sweet spot here. How did \u2013 the pace of price drops in the category, are they occurring, sort of, in line with expectations? How did performance trend, let's say, in the second quarter relative to the past couple of quarters? And is the elasticity there such that you can continue to see accelerating comps into the back half? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yes, Chris. The price drops that every one of us, as a consumer can track, are very material. And so the prices at which one can buy a 4K TV now very, very exciting. We expect that this will continue in the second half. As we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, these TVs are becoming very affordable. And, of course, the innovation and the material change in picture quality is very helpful. So we expect the market to continue to do well in large TVs and 4K TVs. And, of course, the second factor, a bit like in appliances, the way we merchandise and the customer experience in our stores, with investments we've made together with some of our key partners, with Samsung, with Sony, with LG, and the Magnolia Design Centers allow us to really perform particularly well in that market. So we see a number of very strong drivers of performance getting into the back half of the year. Now, of course, as we get into the start of the cycle, as you would expect, the margins are not going to continue at the same level, so, factor this in, but it's a very powerful cycle. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then, as a follow-up, I think, Sharon, last year you talked about some back-to-school timing shifting some demand into July. And we've heard a lot of other retailers talk about this shift unwinding and going the other way into August. So any commentary that you can share on the cadence and your thoughts on August so far and any potential lifts you've seen from shift. Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Yeah... Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead... Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Oh, go ahead... Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I was just going to say the outlook that we've provided today on back-to-school in the quarter incorporates what we've seen so far, right, as you would expect. And so the projection reflects what has been happening since the beginning of the quarter. So I think we've made some positive comments on the overall back-to-school in our Q3 in general. So that's reflected. Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : But, Chris, we also last year \u2013 that may have been a discussion from other retailers, but that was not a dialog that we had in our conference call last year. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Chris. Operator : We'll go next to Kate McShane of Citi. Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Good morning. My question centered around holiday 2015 and the expectations for the promotional environment. Just with some of the robustness, especially, in TVs, do you expect any alleviation in price competition as innovation remains pretty exciting going into the holiday season year-over-year? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Good morning, Kate. Let me say one thing about Q4. Because we are the leader in the category and because any comments I would make today are highly sensitive from a competitive standpoint, you're going to find us relatively shy in terms of making comments that could be used against us, if I can put it this way. What we have said in our prepared remarks is that we believe there are powerful trends from a demand standpoint around appliances, around TVs, around health and fitness and wearables and around connected home. The other thing I would say, more broadly speaking, not specific to Q4 from a competitive standpoint, if we step back a little bit and I could have included that in my remarks about the last three years, it feels \u2013 I don't know whether all of you will agree with that, but that the competitive landscape has, indeed, changed a little bit in the last three years. There's a number of players, who have decided to de-emphasize or, in some cases, exit their category. And so that's an important factor. It's true that it's a tough category. So here you go. The other thing that has changed in the last three years, that is actually very notable, is the fact that today 89% of the U.S. population lives within states, where one of our online competitor, headquartered in Seattle, now collects the sales tax. And so three years ago, it was less than 50%. It was probably around 40%. So that's a very material change over a period of three years. So, altogether, from a strategic standpoint, we see these growth drivers, and I would add, based on your question that the competitive landscape has changed somewhat in the last three years. Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I appreciate that. Thank you. And just another question. I mean, the number of initiatives with the shop-in-shops and some of the new news that you announced with Apple today with AppleCare and the updating of the shop-in-shop, how do you let your customers know about all these changes? And is it something that you're seeing the customers respond to? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you, Kate. Marketing, we've not commented on marketing on this call. We've commented on marketing on every one of our previous call. We've had a very material transformation of our marketing efforts in the last three years, with the headline being, of course, more personalized. We went from analog and mass communication to much more targeted, relevant, personalized and digital communications. So as it relates to the shops-within-the-shop, one of the things, of course, is that there's not one of each in every store. So, as an example, we have the ability to target the messages in a relevant fashion, or we have the ability to target previous users of a particular brand and communicate the news and excitement about new product introductions. More broadly speaking, I am very excited about these how these partnerships with our key vendors have evolved. It's more than just about the physical layout in the stores. These are very close partnerships. These leading tech companies invest billions of dollars in R&D. They have some very exciting new products, of course, regularly coming to market. And the collaboration that Best Buy has with some of these, of the foremost companies on the planet in the tech sector, is very inspiring. That includes from a merchandising standpoint, that's from a marketing standpoint and now also from a services standpoint. And so, yes, it's an entire collaboration. And I think we can attribute some of our performance to this more targeted, more relevant communications, customer database Athena has been now busy at work. Athena is a very busy company over the last one or two years. And we had always said it would be a gradual implementation and exploitation. And I think we're getting better and better at this. Katharine McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to David Schick of Stifel. David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, David. David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: You talked about the Canadian recapture rate being better than, I think, you had expected. Just a quick question there. Is that conservative assumptions as you planned it, or something that you're doing or adapting to? I'm curious how that's working. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I mean, David, in general, we're very pleased with the way the Canadian strategy is being implemented. Our team \u2013 this was heavy lifting consolidating two brands into one, closing 66 doors, converting 65 stores and then investing in the customer experience. So, so far, things are really progressing very nicely. The reason we don't give specific numbers, again, in part, for competitive reasons; two, it's early days; and three, as all of you know, North of the border, the economy, which is highly dependent on raw materials and the oil sector in particular has been impacted. The exchange rate is down, which is, of course, increasing the prices of consumer electronics product, which is slowing down demand. So today, the better-than-expected retention is somewhat offset, of course, by the weakness of the Canadian economy. I think we'll be able to assess with reliability the final results once we're through the conversion and once we've upgraded the customer experience. But altogether, it was obviously the right thing to do. And it's progressing quite nicely in a somewhat challenged Canadian economy. David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. As a follow-up question, you talked a little bit about the closer work with vendors and product launches, I think, in response to Kate's prior question. Could you talk about how a product launch from a vendor works today versus a few years ago? How Best Buy's interaction with a vendor on launching a product if we stepped back and looked at it versus three years ago? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : David, that's \u2013 how much time do you have? David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: (40:37) as long as you keep going. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Because it really varies by vendor base. We have such a variety of vendors. In some cases, we actually work very much upstream, including in terms of product design and the choice of feature functionalities, and then this co-designing, the customer experience and in the marketing. In some cases, it's more about the merchandising and the marketing. So there's a whole range, but it's \u2013 in general, what I would highlight is that it is \u2013 it happens earlier on. It's more strategic, it's more integrated and it's working. That would be the summary. Now to our conference we would need to schedule separately. David A. Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll go next to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Unknown Speaker : Good morning. This is actually (41:32) for Simeon. I just have a question around lapping the iPhone 6 sales from last year. Can you measure the incremental traffic that brought to the stores? And then, what do you see as a potential impact from \u2013 maybe iWatch is potentially offsetting that? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : So your question is, does the launch of an iconic product generate traffic to the stores? The answer is yes. And increasingly, again, that's one of the things we're working on with our key vendors is to make it more dramatic and more unique and more differentiated vis-\u00e0-vis any of the other retailers. So I would say yes to that question. As it relates to your second question is, does the Apple Watch momentum compared to the phone \u2013 that would be too much detail, I think, at this point. I think I would say we're very excited by, again, the early momentum of Apple Watch in our stores, which, obviously, a triggered decision that we've made with Apple to have an accelerated and expanded rollout. So we think that's a very exciting news. It's also reflective of how these partnerships, the strength of these partnerships lead to more opportunities. Unknown Speaker : All right. Great. Thanks. But, specifically, around the iPhone 6, are you able to like quantify the incremental traffic from last year? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : We didn't release anything last year, Simeon, (43:00) around the traffic, but, obviously, we had substantial traffic associated because, as you'll recall, one of our big callouts in our revenue in Q3 was related to the iPhone 6. But it was actually from a revenue point of view and from a units point of view, if you recall, it was very much about the revenue, and not the units. So when you think about that, because it's higher dollars. So I would say that it was certainly a traffic driver and we are thrilled to have a new traffic driver this year, something very iconic. I think we can all agree the Apple Watch is certainly iconic and having it in all 1,000 stores by the end of September is a big deal for us. Unknown Speaker : Okay, guys, thanks. And then, my follow-up is around Project Athena and some of your price optimization initiatives. Can you just talk about where you are with those and are they expected to be in place by the holidays? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : So there's two components. Athena is really our customer database, which allows us to have this greater personalization and more relevant, more targeted communication. So I think that we'll benefit from that during holiday. I think what you've seen these last couple of quarters is very indicative of our capabilities. And we'll continue to incrementally improve that in the coming quarters. As it relates to the second part of your question, which is the promotional discipline, this is an area we have invested in. I think if I step back over the last three years, we've had several phases. One is we established a price match policy. Two, we have invested significantly in our price competitiveness, starting with hardware and then accessories. You've heard me talk this morning about services. We have previewed that in previous quarter, but with the launch of Geek Squad Protect & Support Plus that's another step forward. And then, the other dimension we're talking about, which we had talked about last year, is the promotional discipline. We're applying more science and more tools to this area to make sure that the return on the promotional dollars is getting better and better. So we're continuing to see improved progress in this area. And we'll continue to deploy this as we move forward. We are a very data and science-driven management team here on matters like that. Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : And, Simeon, (45:33) going into holiday, though, and Q3 as well, with Athena, Athena is gradually and incrementally getting better and smarter every quarter. We have made substantial investments every single quarter. When you look at these growth investments that we have been making, a significant number of those have been directly in our ability to use Athena and the database. We've also brought in additional talent into the company in that area; some very sophisticated talent. And that, of course, is advancing us. So when we go into holiday this year, we are definitely going to have a more robust experience for our customers coming out of the efforts that we put forward with Athena. Unknown Speaker : All right. Great. That was very helpful. Thank you. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Two questions. One, just on your store count, you're about flat year-over-year. I think you've closed maybe 50 stores out of 1,100 stores since you guys became the management team. As I recall from past conversations, you have a lot of leases that come up for renewal in 2016. Can you just update us on your thoughts on what your long-term store count should be? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Yes. So first, the 49 stores that you might be thinking of, actually, were closed prior to us joining the company. So the first point that you made was actually just prior to Hubert joining, so just to round set on that fact. Since then, what we are doing, we do have a significant amount of our leases expiring. It's a substantial number and our strategy has not changed. As we are looking at each lease, we will rationalize as we think is appropriate. Last year, we closed five stores. And this year, we'll walk into the year and we will be assessing the leases and determining what that would look like. But there is no announcement to be made. We consistently have said that targeting a store count, we're targeting rationalization of our footprint, particularly, in our multi-store markets, and to the extent that we have redundancy or stores that we feel should not be in the network long-term. Of course, we'll close those. We're not reluctant to close them. But, right now, as we've talked about consistently, we do not have \u2013 look at these numbers \u2013 we do not have a list of stores that we have negative cash flows, or significant issues with. So, that's the great news. We don't have a story to tell about our portfolio that is not performing. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Yeah, excellent point. A second question, if I could, can you quantify the gross profit rate benefit of the change in the mobile warranty plan this quarter? I mean, do you list them in your press release in order of the magnitude? And then, a related question. I think you start to lap up against that in the fourth quarter of this year. Is that right? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Yes. That's right. We do list them in order of magnitude. So that's all the information, because, again, some of this is pretty competitive. But we definitely list them in order. And I think you've got one that was quantified below it. So it's more than that. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Yes. Understood. Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on to someone else. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And, Mike, what I would say amplifying what Sharon just said, you'll find us increasingly prudent about releasing product category detailed information, because we are only focused on technology, because it's natural to ask these questions. And we're very focused on transparency, but we are also thoughtful about the help it provides to our competitors. So, hopefully, you'll understand when we feel that too much information can hurt us as a company, and therefore, can hurt our investors' trade secrets, we think, are valuable to our investors as well. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Dan Binder of Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning and congratulations on a good quarter. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : There were two things I wanted to touch on. First, you talked about increased conversion. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the change in the labor model and the dot-com acceleration, I suspect \u2013 I think you said it was a function of conversion how maybe average time to customer is coming down, if you could just touch on those two things? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Thank you for your question. There's multiple facets in your question. So let's start with the online components. Which we report online sales and it's an important part of our business, but we believe that online and mobile are a much bigger part of the business than just the online sales, because it's really front door to the store. This is where we all notice. This is where the customers start the research. So we are excited about the growth of online. We are excited about the increased traffic and the increased conversion rate. I think the improvements that have been made on the site and in the app over the last three years are just extraordinary. Now we have a long way to go, but I'm very proud now of where we are. Still continued progress to be made in the checkout, in the customer experience, significant improvement from a supply chain standpoint, it's been transformative. The speed at which we're shipping now, in particular, enabled by ship-from-store, that's been a phenomenal transformation. Now the customers may start the journey online, they often go to the stores. Now, we've always believed that as a result of these trends in consumer behavior, the store experience need to be so much better, right? Because when the customer gets to the store, she has done a lot of research and she's much more educated than maybe a few years ago. And so it's maybe that in some cases we see fewer trips to the store, because so much time has been spent before the store. And so the focus in the store is on the customer experience. So first physically and together with these vendors, we've invested significantly in the physical experience in the stores, and candidly, it is so helpful. You cannot use your senses online to see the difference in picture quality of the TV or the sound quality of a headphone. You really have to go to the store. And then, of course, there's the blue shirts. Our associates are such a formidable weapon for us. And I hope we're doing a good job this morning on thanking them on the call for their amazing performance in the entire leadership in retail. I think your question refers, in particular, to the comments we've made about the increased proficiency that we've made \u2013 that the associates have in the stores, even though we've taken $1 billion of cost out, we've actually increased the amount of customer-facing labor, and we've increased the product knowledge, the engagement and the overall sales proficiency. So we've talked about it as IST, individual sales productivity, individual sales tracking. This program has continued to be deployed. And we can measure the improvements as a particular area of focus. Our store leadership is focused on what they call \u2013 what we call value-add, which is the difference between the comps in the stores and the traffic. So it's really focused on what they control in the stores. And we're seeing continued progress from that standpoint. I'm incredibly proud of what we're seeing in the stores. Now there's more to come. I think that I'd be lying to you, if I was going to tell you that we are consistently excellent. We have a number of stores, a number of associates that still have progress to make. But it's the combination of this better in-store performance and the excellent merchandising, the supply chain, the marketing, the service components, really the integration of all these capabilities that is resulting in these better-than-expected and better period results. So continued progress on all of these fronts. Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : And I'll just add that last year, we talked about the investments that we were going to be making in IST, because our systems and our HR management tools were not set up to manage IST. We've been making progress on that. The stores are able to much more easily see performance individuals, and our stores are being able to see their actual performance and be able to be coached and to be able to work on improving that performance. And we believe, without a question, that the efforts that we have seen related to this in-store are absolutely driving these positive comps. So the implementation of IST last year, if you just go back and look at when we first started talking about IST and you look at the outcomes that we have been seeing in the retail stores, because, remember, that the retail stores delivered significantly positive comps this quarter. So we definitely believe that there is a correlation there and we are optimistic that we will continue to see longer-term improvements, as Hubert described, the proficiency that we're trying to build through this program. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : And if I could, just a follow-up on leverage and buyback. Obviously, the results have been showing improvement. Net of cash, you don't have a lot of leverage. Just curious if your thoughts around that are changing in any way. Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : No, not at \u2013 I mean, obviously, in the first quarter, we did repurchase about $321 million worth of shares. When we launched the program last quarter, I believe, we said we were going to do $1 billion over three years. There's no doubt that we are going to achieve that quicker just based on what we did in the second quarter. And we will continue to be there to support our stock. So I don't think anything's changed from our lens around maintaining a strong balance sheet. The performance clearly justifies us accelerating against that $1 billion, which you've already seen us do. So that's how we're going to \u2013 that's the best answer I can give you at this point. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Hubert for any additional or closing comments. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Well, thank you so much. In closing, I'll just repeat this. Very proud of the results. We're excited about our prospects and opportunities. Very grateful for the work of our team and continue to be very grateful for your support, as we continue to unfold our story. So we look forward to seeing you first in our stores or online, we'll be there for you, and then on our next call. So thank you very much. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

I will then provide highlights of our holiday plans, before turning the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. First, our Q3 results. In summary, we have delivered another quarter of Domestic comparable sales growth and operating income expansion. At the Enterprise level, on revenue of $8.8 billion, we increased our non-GAAP operating income rate by 40 basis points to 2.8% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS by $0.07 to $0.41, an increase of 21%. In the Domestic business, our comparable sales, excluding the impact of installment billing, increased 0.5%. This increase was the result of growth in computing, major appliances, health and wearables and large-screen televisions, partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and services. Online comparable sales increased 18% as our new mobile site and enhanced dotcom capabilities continue to drive higher conversion rates and increase traffic. I note that during Q3, industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories were down 4.3%. In the International business, we continue to see the ongoing revenue impacts of the Canadian brand consolidation store closures, foreign currency and softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry. However, the stronger product mix and a more effective promotional strategy have resulted in better-than-expected profitability. I would now like to discuss our progress on our key priorities, starting with merchandising. In Appliances, we've completed our planned rollout of Pacific Kitchen & Home stores-within-a-store for the year, adding 59 stores for a total of 176. We also rolled out 225 Samsung Open House appliance experiences, and with 20 consecutive quarters of growth in Appliances, we believe the investments we're making in this business are helping us win in the market. Furthermore, the appliance delivery and installation investments we have made this year are also driving significant improvement in our Net Promoter Scores. In home theater, with our 630 Samsung and 380 Sony stores-within-a-store and our 78 Magnolia Design Centers, we have continued to expand our industry-leading experience for customers to discover, learn about and enjoy home theater technology, especially 4K TVs. This is a significant competitive advantage for us, as 4K unit sales are expected to materially increase in the fourth quarter. In computing, we rolled out more than 150 additional Windows stores in the quarter -- in the third quarter and now have over 800. We also updated more than 130 of our Apple stores-within-a-store and now have 500 latest-generation Apple stores-within-a-store. In mobile phones, we added 225 Verizon and 225 AT&T stores-within-a-store. These shops feature highly trained specialists, who provide access to the carrier's products and services and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. Additionally, in mobile, we've added the ability for customers to buy installment billing plans online for Sprint. At this time, we are the only retailer who can offer these types of plans, both online and in-store for AT&T, Sprint and Verizon. Turning to digital. Our investments continue to drive results as illustrated by the 18% increase in Domestic online sales. In the third quarter, we provided free 2-day shipping to a significantly increased number of our online customers. We further benefited from the visibility and searchability of open box and clearance inventory. We expanded online-only flash sales. We introduced Blue Assist, a new feature in our highly rated mobile app, which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call, email or through scheduling of Blue Shirt in store. And we also launched a dedicated Windows 10 online experience that showcases the functionalities of Windows 10, offers customer training and highlights new Windows 10 devices. In addition, right after the end of the quarter, we launched the Best Buy app for iPad. Turning to marketing. Our marketing campaign helped drive a strong back-to-school performance. In the third quarter, we continued to shift our focus to social media campaigns at Millennials. We continued to increase the number of addressable emails, and we continued to improve the customer click-through rate to our website to enhance targeted marketing programs, enabled by our Athena customer database. In Services, as we discussed last quarter, we began increasing our investments to support the expanded role we're expecting Services to play in our Renew Blue transformation. The first of these investments was the September 13 launch of our new Geek Squad Services in computing in tablets. We also began selling AppleCare and piloting our new Apple-authorized service provider capabilities in more than 60 stores. Like AppleCare, our new Geek Squad Services are much more than extended warranties. They include providing 24/7 support to our customers and helping them take advantage of their technology products. We believe this focus will result in higher NPS scores and increase attach rates over time. Initially, however, we are expecting the price investments related to these rollouts to have an approximately $40 million or 25 basis points negative gross profit rate impact in the fourth quarter. Turning now to costs. To-date this year, we've eliminated a total of $110 million in annualized costs as part of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization program, which has a goal of $400 million over 3 years. These savings will continue to be offset, however, by the incremental SG&A investment in our future growth initiatives, which have totaled approximately $85 million so far this year, of which $20 million was in the third quarter. We do, however, now expect the SG&A investment to reach only $100 million this year versus the $120 million we discussed last quarter due to reducing the SG&A investment plan to partially fund the $40 million investment in Services pricing that I just discussed. Let me now turn to holiday. We are excited by what we are offering and delivering to our customers during this holiday shopping season. First, we have created an expansive assortment of amazing technology products, especially in 4K TVs, health and wearables, Appliances, connected or smart devices, drones and many other giftable items. These products will be offered at very attractive prices to our customers throughout the holiday season. Second, we have built some terrific new capabilities since last year, including: number one, a range of new digital capabilities, especially Blue Assist that I described earlier; number two, an additional 1,100 stores-within-a-store, which come on top of the over 3,700 we had a year ago; number three, the increasing expertise and proficiency of our sales people; number four, our enhanced multichannel delivery capabilities, illustrated by faster shipping, which is enabled by ship-from-store and a better in-store pickup experience; number five, the optimization of our supply chain to enable earlier store replenishments and higher order fill rates; and number six, a range of services offered to our customers, including free Geek Squad setup on top tech gifts and the ability for customers to give a gift of a Geek Squad agent's time. Also, from a marketing perspective, we believe we are entering the quarter with a high-performing media campaign, a significantly greater social media presence and more refined personalization capabilities through our investment in our Athena database. We, of course, recognize that we are up against a strong performance in the fourth quarter of last year and that the NPD industry decline that we saw in the third quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year, may continue throughout this year's fourth quarter. We have also made incremental investments in Services pricing and SG&A that are putting pressure on our fourth quarter earnings outlook, which Sharon will discuss in more detail in a moment. Now one thing we are certain about is our team's ability to execute exceptionally well throughout the holiday. We're going into the holiday clear on our priorities and our plan and with a better trained, engaged and most importantly, highly determined team. I am grateful for what they've accomplished so far this year and extremely proud of their capabilities and passion to win. I know that they are ready to deliver an outstanding performance this holiday. I'll now turn the call to Sharon to discuss the details of our third quarter financials and our fourth quarter outlook. Sharon McCollam : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I'd like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.8% exceeded our expectations due to a Domestic $0.04 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed service plan portfolio and better-than-expected profitability in our International business. Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 37.1% versus our expectations of 39% to 40%, resulting in additional $0.01 of EPS versus expectations. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. Again, Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion decreased 2.4%, driven primarily by the Canadian brand consolidation, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian economy. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 21% to $0.41. This increase was primarily driven by a stronger year-over-year performance in the Domestic business and the $0.04 periodic profit-sharing benefit that I just discussed. These increases were partially offset by a $0.02 negative impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and the lapping of a prior year inventory-related legal settlement of $0.02 that did not recur this year. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to $8.1 billion. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 0.5%, excluding the benefit from installment billing; an estimated 30 basis point benefit associated with installment billing; and a 30 basis point benefit from the periodic profit-sharing benefit. Our Domestic comparable online revenue increased 18.3%, driven by increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 130 basis points to 8.8%, versus 7.5% last year. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in computing, major appliances, health and wearables and large-screen television was partially offset by declines in tablets, mobile phones, digital imaging and Services. In Services, comparable revenue declined 11.1%, almost entirely due to lower repair revenue, and to a much lesser extent, declining attach rates of our traditional warranty plan. As we explained last quarter, the reduced frequency and severity of claims on our extended warranty has had the impact of reducing our repair revenue. While at face value, this appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial, because this repair revenue produces very little profit, and it is contributing to the positive performance of the externally managed portfolio. Additionally, in Q3, as Hubert discussed, we increased our investment in Services pricing as we expand and improve our price competitiveness in this category, particularly in computing and tablets. The impact of this price investment is expected to continue into the fourth quarter and throughout next year, of course. As we are discussing Services, I'd like to take a moment to provide more insight into the periodic profit-sharing benefits we are receiving from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio, as they have positively impacted our gross profit rate and earnings the last 2 quarters. And we are expecting a positive 55 basis point impact in Q4. These periodic benefits have been driven by substantial changes we have made to our insured warranty plan from both a plan design and cost-to-fulfill perspective. The portfolio has also seen an overall industry reduction in frequency of claims. All of these positive loss drivers have resulted in an overall lower-than-expected cost of our extended service plans, and we contractually share in that outperformance. As these periodic benefits are based on actual claims history of the externally managed portfolio, however, it is difficult to estimate any future potential impact, but we do not currently expect to see the same level of periodic profit-sharing benefits in fiscal '17. Now I will continue with our Q3 results. In our International segment, revenue declined 29.9% to $729 million due to the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry overall. Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.9%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 110 basis points to 24.1%. This increase was primarily due to the positive impact of changes in mobile warranty plans, which resulted in lower costs due to lower claim frequency and severity, which we will begin lapping in Q4; an increased mix of higher-margin large-screen televisions; a positive mix benefit from significantly decreased revenue in the lower-margin tablet category; a greater portion of vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A and a 20 basis point impact from the periodic profit-sharing benefit. These increases were partially offset by the lapping of the 15 basis point prior year inventory-related legal settlement I just discussed. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 22.4%. While both Canada and Mexico had higher year-over-year gross profit rates, a higher mix of sales from our Mexico business, which carries a lower gross profit rate, drove the 20 basis point International rate decline. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion or 21.1% of revenue, an increase of $4 million or 50 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.9% of revenues, an increase of $67 million or 60 basis points. This increase was primarily driven by a greater portion of our vendor funding being recorded as an offset to cost of goods sold rather than SG&A, investments in future growth initiatives and higher incentive compensation. This was partially offset by the flow-through of our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions. International non-GAAP SG&A was $171 million or 23.5% of revenue, a decrease of $63 million, but a rate increase of 100 basis points. This dollar increase is primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates and the elimination of expenses associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation. The 100 basis point increase is driven by the year-over-year sales deleverage. As it relates to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred a better-than-expected negative impact of $0.02 of non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter. This was the result of a more effective promotional strategy, partially offset by a weaker-than-expected Canadian economy and consumer electronics market and from a lesser extent, lower costs from our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year. As such, we are narrowing our estimated EPS impact of the consolidation this year to a range of negative $0.10 to $0.12, versus our previous estimate of negative $0.10 to $0.17. This expectation is broken down as follows : The negative $0.04 that we've incurred in the first 9 months of this year and a negative $0.06 to $0.08 in Q4. Ultimately, when our consolidation initiatives are complete, we are expecting our Canadian business to be a more vibrant and profitable business with profitability being defined as both higher operating income dollars and a higher operating income rate. From a balance sheet perspective in the third quarter, we returned over $140 million in cash to our shareholders, $64 million through share repurchases and $79 million in regular dividends, bringing our year-to-date total cash returned to over $800 million. Also during the quarter, Fitch returned our debt rating to investment grade. I would now like to talk about our financial outlook. As Hubert said earlier, we are excited about our holiday plans and new capabilities and confident in our ability to execute our plans. This gives us a positive outlook on our Domestic performance versus the industry. However, the 4.3% decline we saw in the NPD-reported categories got progressively worse throughout the quarter, which adds a level of caution to our outlook. With that, our year-over-year non-GAAP outlook for Q4 fiscal '16 is as follows : in the Domestic business, we are expecting near-flat revenue, assuming industry declines in the NPD-recorded categories are in line with Q3 at approximately negative 4%, and that the timing of the Super Bowl shift results in approximately 40 basis points of sales moving out of Q4 into Q1 fiscal '17; and a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 20 to 35 basis points, driven by gross profit rate pressure and higher SG&A. The gross profit rate pressure is primarily driven by a 25 basis point investment in Services pricing, higher distribution cost associated with our growth in the online channel and the appliance and large-screen television categories and product mix and product cycle pressures. Largely offsetting these gross profit pressures is the expected 55 basis point periodic profit-sharing benefit from our externally managed extended service plan portfolio. The higher SG&A is due to our investment in growth initiatives, partially offset by cost savings. In the International business, due to the ongoing impact of the Canadian brand consolidation, foreign currency fluctuations and softness in the Canadian market, we are expecting an International revenue decline of approximately 30% and an International non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of positive 2% to 3%. With these expectations, our enterprise-level outlook is as follows : a negative low single-digit revenue growth rate and a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of 25 to 45 basis points. From a tax rate perspective, we expect a non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 37% versus 34.2% last year, which is expected to result in a negative $0.04 to $0.06 year-over-year in Q4 '16. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Seth Sigman. Seth Sigman : So a question on the fourth quarter outlook. So it sounds like the expectation is that the industry is going to be similar to Q3 overall, but you did note that the business got progressively worse throughout the quarter. So it would seem to imply that trends will improve throughout Q4? I mean, how should we be thinking about the drivers of that overall? Hubert Joly : The drivers of forecasting the industry. Welcome to forecasting in a hit-driven business. What we're very clear about is what we control, and as we said, we're extremely well positioned to deliver. Clearly, we've been gaining market share, and so that gives us enormous confidence. Exactly what's going to be the demand during the quarter? You've seen a lot of volatility across retail categories in the last few months. So we've noted these facts. We want to be transparent with our shareholders. Our forecast reflects everything we know at this point, and you see us determined to -- irrespective of what's going to happen in the market, there's so much we control, and what we've put in place, the capabilities we have, allow us to win. And so we're in this to win this. And so I'm afraid that it's hard to directly answer your question about exactly what the demand is going to be, but we've tried our best today to give you as much transparency as possible around the categories. I would say there's a lot of excitement in a number of product categories. I mean, TVs, the demand for 4K TVs in our customer experience in this category is a great example of what we can accomplish. Appliances is less of a giftable item, maybe, but our momentum continues to be strong in the market, and that category continues to be very strong. There's a lot of excitement in health and wearables, connected devices. I'm planning to buy a drone myself, so if you want to join me, but there's these recent trends we saw at the end of the quarter that we wanted to highlight for our investors in this period of transparency. Sharon McCollam : And Seth, this is Sharon. I'll just add to that, that we believe there was another dynamic in October, which is pent-up demand with people waiting to anticipate Black Friday deals, because Black Friday, as we all know, has turned into Black November, and we believe that, that has a particularly stronger impact on the consumer electronics category than other categories. So even going from the last weeks of October to the first week of November, we just got that data off the press. We actually saw a significant improvement from the last weeks of October and the first week of November. So again, that was in our backdrop and in our -- view when we were looking at our Q4 outlook. Seth Sigman : Okay. That's very helpful. So to follow up, thinking about the promotional outlook and whether that's going to be a driver in the fourth quarter here. And you talked a lot about the price investments you're making in Services. Maybe looking beyond Services, you've made a lot of price investments over the last few years that have helped drive market share. How do you feel about your pricing in kind of the rest of the business today? And do you think there's a need to be more aggressive through this holiday period? Hubert Joly : Seth, we feel very good about our pricing. In the -- outside of Services, we've made these investments over time in hardware and accessories. I think if you follow -- if you have time to follow some of the blogs around the Black Friday deals, in particular in the TV category, which is the hard category, my sense is that the widespread sentiment is that we have the best deals for holiday in TV. So we feel really good about our price positioning, which is what I highlighted in my prepared remarks. We have not only an amazing assortment, amazing prices, and we have the quantities for consumers. So it's one thing to have an item at a price that looks great, but if you have 5 of those and then you are done, not particularly competitive. We have -- we're going to have deep inventory making the products available to the customers. Operator : We'll go next to Matthew Fassler. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot, Sharon, for that last point on the quarter-to-date trends, but I want to focus for a moment on the NPD trends that you saw over the course of Q3. Can you talk about where the erosion took place? Was it broad based? Or was it category focused? And then along with that, I know the phone market is not included in the NPD data. I also know that wireless shifted from a sales driver for you in Q2 to a category that declined in Q3. So any color you can give us on the outlook for phones, product-wise and otherwise, would be terrific. Sharon McCollam : Yes, Matt, on the NPD, I know this will sound like a strange statement, but the good news is, it actually was across all the categories. We like that because that's what really led us to our premise, especially in October, around the pent-up demand. Because it really isn't product specific. It was sort of categorically specific. So that was, in our minds, again another data point, which just says the customer was looking forward to Black Friday. Because remember, the first Black Friday deals were released in the first week of November. By some retailers, second week, they were -- we released 8 deals. So that -- we'll just follow through on that. And October was the most notable month during the 3-month period. As you pointed out, there are categories that are outside of that. Appliances is another category that is actually outside of NPD. And with that, we saw exceptional growth again this quarter, and we are so encouraged by the work that we're doing on the Appliance side. In the mobile category, we did see, I believe -- we believe the industry grew. Knowing what the industry did for mobile is very difficult, but we do believe if you look just at units that there was growth. But for us, at Best Buy, the shift of the iPhone launch by a week was not helpful. So we will see. But as you know from our remarks this morning, mobile was not our strongest category. It was one of our down categories. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Nagel. Brian Nagel : I'm going to try to phrase this in a question, but it's probably going to come across more as a comment that we can just opine upon [ph]. And it's a follow-up to, I guess, the prior 2 questions as well. But as I look at the results today, I just see a real disconnect between what seemed to be, actually, a decent Q3, and in even some of the qualitative commentary you're making about the third quarter and then into the holiday, and then the guidance that we put out there. And most importantly, the implied earnings decline of that guidance -- that is implied in that guidance. So I guess, what I'm wondering is what -- is there some type of X factor here? Is there an air of conservatism as you head into the holidays, which is -- I get. Is it a stepped-up investment cycle the last -- the next few months? What's actually happening there? Sharon McCollam : So I would say 2 things. As Hubert mentioned it in his prepared remarks and I mentioned it in my own, with NPD down 4, which was a significant change versus Q2, we believe that going into Q4, we should enter the quarter and enter the outlook that we provided today with the appropriate industry backdrop. So to your question about did we go into this with a lens around what the environment feels like : we did. When you look at other retailers that have come out in the last 2 weeks, we have seen what you've seen, which is a smattering of good news and not-so-good news. And several of the areas where the retailers tend to be catering to the higher-end consumers and have a less broad customer base, they seem to have had a slightly more impactful outlook for the fourth quarter. So we've tried to balance that between the 2, and -- but without question, we are coming into this with that as our backdrop. So is that helpful? Brian Nagel : No, that's very helpful, Sharon. It's very helpful, and then, so just to drill down one. With respect to price promotions and having followed consumer electronics now for a very long time, that's typically the biggest hurdle, if you will, competitive price promotions with -- as we head into the holidays. It doesn't seem, again, in all the points you've laid out -- it's kind of what frames your guidance. It doesn't seem as though you're expecting an overly aggressive promotional holiday, at least as of now. Is that correct? Hubert Joly : I think we expect something as usual, in general terms. Let me add a couple of comments to what Sharon was saying and to your question. The trend we're seeing is that we are outperforming the industry and that -- based on our value proposition and great execution. You saw that in Q3. You've seen what other retailers have reported as it relates to consumer electronics. And you've seen our results, and you've seen -- you've heard our confidence getting into Q4 in terms of our ability to win and execute some of the investments we're making and some uncertainty around the market, and I think you'll see us transparent on that. Regarding the price -- the promotionality, we don't see anything unusual for this quarter. In fact, if anything, it's possible that given some of the industry trends and the difficulty of competing in consumer electronics, some retailers, and we have commented on that last quarter, are less enthusiastic about this category. The potential flip side that you could see, of course, again in the spirit of transparency, if the market is bad, you can always have the risk of people wanting to liquidate their inventory, but that's not the ingoing assumption. And we think we are competitively priced, and we think we're going to win. Operator : We'll go next to Peter Keith. Peter Keith : I wanted to just ask about the growth investments that you're making, $100 million for this year. It clearly looks like these are working, and it's allowing you to take share. How should we think about this on a go-forward basis? Is this something now that we should expect maybe $100 million per year next year and going forward? Sharon McCollam : No, as a matter -- yes, we are going to continue to make investments. But as we look to fiscal '17, and we start to see benefits coming from other initiatives that we are currently working on, what our anticipation is in fiscal '17 is that the growth investments are going to be offset with cost reductions and other eliminations of waste and efficiency in the company. Peter Keith : So just to understand, would that be a net neutral impact? Or do you think with the Renew Blue cost reductions that seem to be pretty comparable to the growth investments this year that looking forward, the cost reductions would outpace the growth investments? Sharon McCollam : I think that next year, we will definitely offset the investments, and then what we recover out of the Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions, we will see some upside, but a large portion of the savings next year, again, will be offset with the investments. Peter Keith : Okay, very good. And I just want to pivot quickly to mobile. And it seems the industry is changing to more broad-based installment billing platform, and I wanted to get your take on how that might change your competitive positioning. Does that change your ability to take share? And what might it do to the frequency of upgrades in your view? Hubert Joly : Yes. The -- we're excited about the shift to installment billing. We are -- as a retailer, we are very well positioned to offer these plans, both online and in the stores, again the only one to offer that from the 3 retailers. So another thing that's going to be helpful to us is these carrier stores-within-the-stores that will continue to improve the experience for the customers. The churn in the industry is very low. So most of the customers are interested in having a very tight connection to the carrier and the degree of expertise in our stores, the dedication to individual carriers, the access, the complete access to the carriers' products and services, systems, and so forth, is going to be very helpful. And then beyond mobile as the business shifts towards connected and smart devices, one of the great assets we have, as we've talked about in the past, is our ability to connect other devices and win in that next wave of technology innovation. So as the business transitions, we're evolving the business model, and we're excited about the opportunities. Operator : We'll go next to Michael Lasser. Michael Lasser : Your guidance implies that you're going to sustain this rate of outperformance versus the industry of about 400 to 500 basis points. How long do you think you can maintain that gap with the sector? Hubert Joly : Thank you, Michael, for your question in highlighting by how much we are beating competition or winning in the marketplace. We think we have a long runway. If you average our market share across all of the categories in which we compete, it's around 15%. Now of course, it varies by product categories and types of customers, but our share of wallet of existing customers is not that high. So jokingly, I tell our teams as long as we're below 90% market share, we have a long runway. As you can appreciate, they love that. Clearly, we have a lot of runway to continue to grow. And then, of course, we're going to play where the puck is going. This industry and our business is characterized by waves of technology, and planning where the next waves are is something that Best Buy is very good at. And as the business moves to the connected devices, the Internet of Things, we are extremely well positioned to win these waves. So we see -- in the short term, we see no limits to our ability to grow that -- continue to grow that. Michael Lasser : That's helpful. My follow-up question is, Hubert, the fourth quarter in the consumer electronics space is a little different than the first 3 quarters of the year. The first 3 quarters of the year, you have to be price competitive against other players who are trafficking in consumer electronics. In the fourth quarter, in the holiday, you're competing against other product categories for wallet share. So I think everyone appreciates that your prices on consumer electronics for the Black Friday ad are competitive, but how do you think about the cross-price elasticity of demand? So if sweaters are going to be 75% off, perhaps that will look more compelling to a consumer over the next couple of months versus buying a TV that may not have as much of a discount. And if we see that shape up, will you have to get progressively more promotional as we get closer to Christmas? Especially in light of what looks like pretty heavy inventory positions, given that your inventory outpaced your sales by a few basis points. Wal-Mart and Target talked about their weakness in consumer electronics, and so arguably, the industry's heading into this holiday with a pretty heavy industry -- inventory position. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Michael. There is, indeed, a risk that I mentioned that we've talked about, which is the -- if the industry is soft, then there's this risk of people being desperate and liquidating their inventory. We don't think that's the main thesis at this point in time. But going back to the fight against the sweaters, our teams completely understand that. I mean, I'm very proud of our team, and which is one of the reasons why we bought early, and often, we start our marketing campaigns early in the season. You've seen us, in fact, before the end of October starting to talk to customers because we want to be front and center. I think that in the apparel category, I think you've seen a lot of softness, frankly. But somehow, the products in that category don't seem to be resonating that well with consumers. And in many ways, the consumer market and consumer electronics in particular, great supply creates demand, and I think the products we have, the assortment, the customer experience can be extremely exciting. If you gave me time, I could try to sell each one of you on the call some great products, but I'm not sure Sharon would let me do that. So we -- yes, we understand it's a broader battle. We understand the game is different, and we play it slightly differently than in the rest of the year, focusing on product, product availability, being price competitive and being very convenient with delivery. Our free 2-day delivery capabilities are very significant. So you can feel how excited and good we feel about this fight. Bring them over. We're ready. Sharon McCollam : And if you take a look -- I'll just add to that. When you look at the outside of Best Buy industry data points about what people believe is going to be big sellers for holiday, even NPD put out a holiday outlook. And within that, one of the top categories that they expected was around video games and tech-type items. In addition to that, they thought that one of the biggest sellers this holiday, big drivers of holiday, is going to be big screen TVs, where we continue to have such substantial share, and as you guys know, probably the best assortment in all of retail. So we are so prepared to take advantage of those, as Hubert pointed out, and we discussed in the prepared remarks. Our inventories are probably in the best position that we've ever entered a fourth quarter in recent history, and we feel very confident in our ability to execute that. And reminder that it's hard to execute when you are going into these categories that carry such large cubes. You really need capabilities in that area. I don't -- whether you're selling it through the stores or selling it online, you need very strong capabilities. Not everyone is going to come out of the chute really great at this. So I think there are a list of competitive advantage, but there are numerous external data points that you can research that are saying that this is going to be a very strong category this holiday. Operator : We'll go next to Anthony Chukumba. Anthony Chukumba : Actually had a little bit of a different question specifically on, I guess, capital allocation. You bought back over $300 million of common stock in Q2 and then you only bought back $64 million in Q3, and your stock price was pretty depressed throughout the quarter. So I guess, I was just wondering first off, why the sequential decline in terms of share repurchases in Q3 versus Q2 and also what your thoughts are going forward. Sharon McCollam : Thank you, Anthony. We will continue. As you know, we've got $1 billion authorization out there. As you pointed out, we bought over $300 million in Q3 and then the -- in Q2 and then the additional in Q3. We do expect to continue to purchase our shares under that program, and we see our stock currently just like you do, as a value. Hubert Joly : All-in. Operator : We'll go next to David Magee. David Magee : I just had 2 questions, 1 being the -- with regard to the NPD data, what do you think is driving that number lower of late? And then my second question is -- I'm curious whether you think it's the weather or is it the Texas impact or some combination? Then my second question has to do with the Service investment in price, and what your plans might be to communicate those to customers. Hubert Joly : So as relates to NPD, the change in trajectory, so you have 2 parts in your question. One is why was Q3 lower than Q2 in a sense from a trend standpoint? And what has happened during the quarter? The first thing I think we all have to recognize is the nature of this industry is to have some volatility, right? Because it's so hit driven, product innovation driven and so forth. I think we also have to remember that Q2 was relatively better compared to previous trends. So we saw a difference. The most significant in a sense is the change in trajectory within the quarter that was quite significant. What exactly drove the change in trajectory was -- there's 2 aspects. One is it was broad based, but then there's some product-specific elements. I think it's a widespread elements that's widely known is the decline -- the sharp declines of tablets. It is -- this is a category in which we have a very large market share, of course, so it impacts us. But from an industry standpoint, there was a significant decline in that. Now since then, there's been new product introductions that we can all be very familiar with. Does the weather plays a role. I think the apparel players would have spoken about this. Our science is not sophisticated enough. The people, in particular in Minnesota, like to go to their lake rather than shopping. It's not -- don't think so, okay? So that's the color I would give. Looking ahead, again to the extent that there is amazing great products and so forth, number one, it can help the industry, and certainly will help us, and we will take advantage of it. I would like to ask you, David, to repeat your question around service, because I'm not sure I fully understand it. Do you mind repeating it? Because I want to do a great job of answering your question. David Magee : Sure, Hubert. My second question has to do with just the price investments you're making on service, and I know that's a big part of the future there in terms of developing that business further. I'm curious what the plans would be in terms of getting consumers aware of Geek Squad and, perhaps, a lower pricing, and just improving that awareness? Hubert Joly : Yes, thank you for that question. So let's clarify first what we've done, what the impact is and what we have still ahead of us around that. So what we've done is we've redefined the service offering with the Geek Squad services for computing and tablet. We launched that on September 13 with Geek Squad Protect and Support Plus. And we also launched AppleCare with ramping up our Apple service provider capabilities. So we've changed the offering, moving away from pure warranties to something that is helpful to customers, and we've materially lowered the price. I think that this is something -- we've been consistent in wanting to be price competitive. Our field, our stores are very excited about this. The service offering is very good. We've seen initial pickup in the attach rates. We're very excited about that. We also know that perceptions change slowly, and like our previous investments, we do expect that it's going to take time before it pickups fully. We don't expect in this category to completely offset -- to have the elasticity completely offset the price investments, but we do expect to make progress. But the actions we're taking to help the customers be aware of that is the training and the proficiency of our Blue Shirts and of course the Geek Squad agents. We're also investing on the site. And I think that in the quarters ahead, we'll see continued progress. More broadly -- because this is just one small first step in our Services strategy. And if you step back, what we've said is that Services is actually playing -- will play a bigger role than just being a revenue and profit center. Services for us can be a part of the value proposition. So if you're going to buy a big TV, if it's going to be above 55 or 60 inches, you want somebody to deliver it and install it for you and do it really well. And of course, we have unique capabilities. We also see Services being a growth driver. So when we have somebody coming to your house, who understand your needs and build a solution for you, we're not going to charge for the in-home visit, but this is -- this has the ability to drive business, and we see it today with our Magnolia Design Centers and there's more where it's coming from. And then as we continue to innovate our Services and evolve the positioning of the brand, you're going to see it appear more and more in our various marketing vehicles. It's true today a little bit on the site. It's truing the circular in our -- in the stores. With everything we've done, and that's going to be consistent in the last 3 years of our transformation, it's gradual and incremental. We've started that journey, and you're going to see us continue moving forward in that direction. So more to come. Operator : We'll go to our last question from Greg Melich. Gregory Melich : I have 2 questions. Hopefully, one is more for Sharon and other one more for Hubert. Sharon, I want to understand the gross margin impact that you were calling out on Services pricing, and how we should think about it vis-\u00e0-vis the periodic profit share. If I got this right, that goes from 20 bps in the third quarter to 50 bps in the fourth quarter of help. And we should think of Services as like a 20, 25 bp offset, the pricing. Is that -- am I thinking about that right? Sharon McCollam : Yes, that's right. Just when you take a look at Q4, Greg, let me try to reconcile it for you. Last year, in Q4, we earned $1.48. The Canadian brand consolidation is costing us about $0.06 to $0.08. And then in addition to that, the tax rate last year at 34.5%, going up to the current rate, is going to cost us about $0.05 to $0.06. So on a -- if you just go back and you take those up against last year, that really puts last year's EPS at about $1.35 on a comparable basis to what we have this year. Then when you go into the outlook I gave you, we talked about the fact that we've got the 25 basis point investment in Services pricing. So that's going to come off the gross profit, right? We have the higher distribution costs associated with growth in the online channel and then the appliance and large-screen TV -- large cube costs will hit us in Q4. Of course, we're going to have the revenue as well. And then there's some product mix issues that are -- we're expecting to hit us in Q4. And then all of those downsides will be offset by the 50 basis point -- it's actually 55 basis point profit-sharing benefit. So when you're really thinking about this outlook, when you get down to the EPS range that you get when you take the Enterprise level reduction on the OI rate, quite frankly, it is not look -- it's starting to look a lot like last year and, maybe, even on the high end a little bit better. Gregory Melich : And the 55, how much of that is catch-up? And effectively, where at the end of this year you're truing up that there's just -- the warranties just aren't costing as much. Or is it just an ongoing type number? Sharon McCollam : Yes. So it is always -- the way this periodic payment works, it is always a settling up of prior reserves, and the settlement is usually only done once a year. If you go back in history, some years, we had one, some years, we didn't, but we have made such substantial changes in the program. Best Buy has taken action. We put deductibles in on the phone repair, which we were the only ones in the industry, historically, that didn't have one. You'll recall that. We had some plans that were multiyear plans. We have had repair reductions, where we're doing the repairs. We're sourcing parts differently. There are all kinds of changes that we have made in the last couple of years, Greg, that operationally are driving this. In addition, at the same time, that we were making operational improvements around the fulfillment of claims associated with the extended warranties, from an industry point of view, and this is really a quality -- vendor quality point of view. The devices have been extremely durable, and we have not seen the frequency of claims. So the combination of those are driving that. Now I can tell you that in fiscal '17 in the prepared remarks, we said we do not know what this will be, and we do not believe it'll be as high as it is this year. There will be next year; it will come in Q4. There will be some level, our gut tells us. You never know for sure, but we believe there will be a periodic payment next year. This year, I think it is -- we think it is unusually high. In addition, there's the premium to be paid. Every time we sell a new warranty, there will be premiums that we pay to the insurer to take on that liability. And because of these factors, our premiums went down in the back half of this year. They will continue into next year and then on top of that, we will see another likely premium assessment downward next year. So that -- we can talk more about it in the one-on-one call, if you'd like further color, so that I can get to your second question, but... Gregory Melich : That's very helpful. I did want to ask a bigger-picture one that I think is important. I think, Hubert, in your prepared comments, you mentioned all the store-within-a-store programs, the Samsung Open Houses, the new Apple stores. Could you give us some metrics as to how that's really helping drive the business and bigger ASPs and conversion? If you think about it over the last 2 or 3 years, have we moved from 10% to 25% of sales that are store-within-a-store or one of these type programs? Or how can we kind of frame that? Or how do you think about it? Hubert Joly : Yes, thank you for your question. It's been such an important part of our journey. For me, the most important driver or impact of the stores-within-a-store has manifested itself in our market share gains. The customer experience we provide is massively better and improved. The experience of the customers has changed dramatically. And so we're seeing more expertise, better experience resulting in market share gains. And we see that in all of the categories, and clearly, the vendors see that as well because they've continued to look at that. Now it's an ongoing process. Looking ahead, we want to make sure that a key factor for our profitability is profit per square feet -- per square foot. And so as we look ahead with our various vendors in the various parts of our stores, we'll want to continue to optimize that, so that we win with the customers, something we want to win for our vendors, but we also want to win for us and drive -- continue to drive great outcomes. When you are in our stores -- and of course, every store is different, but there are some stores where these stores-within-a-store with the addition of the Pacific Kitchen & Home, and Magnolia Design Centers today occupy a large part of the stores. So they're a big part of our winning with customers. So in summary, we feel a great quarter in Q3, we -- the combination of online revenue growth and margin expansion in Q3 in the environment that we're all familiar with is the great outcome. Hopefully, you felt our excitement for Q4. Hopefully, you felt that we try to provide as much color as possible on the outlook, and we'll see you either in stores or online. Remember to shake your phone with the app to get access to our agents and Blue Shirt. And thank you for your continued support in the company. Have a great day, great holiday, everyone. Operator : That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available approximately by 11 :00 a.m. Eastern Time today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien - Vice President, Investor Relations : Good morning, and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning. Today's release and conference call both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, which should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful, can be found in this morning's earnings release. Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial conditions, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release, SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. In today's earnings release and conference call we refer to consumer electronics industry trends. The consumer electronics industry, as defined and tracked by the NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets, not including Kindle, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 65% of our Domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, appliances, services, gaming, Apple Watch, movies and music. Final housekeeping item before I turn the call over to Hubert, beginning in January fiscal 2017 we will no longer issue an interim holiday press release due to the increasing significance of the month of January for overall fourth quarter financial results. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with a real fourth quarter and annual performance and then provide an overview of the next phase of our Renew Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. From a financial perspective, in the fourth quarter we delivered Enterprise revenue of $13.62 billion, improved our non-GAAP operating rate by 10 basis points to 5.9% and delivered a better than expected non-GAAP EPS of $1.53 versus $1.48 last year. In our Domestic business, we exceeded our bottom line expectations due to a well executed holiday plan, a disciplined promotional strategy, better recovery on returns and clearance products and strong expense management. While Domestic revenue declined 1.5%, it was against a backdrop where the NPD-reported categories were down 5.1%. Strong performance in health & wearables, home theater and appliances was more than offset by softness in the mobile phone category and continued declines in tablets. In addition, we continued to drive significant growth in the online channel with e-commerce revenue increasing nearly 14% to 15.6% of total Domestic revenue. In the International business, our performance was better than expected on the top and bottom lines. While revenue declined 26.2% due to the expected impacts of foreign currency and store closures in Canada, revenue retention from the brand consolidation continued to exceed our expectations. This high retention in addition to a more effective promotional strategy drove a 30 basis point increase in the International non-GAAP operating income rate to 4.7%. On a full-year basis, fiscal 2016 marks the second year in a row we increased our Domestic revenue and expanded our operating margin. We also continued to make significant progress against our Renew Blue strategy. So during the year, we continued to gain share in appliances in nearly all of our traditional consumer-electronics categories, we grew Domestic online revenue 13% to over $4 billion or 11% of total Domestic revenue. We increased our Net Promoter Score by over 300 basis points. We continued to improve our employee engagement scores and decreased employee turnover. We deepened our partnerships with the top tech companies in the world. We delivered $150 million against our $400 million Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization programs. We consolidated brands and embarked on a significant transformation in Canada including the closure of 68 stores. And finally, in one year we returned $1.5 billion in cash to shareholders including $1 billion in share repurchases, which was originally planned to be completed over three years. This performance is the direct result of the execution of our Renew Blue strategy and the hard work, dedication and customer focus on the part of all of our associates. I am proud to recognize them publicly this morning. Turning to fiscal 2017, we are entering the next phase of our Renew Blue strategy. Our purpose, from the customer's standpoint, is to build a company that does a unique job of helping customers learn about and enjoy the latest technologies. As we begin this next phase, in fiscal 2017 we will execute against the following priorities. Number one, build on our strong industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business; number two, drive cost reduction and efficiencies; and number three, advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. So our first priority is to build on our strong industry position and multichannel capabilities to drive the existing business. More specifically, we will implement a number of initiatives across merchandising, marketing, digital, stores, services and supply chain. For example, in home theater, we will build on the superior customer experience we've created in partnership with our key vendors and leverage the strength of our market-leading share in 4K and large-screen televisions. We will also add five Magnolia Design Center stores within a store, bringing our total to 84 by year-end. In appliances, we expect to continue to grow our market share by adding an incremental 27 Pacific Kitchen & Home stores within a store bringing our total to 203 at year-end, and by leveraging the new vendor appliance experiences that were launched in Q3 of last year. Additionally, we expect to see incremental growth from our enhanced delivery and installation offerings which are driving higher conversion and material improvements in NPS, Net Promoter Score. In connected home, we will continue to increase our assortment in emerging categories including security, lighting and video monitoring, expand our in-store presentation and leverage our leading position in routers and networking equipment, which form the backbone of the connected home. In mobile phones, we will capitalize on the customer experience investments we implemented late last year, with an expectation to drive increased conversion as well as reduced wait time for our customers. Our strategy is to be an advocate for every phone order by offering the best deal on plans and devices, impartial advice and clarity and efficiency in what can be a complex process. In the very short term we believe high smartphone penetration combined with low consumer demand for current product offerings is depressing the category. Over the course of the year, we believe that more compelling phone launches can fuel renewed growth in the category. From an online standpoint, we will continue to build out new digital capabilities, prioritizing the customer shopping experience on phone and tablet devices. Examples of recent advances include the successful Q4 launch of BlueAssist which allows customers to simply shake their device to get live help with products and orders through chat, call and email. Another example is Touch ID login, including our latest mobile app updates and of course, our recently launched Geek Squad app. In our retail stores, we will continue to drive increased sales proficiency and further leverage our service capabilities. In fiscal 2016, our Blue Shirts and Geek Squad Agents contributed significantly to our NPS and market share gains and we believe there continues to be significant further opportunity to take this competitive advantage to the next level. And then finally, in our International business we remain focused on our Canadian transformation, we will continue to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance. Our second priority for fiscal 2017 is to reduce cost and drive efficiencies throughout the business. Reducing cost is essential for us to be able to fund our investment, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. Furthermore, based on current economic factors and softness in the consumer electronics industry, it is essential that we be proactive on the cost reduction front. The key elements of our approach to achieving this is to simplify our business processes to simultaneously improve the customer experience and drive cost out. As an example, we have a project focused on reducing the amount of open box appliances we take into our stores by addressing root cause issues. This project has the potential to not only improve the customer experience, but also to drive material savings through lower markdowns, lower transportation cost and better use of labor in our stores and distribution centers. More broadly, we aspire to achieve world-class operational levels of performance defined in terms of quality, service and cost. This focus has to be a way of life, especially given our margin structure and the volatility of our industry. Last year, we announced a specific cost reduction and gross profit optimization program called Renew Blue Phase 2 with a goal of $400 million over three years on top of the $1 billion we eliminate as part of Phase 1. Against that goal, in fiscal 2016 we achieved $150 million, leaving us with $250 million. In light of our increased focus on cost and productivity, we believe there are incremental savings that can be achieved above and beyond our current goal which we will update you on as we progress. Partially offsetting these savings will be our expected future investments in the areas of labor expertise, services pricing and key growth initiatives which I will discuss in a moment. In fiscal 2016, these investments totaled approximately $100 million and we expect a similar level in fiscal 2017 which, to be clear, will be funded by our cost savings. Our third priority is to advance key initiatives to more deeply transform Best Buy in order to drive future growth and differentiation. While there may be short-term pressures, we continue to believe we operate in an opportunity-rich environment, the advent of the Internet of Things is providing a new technology way that is making Best Buy's operating model increasingly relevant to customers. We are investing to be the leading technology expert, who makes it easy to learn about and confidently enjoy the best tech. In this context, we believe we have ongoing growth opportunities around key product categories as well as from increasing share of wallet with existing customers and acquiring new customers within our target segments who are those of us passionate about technology and need help with it. Capturing these opportunities will require that we do the following : Number one, develop and bring to market curated, solution driven merchandise to solve key customer problems, in particular in new growth areas. Number two, ensure we have an inspirational and educational sales approach across all sales channels that helps customers understand the value that technology can create for them. Number three, help customers unleash what's possible from their technologies and number four, provide customers with ongoing convenient post purchase support. Inherent in all of this is the desire to build a stronger ongoing relationship with our customers. Now, our services capabilities and Geek Squad are key building blocks of this strategy. We understand that we've discussed service related opportunities many times in the past. And while it is not visible in our services top-line results today, we are in fact making progress to bring these opportunities to life. To do so, we've had to spend time in the last two years fixing many aspects of our traditional warranty and repair businesses. We've also had to adjust our pricing in warranty business. We are seeing the results of our efforts through substantial increases in Net Promoter Scores, higher total customer interactions, and from a financial point of view, the periodic profit sharing payments we earned this year. We are also beginning to see improved attach rates as we enter fiscal 2017. Building on this, we will continue our work to improve the customer experience and enhance our service offering and capabilities in support of our mission to help customers learn about and enjoy the latest tech. While we are energized by the potential of this opportunity, the work necessary to capture takes time. Thus fiscal 2017 will be another year of gradual and incremental improvement with more meaningful results expected in fiscal 2018. Now, before I turn the call over to Sharon, I'd like to provide some thoughts about our fiscal 2017 outlook and return of capital plan. So in summary, Best Buy is a specialty retailer that excels in an industry characterized by product innovation cycles. We are undeterred by this fact as we believe there will always be technology innovation. And our imperative is that in these cycles, we continue to deliver superior execution against what is in our control, recognizing that the cycles rarely align at any point in time. In fiscal 2017, we are focused on continuing to build on our foundation to both drive and capitalize on these technology cycles. And further, we are focused on building the key initiatives that we discussed today that we believe will result in stickier relationship with our customers, provide profitable revenue even during down cycles and continue to create long term shareholder value. Over time, as the fruit of these key initiatives materialize, we expect to accelerate our revenue and operating income growth by taking advantage of opportunities provided by ongoing technology innovation and the need customers have for help. In the short term, we will be characterized by our strong cash flow generating capabilities and our intent to regularly return excess free cash flow to shareholders. From a financial outlook perspective for fiscal 2017, based on current industry dynamics and how we see the various product cycles playing out in our Domestic business, we are expecting revenue declines in the first half followed by growth in the back half. We also expect that our strong execution and operational capabilities will allow us to continue to gain market share. In this context, we are targeting flat Domestic revenue for the full year due to continued growth in appliances, connected home and home theater in particular, but recognize that being flat will be challenging without a strong mobile cycle and improvements in the NPD-reported categories overall. Despite the soft top-line environment, we will target flattish operating income including the lapping of the significant periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016. A key element to achieve this will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. In addition, we intend to reward our shareholders by being a premium dividend payer and increasing our earnings per share through ongoing share repurchases. I would now like to talk about our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan. After three consecutive years of strong cash flow generation and the Renew Blue, we believe that now is an ideal time to provide a view of our long-term capital allocation strategy. This strategy is based on our strong cash position today and our ongoing confidence in our future cash flow generation. At the core of this strategy is our intent to first fund our operations and gross investments including potential acquisitions and then to return the remaining excess free cash flow to our shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. This strategy targets the return of excess free cash flow to shareholders through a 35% to 45% non-GAAP dividend payout ratio and regular share repurchases with a minimum annual expectation of offsetting dilution from equity compensation. So in line with this strategy, our fiscal 2017 return of capital plan includes, number one, a 22% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share. Number two, the intent to repurchase $1 billion worth of shares over the next two years. And number three, a special dividend of $0.45 per share or approximately $145 million. This is in addition to the $1.5 billion in cash we returned to shareholders in fiscal 2016. I will now turn the call over to Sharon to discuss the details of our fourth quarter financials and our Q1 fiscal 2017 guidance. Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you in our holiday sales release. Enterprise revenue of $13.6 billion was in line with expectations. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.9%, however, exceeded our expectations due to better-than-expected profitability in both our Domestic and International businesses driven by a more effective, disciplined promotional strategy, better recovery on returned and clearance products and an approximate $0.02 of additional EPS from the periodic profit sharing benefit from our externally-managed extended service plan portfolio. Additionally, our non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 34% resulting in an incremental $0.02 of EPS versus expectations. I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue declined 4.1% to $13.6 billion primarily due to a 1.8% comparable sales decline in the Domestic business, a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 140 basis points, and the negative impact of Canadian store closures. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.05 or 3% to $1.53. This increase was primarily driven by the service periodic profit-sharing benefit of $0.19 and a share repurchase benefit of $0.06. These benefits were partially offset by Domestic revenue declines in the mobile phone, tablet and digital imaging categories and the expected $0.03 negative impact from the Canadian brand consolidation. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 1.5% to $12.5 billion this decline was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.8%, excluding the estimated 10 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and the loss of revenue from 13 large-format and 17 small-format Best Buy mobile store closures. These declines were partially offset by the 10 basis point benefit associated with installment billing and the approximate 80 basis point services periodic profit-sharing benefit, which is not included in our comparable sales calculation. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health & wearables, home theater and major appliances was more than offset by significant declines in mobile phones, tablets, digital imaging and services. In services, comparable revenue declined 11.9% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue driven by lower frequency and severity of claims on extended warranties. In our International segment, revenue declined 26.2% to $1.1 billion, due to a negative foreign currency impact of approximately 1,350 basis points, the loss of revenue associated with closed stores as part of the Canadian brand consolidation and ongoing softness in the Canadian economy and consumer electronics industry. Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 21.6%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 21.6%. This increase was primarily due to a 65 basis point impact from the services periodic profit-sharing benefit and improved rates in the mobile and computing categories, primarily due to a more disciplined promotional strategy. These increases were partially offset by an increased mix of lower margin wearable devices, a decreased mix of higher-margin digital imaging products, a lower rate in televisions driven by a decline in average selling prices and higher distribution costs, and our investments in services pricing. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 21.8%. This increase was primarily driven by higher year-over-year gross profit rate in both Canada and Mexico, due to a more disciplined promotional strategy. Now, turning to SG&A, Enterprise-level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.1 billion or 15.7% of revenue, a decrease of $68 million, but an increase of 20 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.95 billion or 15.6% of revenue, and was nearly flat in dollars year-over-year as investments in future growth initiatives and lower vendor funding being recorded as an offset to SG&A were offset by the flow of Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reductions and lower incentive compensation. From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 30 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was $192 million or 17.2% of revenue, a decrease of $70 million or 10 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. Specific to the Canadian brand consolidation, we incurred non-GAAP diluted EPS impact of negative $0.03 in the fourth quarter and negative $0.07 for fiscal 2016. These impacts were lower than expected due to higher sales retention from closed stores, a more disciplined promotional strategy and our decision to transform only a limited number of stores this year in order to pilot results. In Q1 of fiscal 2017, Canada will still be lapping 68 of its store closures last year and facing ongoing foreign-currency and Canadian economic headwinds. As such, in Q1, we expect International revenue to decline 15% to 20%. Beginning in the second quarter, and through the balance of the year, while currency and economic headwinds will continue to be a challenge, in constant currency, the International business is expected to be near flat on both the top and bottom line. From a cash flow perspective, on a full year basis, capital expenditures totaled $649 million and we returned $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders. In working capital, our decision to bring holiday inventory in early as well as the Super Bowl moving into Q1 fiscal 2017 resulted in us holding inventory longer and having to settle accounts payable prior to year-end. This created a timing issue which resulted in our ratio of accounts payable to inventory being lower at year-end than last year. As we look forward to next year, capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $650 million to $700 million and the accounts payable to inventory ratio is expected to increase. I would now like to talk about our Q1 financial guidance. In the Domestic business, we believe that the softness that we saw in the NPD-tracked categories and mobile phones will continue into Q1. We also believe that in the International business revenue will be down the approximate 15% to 20% due to the ongoing impacts of foreign currency and the Canadian brand consolidation, which was not executed until late March of 2015. With that backdrop, we are expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.25 billion to $8.35 billion and Enterprise comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to negative 2%, primarily driven by continued softness in the mobile and tablet categories. Our non-GAAP effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 39% to 39.5% and our Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.31 to $0.35, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 326 million. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you We'll first go to Kate McShane with Citi. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): My questions today focus on the return of capital plan that you outlined, just two questions around that. One, can you explain to us the thinking behind the special dividend versus just increasing the regular dividend or doing more share buyback with that cash? And could you remind us how you are thinking about possible acquisitions and how that can enhance Best Buy over the long term? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Absolutely, Kate. On the special dividend, very similar to last year, we had these legal settlements that are \u2013 from prior years and they're substantial, you see them when you look at the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. And last year, we returned that through the special dividend to our shareholders. In addition to that we had asset disposals, one was the sale of Europe last year and then we had some small entities that we sold this year, and as those were assets that were part of the existing core base of our business, we think giving that cash back to our existing shareholders makes sense and it's an elegant way to get cash back to our shareholders. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : And Kate to your question about acquisitions, we do mention acquisitions in the press release and I mentioned them in my prepared remarks, so in answer to your question, the framework is as follows, we have a clear mission which is to do this unique job of helping customers learn about and enjoy technology. Acquisitions would be helpful inasmuch as they bring us capabilities to accelerate our transformation in this direction, that's the first criteria. And of course, the second important criteria, as you would appreciate, is that they'd be financially accretive over time. So that's the backdrop of that nothing eminent, but we thought it was appropriate to share that with you this morning. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Next we will go to Dan Binder with Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : Thank you. From an execution standpoint, it seems that you're doing everything you should and you don't have a lot of control over these cycles, but I did want to focus a little bit on the cycles for a minute and get your view on things like virtual reality, what's in the pipe for mobile that you think is going to turn that business around? Can we get another year out of TV and where do you think connected home starts to hit a sweet spot? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. So talking about the future in this industry is always interesting. Let me try to be as helpful as possible. As we look ahead, in particular, fiscal 2017, the areas where we see key growth opportunities for us, around appliances where we, as you know, we had multiple quarters, multiple years now of growth and that's going to continue to be driven by the housing recovery. Second is connected objects, so one of the connect \u2013 the Internet of Things, connected home and then of course there is the continued TV cycle. The specific categories you talk about, so in particular order, virtual reality, we're very excited, we have this promotion if anybody is interested in buying the Galaxy S7. You can preorder now at Best Buy and you get a free virtual-reality gear and then some additional memory, so great value. Clearly (31:45), this is an interesting category. I think it will still be small this year. It may help in the computing category with higher-end computers because you're going to need that computing power, but from a financial standpoint, it's going to be limited. Mobile, I think I'm going to stick to my prepared remarks. It's going to be a function of new products, revising the category. And I'm not going to make any forward-looking statement on that particular point. TVs, of course, we've been very excited and performing really well with 4K and large screen TVs. Our share has been increasing. Of course, like any cycle, this is not going to continue forever, so it's not going to be as strong going forward as it has been from a growth rate standpoint. Connected home, I think, is an exciting category. Increasingly, it's not just about the security cameras or the smart locks and so forth. Everything in your home is connected, at least in my home. Your smart TVs is connected, your music, your streaming, your home office is connected, gaming is connected, and of course getting into security, home automation, energy management. And the complexity of this, think about this with the control layer, the security layer, the net working layer, the access layer provides a lot of complexity. And so the continued innovation and the complexity creates a big opportunity for us. So we're seeing growth. I've made comments about the fact that we are increasing the assortments, the presentation. And we are building on our strengths in routers and networking. So we'll see continued growth in that growth space of connected objects and the Internet of Things. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : And, Sharon, if I could just one follow up on Canada. I think you said operating income flat year-over-year. With the expenses related to the store closings, I thought there was supposed to be a year-over-year swing this year that would be positive. I was wondering if you could just add a little color to that flat operating profit outlook? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Absolutely. First, there's two things. One is the impact of foreign currency which has been substantial. Remember that that averages into the cost of inventory over time. And as that has been prolonged, that will affect them from a gross profit standpoint. In addition to that, the Canadian economy also has been pretty soft, and we are playing that into our outlook and making sure that we've accounted for what we think is happening there right now. But we could not be more pleased with the consolidation, the retention rate, the execution that has happened up there. Also lastly, there will also be some additional investments next year, but remember, we're saying we're offsetting our investments as a company. But there will be some investments in these new pilot stores that we are working on. And there's disruption when we're approaching that. So that will be another aspect of it. We're not going to be announcing every quarter a impact of the Canadian brand consolidation and the stores. We're going to treat it pretty much as business as usual. But there is significant investment and it is why the CapEx next year is going up just slightly because that will be higher in Canada. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. Two questions, one just on the cost savings versus offset. So you saved about $150 million this year. Did you tell us what the investments were? And then what I'm getting at is then over the next two years, you've quantified $250 million in savings, but $200 million in offsets. So over the course of the three years, that $400 million in savings, how much of that should we expect to flow to the bottom line? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : So Mike, thank you for your question. An important consideration thinking about fiscal 2017 is the fact we are lapping the periodic payment related to our service portfolio. So that's a meaningful thing. So achieving flattish operating income rate domestically is made possible by these cost savings and this renewed focus. But the general principle, is we are offsetting all of our investments with cost savings and then we are able to lap this periodic payment. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. So sort of a net neutral over the three years, it sounds like? If I could ask one more question, just in terms of your stores in the U.S., it looks like you closed about 10 of the big box stores in the U.S., I think about 10 in the quarter, 13 for the year. How should we think about that going forward? I know you don't announce store closures specifically, but should we expect that to continue to come down? And as part of that question, what do the leases look like in terms of expiration? I think 2016 was a heavy year for expirations, can you confirm that? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Yes, every year here on out is a big year for expirations. We have well over 100 expirations coming into fiscal 2016. And Michael, we will continue to do what we have been doing, which is methodically rationalize the real estate portfolio. The diligence around the renewals is substantial, if we are renewing. Also you can see it in the lease disclosure every year that the term that we're committing to with these leases is shorter, and we will continue to do that to maintain flexibility in the portfolio. But rest assured that we will continue to rationalize as we deem it appropriate. The great news is that the stores that remain in our portfolio, they are performing. The key for us is improving and increasing our retention rates in the U.S. Unlike Canada where the stores were literally in the same parking lot, a mile away, 3 miles away, in the U.S. we never built our portfolio that way. So you can't immediately extract these really strong results from Canada and assume that if we did that in the U.S. it would look exactly the same. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So what are the expected transfer rates in the U.S. or the experience in the 13 or so stores you closed this year? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : We haven't given that publicly and we don't know yet, obviously, because many of those stores closed October 1, so you won't know until you've cycled the full year. And we don't actually have, as you know over the last several years we closed about 49 stores, prior to Hubert and I joining the company and we've only had a small number of stores since that time that have actually closed. So from a retention point of view, we're looking at something in the low to mid-30%s and in some of these stores you would need higher retention rates than that in order to justify the store closures. Michael Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the color. Operator : Now we will go to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. First on a follow up on the Super Bowl shift, in retrospect now that you've lapped it, can you talk about how much the Super Bowl hurt the fourth-quarter comps and what the lateral benefit is expected to the first quarter? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Chris, we quantified the impact of the Super Bowl and obviously, the Super Bowl did move. The one thing to keep in mind, just about February, is we had substantial store closures this year as a result of the weather situation, so that put a little bit of an offset to that. But we were very \u2013 we gave you the estimate and we continue to believe that that is what it played out to be. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Understood. And follow up on the prior question about the cycles in the back half outlook, how are you thinking about TV, the TV category as the year progresses from the sales and gross profit dollar perspective? And are you expecting tablets to see any sort of a rebound in the back half as you think about the revenue recovery in the back half? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Chris, good morning. The further out you go and the more specific the questions are, the harder it is to predict. I shared in my prepared remarks our view that in aggregate for the year, we can be flattish from a top and bottom-line standpoint, in the U.S., there's going to be a lot of moving pieces. TVs, the cycle has been very strong, we've performed extremely well. We expect to continue to perform and do a great job for our customers. We don't expect the growth rates to remain the same, so this is going to slow down. Tablets, I think it's anybody's guess. I think one of the vendors has made forward-looking comments about tablets, I don't know that I have anything to add to this. So we thought it was helpful and this is the first time we're actually doing this to provide a full year perspective, so taking a bit of a risk here and it's a portfolio view right, and then things will move within that. That's probably the best I can tell you this morning. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : We'll now go to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning. First, you're targeting flattish operating income next year, you mentioned the CapEx a little bit elevated, is the flattish operating income, notwithstanding that CapEx, is that a reasonable proxy for direction of free cash or are there other items on working capital that will go in your favor? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : I believe that from a working capital point of view, as I mentioned, this accounts payable to inventory ratio this year was extremely low because of the decisions and the shift of the Super Bowl. Now, next year the Super Bowl will continue to be around the same time, but obviously we'll be lapping that so that won't change, but on the other side of our business we do expect to be increasing that accounts payable to inventory ratio by year-end. So I expect to see a little bit of benefit coming from that. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then a follow up on the services investment, can you tell us how much of the sales pressure is now self-induced because of lower prices versus the change in units or attach rate? And can you remind us, is there any additional benefit from the profit sharing in 2016? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yes. So several questions, the services revenue decline, there's a piece which we've called nonproductive revenue which is driven by the lower frequency and cost severity related to the claims. As it relates to the productive revenue which is the one that we care about, the trend is starting to evolve because we have the price investment and we have quantified it for you in Q4, and that's going to, of course, carry over into this fiscal year and it is partially offset by the \u2013 we're seeing the beginning of an increase in the attach rate. We never expected the attach rates to fully offset the price investment. This is an area frankly where the elasticity is much lower than on the key hardware categories, but we thought it was the right thing to do from a customer standpoint as we looked ahead. As it relates to the periodic payment from the warranty portfolio, last year was an exceptional year. And we've disclosed every quarter the amounts. It was driven by, again, the improved performance of our service portfolio, so nothing to be shy about around that. But this was an exceptional year because it was multiple \u2013 it was twice the amount. Now, looking ahead in this fiscal year, we'll get some continued improvement in that business as the improved operational performance, severity and frequency will carry over not so much in the form of periodic payment, but in the form of lower cost charged to the portfolio. Not nearly close to the amount of fiscal 2016, but some portion. Now, what's exciting for us is that we get to lap the partly exceptional payment last year and we're able to do this through the increased focus on cost and efficiency. Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : And Simeon, I'll just add that Hubert also, in his prepared remarks, mentioned that as we got towards the Q4, the pricing was in place, et cetera, we did start seeing some uptick in our attach rates in the services business, which was the foundation of the investment in the services pricing and the launch of AppleCare, et cetera. So on that side of it, we are pleased with how that is playing out for us from a strategic point of view. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. Good luck. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I think, one of the things you talked about as a benefit for this past holiday season was the expectation for improved in-stock levels given the prior year's launch of ship from store. Can you help quantify what the comp impact was that you think you experienced from the improved inventory levels? And related to that, are there opportunities to further improve in stock or are you where you want to be at this stage? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : Thanks for the questions, Scot. Yes, there is no question that we improved our in stock levels, and what is terrific is that our customers noticed it. This was an area where we received recognition in our Net Promoter Score from our customers. Now, in order to do that, you heard me just mention this accounts payable to inventory ratio. We did bring our inventories in earlier and customers are shopping earlier and earlier, so that in retrospect has turned out to be an excellent decision for us. In addition to that, we have had a significant focus on restocking in our stores and have made some operational changes in our stores for down stocking. That also paid dividends to us during the fourth quarter. In addition, on ship from store, we continue to believe that strategically ship from store will go down in our history at Best Buy as one of the most important and strategic decisions that we made because it is allowing us to utilize both our online and our retail inventories to serve the online customer. And it has obviously \u2013 you've seen the strength of our online growth, that business now is over $4 billion. And what ship from store is allowing us to do is be able to on a consistent basis make marketing promises to customers about speed of delivery. So to your question on, we said we were going to do this, was there a positive outcome \u2013 clearly there was a balance sheet investment as it related to that accounts payable to inventory ratio. The answer is yes, we did it, it worked and we're very pleased with it and we will continue to make additional changes where we believe it's necessary, but Hubert and I in no way believe that we have solved our in-stock issue. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, in my prepared remarks more broadly, going beyond (48:40) inventory and in stock, we believe that operationally, from sales proficiency in particular, we have the opportunity to continue to drive increased performance in our stores and, of course, in our online channel as well, we are not finished. That's really \u2013 fits with the first priority I laid out, we have multiple opportunities there, we are very clear about them. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I think that all makes sense? Is there any way to quantify what the comp impact was, Sharon? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : That is really difficult to do, particularly at retail. If I could get that exact number, I would love to have it too Scot, but it's really difficult to calculate, so no, I'm not ready to put a number out there to say it drove x basis points of comp, but what I can tell you is that conversion both in the retail stores and in the online channel was a driver. We had the softness in mobile and we know that, but we would've been positive without that. And conversion was a significant contributor to those results and obviously, that is one of the hardest things to move and we feel very good about how we've driven the business. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got you. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : And now we will go to Joseph Feldman with Telsey Group. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask something a little broader maybe about the consumer. And just kind of what you're seeing from the consumer, or from your market research and studies and surveys of the consumer. Are you seeing any changes, I guess, within categories of what consumers are buying? Is there any change in appetite for services? I mean, I know what the service sales rates are, but I guess I'm trying to get at, like has there been a demand change, more broadly speaking, and within economic, kind of, classification like high or low income? Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, the U.S. consumer, we could spend the next 30 minutes on that. We are pleased with the mind and the spirit of the U.S. consumer, certainly compared to many other geographies outside of the U.S. Demand is there, you see it when you see the growth in appliances, continued growth in appliances, that is a very strong wave. In our category, I think we all have to bear in mind that demand is driven by supply, so when there's great, exciting innovation you get that. Because most of what we sell is not the basic Maslovian need on the part of our customer. So this is an industry where great supply creates demand, and we're excited about the technology waves that are coming above and beyond the softness that has existed in phones. From a services standpoint, I would say two things. One is, there's clear demand for help on the part of the customer. Now, the customer, all of us don't always want to pay for service and we will provide and we're providing service today in order to generate more demand, so when we have Magnolia system designers coming to your home that's going to generate demand, but their visit is free and we're happy to come to your home, everybody on the call, we'll come to you. Tech support, however, above and beyond the self-help is something that customers are happy to pay for and we are seeing increased demand in this area. So the summary is that we believe we have an opportunity-rich environment and that the key trends are made for Best Buy, based on these technology waves and the need that customers have for help. Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : And Joe, I'll just add that from a metric point of view, what can you see, the average order value at Best Buy, again when you look at what contributed to the outcome of Q4, we saw that again increased. So, again, the high-end consumer, I believe there is a lot of noise around the high-end consumer which we of course cater to here at Best Buy and the data that's what the metrics would tell you about that consumer, obviously conversion was up and average order value, both retail and online. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : That's great. Thanks guys, and I'll let somebody else go next. Thanks. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with BB&T Capital Markets. Anthony Chinonye Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just circle back on the shop-in-shops, obviously you've had some of those for quite some time now and so I wanted to get an update just in terms of how they're performing versus the rest of the house? And then just any indication if you think that there might be additional shop-in-shops to come? Thank you Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning Anthony. The shop-in-shop with the \u2013 so there's two types of shop-in-shop, there's the vendors, the vendor's shop-in-shop and then there's the Magnolia Design Centers and Pacific. In general, these enhanced customer experiences have been a key element of our transformation because it has allowed us to renovate our stores, increase the customer experience, provide more expertise to our customers. And we're very excited about this. Increasingly, it's difficult to measure because as many of you visit our stores, the shop-in-shop are in many, many of our stores, so it's really hard to measure scientifically with great precision, however, when you see increased market share there is no doubt and as an example, increased market share in 4K, in high-end TVs or in appliances, there's no doubt that this has been a key driver of our performance. Looking ahead, there's no doubt that in terms of physical shop-in-shop, there's less to be done, right because we have high penetration of these shop-in-shops. So I think that looking ahead, we have the opportunity to partner, in some cases, more deeply with the vendors, in particular, in how we deliver this promise of making it easy to learn about and enjoy the technologies. So around help and service and classes, I think there is a deeper integration opportunities with the vendors and we're excited about that as well. Anthony Chinonye Chukumba - BB&T Capital Markets : That's helpful. Thank you. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : And our final question will come from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was wondering if you could help us understand the complexion of that remaining $250 million of Renew Blue savings that you are attacking? And I realize it's early, but any examples of the incremental opportunities that you alluded to earlier and the timing of that? Sharon L. McCollam - Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer : From a identification standpoint, we have a robust list of actions that we are going against. And we believe that we will be revealing those over time to you. We've put the $400 million out there and obviously, you know that we don't communicate anything that we don't have the exact execution plan behind it to you guys. So as we start developing those plans and they become more crystallized, we will definitely be communicating that. What we wanted to make sure that you guys took away from today's call is that that $400 million is the bottom of what we believe is possible and that with these additional opportunities, that we've been identifying in the back half of this year, that we continue to believe that there is substantially more opportunity there. So we'll keep you posted as we go, let's get the $400 million delivered as well and then we can talk about more, but there's no doubt that based on some of the looking we're doing \u2013 and you guys, these are very structural and they're going to come through the product flow and how it comes through Best Buy, it's going to come through our return process, especially on large cube inventory there is so much opportunity there. There's recovery on inventory that is returned, it's how we handle the movement across the United States of some of our larger cube inventory. This comes in many forms. The great news is it comes in many forms. And there is no lap of opportunity and I'm going to take one more minute just to lay a backdrop for why is there this much opportunity at Best Buy. The reason we have these opportunities is because if you think about the growth years for Best Buy, they were opening 50 stores a year and adding $1 billion to $2 billion a year of incremental revenue. And during that time, when you have that kind of growth, trying to keep pace with all of the operational excellence that goes behind that, what you end up doing is creating a large number of triage processes, meaning that well, we don't have the systems to do this, so we're going to create this workaround and it will work. And then the workaround gets bigger and bigger and bigger as the company continued to grow. But just about the time they get ready to fix it, they just added another 50 stores and another $2 billion worth of revenue and of course that was the focus back then. Now that the company has reached such scale, these opportunities, these workarounds have become very costly and thus the opportunity that we have to take them out, but leave it to understand that they are structural and a lot of change has to happen and that's why you don't just throw them out there on a list and say yeah, I totally am going to be communicating that, we need to give you guys clarity to the roadmap. Hubert Joly - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer : So maybe it's the time, a few words of closing remarks. First of all, of course we were pleased this morning to share some of our good news about earnings and our plans to return capital to shareholders. Hopefully, you feel that we're quite excited about opportunities going forward, and proud of our execution capabilities. So I certainly want to again thank our associates who are behind this execution capability, and thank you for your continued support. So all of us here wish you a terrific day. Thank you. Operator : That does conclude today's conference. We thank everyone for their participation.",

Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Sharon McCollam, our CAO and CFO. This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning.

I will now turn the call over to Hubert Hubert Joly : Thank you, Mollie and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let me begin by discussing the announcements we made today regarding Sharon McCollam and Corie Barry. Of course, I first want to thank Sharon for the profound and lasting impact she has had on Best Buy and her amazing partnership. As you all know, Sharon came out of retirement in 2012 to help revitalize Best Buy when the company was facing a multifaceted crisis. Three-and-a-half years later, we are in a very different place and are into the next phase of our journey as a company. And so as she transitioned out of her role, Sharon can look forward to spending more time with her husband with a sense of accomplishment and confidence in Best Buy's future. Now one of Sharon\u2019s legacies is our successor in the CFO role Corie Barry. Corie is a 16 year veteran of Best Buy and our current Chief Strategic Growth Officer. She has been groomed by Sharon for the CFO role almost since the time Sharon joined the company, and the two have collaborated on succession planning with the goal of making this a seamless transition. Over her many years at Best Buy, Corie has held a number of operational and financial roles in the field and at the corporate level, including as Senior Vice President of US Finance and as the Interim Head of our Services business. The Board, Sharon, and I, firmly believe that Corie has the kind of experience, skills and passion for Best Buy that make her the perfect choice for this position. I look forward to working with her in a new role. Sharon will remain as CFO until our Annual Shareholder Meeting on June 14, at which time Corie will assume her responsibilities. As part of this transition plan, Sharon will remain with Best Buy in an advisory role until the end of the fiscal year. The duties Sharon has as Chief Administrative Officer will be assumed by several members of our executive team. So let me say once again how grateful we are to Sharon for all that she has done. Her legacy will endure. So, Corie, allow me to publicly extend my congratulations. She has been a key player in Best Buy resurgence and I am confident she will be a great leader for our company in the years ahead. Altogether, I feel this is a remarkable time for our company. We have an exciting set of assets and opportunities and a very strong team, committed to creating great results for all our stakeholders. I will now provide an overview of our first quarter performance and an update on our progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities, and I will then turn the call over to Sharon for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. In the first quarter, we delivered better-than expected enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion, a 30 basis point improvement in our non-GAAP operating income rate to 2.9%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 versus $0.37 last year. In our domestic business, we delivered better-than expected, essentially flat comparable sales, versus our guidance of 1% to 2% decline. Contributing to these better-than expected results was the strong performance in our online channel which grew 24% in the quarter; and similar to last quarter's trends, from a merchandizing perspective, we saw strong year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater and appliances, offset by continued softness in mobile phones and tablets. Industry sales in the NPD reported categories which don't reflect mobile phone and appliance sales, declined 1.9% including the benefit of the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 fiscal 2017. We also saw significant gains in our net promoter score, which improved more than 600 basis points compared to this time last year, more than 600 basis points. In our International business, strong execution and higher sales retention in our Canadian business, drove a better-than expected revenue decline of 1.2% on a constant currency basis, despite closing approximately one-third or 66 of our of our large format stores on March 28th of last year. On a reported basis, revenue declined 8% versus our guidance of 15% to 20% decline, primarily due to a lower than expected negative impact from foreign currency and the higher sales retention we have seen in Canada. So all together, a strong quarter and I want to thank our teams across all functions, for delivering these results. Now I\u2019d like to share highlights of the progress we are making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. As we discussed on our Q4 call, our first priority is to build on our strong industry position in multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. This involves in implementing a number of initiatives across merchandizing, marketing, digital, stores, supply chain, services and customer care. In Appliances, we leveraged our 176 specific kitchen and home stores-within-a-store and ongoing market share gains to deliver a 14% increase in revenue, and our 22nd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. As a reminder, we will continue to rollout incremental stores-within-a-store throughout the year. In home theater, our market-leading customer experienced around 4k and large screen technologies continued to drive sales growth and market share gains. We continue to build on this experience by rolling out 376 new LG experiences in addition to our existing Sony and Samsung experiences. In Computing, similar to home theater, our partnership with key vendors and the strength of our market-leading position has created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains. In mobile, we added 25 incremental Verizon and AT&T stores-within-a-store to the 250 we rolled out in the back half of last year. However, the mobile phone category remains challenging as industry demand continues to be soft. Despite this current softness, we continue to believe that over the course of the year, iconic new phone launches can drive renewed growth in this category. In our online business, our 24% sales growth was driven by continued improvement to our digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities, including faster shipping. We continue to focus on improving the shopping journey for our customers, including streamlining the checkout process providing visibility earlier in the shopping funnel for local store product availability, improving the quality and relevance of product recommendations and increasing search relevancy and accuracy. In our retail stores, the level of proficiency and engagement of our associates is continuing to drive meaningful improvements in our net promoter score among both purchasers and non-purchasers and is contributing to our market share gains. In our services business, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increased our Net Promoter Score. Year-over-year our Geek Squad agents also drove more customer interactions across our channels and helped more customers use and enjoy their technology products. As expected, overall services revenue declined during the quarter due to the carryover effect of the pricing investments we made last September, as well as the ongoing reductions of retail revenue driven by lower frequency of claims on our extended warranty. As a reminder, while at face value this repair revenue decline appears negative, it is actually financially beneficial because it reflects a reduction of our extended warranty costs. In our international business, we remain focused on our Canadian transformation as reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected. Looking ahead, our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that is enabled by the consolidation of the two brands. And a second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. Reducing cost is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, those our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplifying and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out. This work is well on its way. I want to stress that this is not an isolated short-term cost reduction program, we are establishing a lean culture focused on systematically eliminating non-quality and defects. This approach requires collaboration across teams and fractions and we are building the organizational capabilities, mind set and habits necessary to sustain changes. As it relates to our renewed Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over three years, we achieved another $50 million in the first quarter bringing our current achievement to $200 million. The third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. While there may be short-term pressures, we continue to believe, we operate in an opportunity rich environment. We are investing to make it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important for them in their life. We see fiscal 2017 as a year of exploration and experimentation around creating compelling customer experiences that have the potential to unlock growth. Throughout the year, we will be testing and piloting several concepts around the country and with our combination of digital store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. So to recap, we delivered a strong first quarter and are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 full year financial outlook that we provided in our Q4 call. That outlook includes approximately flat revenue in non-GAAP operating income, with EPS growth driven by share repurchases. Although we are reporting better-than expected results today, we are not raising our full year outlook as the first quarter represents less than 15% of full year earnings and at this stage, we have no new material information as it relates to product launches throughout the year. And now, and of course, it's a bit emotional, let me turn the call over to my friend, Sharon McCollam. Sharon, anything you\u2019d like to share with us this morning? Sharon McCollam : Yes, I do, Hubert. Thank you. While I remain in advisory capacity through the end of the year, this is my last official call as CFO and as such, I want to take this opportunity to express what an immense privilege it has been to be part of this incredible transformation. With our team of more than 125,000 people, we have worked hand-in-hand to Renew Blue. And today, as I prepare to step down to my current role, and spend more time with my husband and my family, I do so knowing that we have never been as well positioned as we are today to take Best Buy to a new level. I\u2019d like to thank my peers, our corporate and field teams, and in particular, my direct reports for their exceptional contributions that have made this possible. I would also like to thank our Board and you, our shareholders and analysts for your confidence and support. Additionally, I want to publicly congratulate Corie. Corie has been my strategic right-hand partner since I joined Best Buy. With her exceptional financial acumen and deep understanding of Best Buy\u2019s operations, she has been an influential leader over the financial and cost disciplines that have been established across the company over the past several years. She has also a highly respected cross-functional leader and will be an incredible CFO of whom I could not be more proud or confident. So congratulations Corie. And of course, I want to thank Hubert, he is an extraordinary leader and an inspiring business partner and a friend. I will be forever grateful to have had the opportunity to share this journey with you and our entire Best Buy family. Hubert Joly : Okay, thank you, Sharon. We owe you so much. Thank you. Sharon McCollam : Thank you, Hubert. Okay, so now let\u2019s talk about our Q1 results. Before I talk about these results last year, I would like to discuss them versus the expectations we shared with you in our Q4 call. Enterprise revenue of $8.44 billion exceeded our expectations driven equally by the outperformance of our domestic and international businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44 also exceeded our expectations primarily due to the flow through of higher revenues. Additionally, a lower effective income tax rate contributed to an incremental penny of EPS versus our expectations. I will now talk about our Q1 results versus last year. On a constant currency basis, Enterprise revenue declined 0.8% to $8.44 billion primarily due to the impact of domestic and Canadian store closures. On a reported basis, Enterprise revenue declined 1.3% reflecting approximately 55 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.07 or 19% to $0.44. This increase was primarily driven by Canada which is lapping the disrupted impact from the brand consolidation last year and a $0.04 per share benefit from share repurchases. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact of lower revenue in the Domestic segment, and a higher non-GAAP effective income tax rate. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased a less than expected 0.8% to $7.8 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by the loss of revenues from 13 large format and 24 Best Buy mobile store closures. Comparable sales were essentially flat. From a merchandizing perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by decline in mobile phones, tablets and gaming. As expected, television sales related to the shift of the Super Bowl into Q1 2017 positively impacted the Domestic segment by approximately 70 basis points. In Services, comparable revenue declined 10.7% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.9% to $832 million, primarily due to higher conversion rate and increased traffic. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 210 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.5% last year. In our International segment, on a constant currency basis, revenue declined 1.2% to $614 million due primarily to closed stores in Canada. On a reported basis, International revenue declined 8.1% reflecting approximately 690 basis points of negative foreign currency impacts. Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.2%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23% primarily due to a prior year reserve on non-iconic phone inventory which did not recur this year and improved rates primarily driven by our more disciplined promotional strategy across product categories. These increases were partially offset by our investments in service pricing. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 310 basis points to 25.9% primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as we lapped the significant disruption and corresponding increased promotional activities related to the brand consolidation in Q1 fiscal 2016 and we received a higher periodic profit sharing payment in our Services business. Now turning to SG&A, Enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.7 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or flat on a rate basis. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.56 billion or 19.9% of revenue, which was flat year-over-year as investments in the business were offset by the flow through of Renew Blue phase two cost reductions. From a rate perspective, non-GAAP SG&A increased 10 basis points, primarily driven by year-over-year sales deleverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was $156 million or 25.4% of revenue, a decrease of $23 million or 140 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the elimination of expenses associated with the Canadian brand consolidation and the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. I will now discuss our fiscal 2017 and Q2 2017 outlook. As Hubert said, from a financial outlook perspective, we are reaffirming our expectations of approximately flat revenues and flat non-GAAP operating income for the full year including lapping the significant periodic profit-sharing benefits from our Services plans portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016. A key element to achieve this, will be the delivery of our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. Based on current industry dynamic and how we see the various product cycles playing out, we are expecting slight declines in revenue in the first half followed by growth in the back half. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we recognize this will be challenging without a stronger mobile cycle and improvement in the NPD reported categories overall. I would now like to talk about our Q2 financial guidance. For Q2, we are expecting enterprise revenue in the range of $8.35 billion to $8.45 and both Enterprise and Domestic comparable sales of approximately flat. We expect International revenue to decline approximately 5% to 10% on a reported basis, but to be flat on a constant currency basis. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.42, assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately $325 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 36% to 36.5%. Inline with our original expectations, there are two factors impacting our Q2 year-over-year non-GAAP EPS guidance. First, we are expecting an approximate $0.03 net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic profit sharing payment from our services plan portfolio that we received in the second quarter of last year. Second, we are expecting an approximate $0.06 negative impact from the carryover of last September\u2019s Services pricing investment. In addition, in digital imaging, we are now expecting an approximate $0.03 to $0.04 negative impact due to the April 2016 earthquake in Japan, which is impacting inventory availability in this high marking category. Combined, these are putting $0.12 to $0.13 of pressure on Q2 fiscal 2017 which will be partially offset by approximate $0.04 benefit from share repurchases. I would now like to turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matt McClintock : Good morning, everyone, and best of luck, Sharon. Really, we're going to miss you. I was wondering if we could talk about the online growth rate for the quarter. I think that's the best growth rate you guys have achieved in two years and it's interesting, because it's coming at a time that we're seeing other retailers, their growth rates decelerate and your growth rate online is accelerating. Can you maybe talk a little bit more in detail on what's going on in that business specifically? Thank you. Hubert Joly : Yes, thank you, Matt, and good morning. We are very focused on the digital experience for a couple of reasons, one is, the e-commerce channel is growing and two, it\u2019s impacting the entire business. Specifically, to the growth rate in e-commerce, the 24% growth rate is a very good number. It\u2019s really the cumulative effect of the investments we\u2019ve been making in the last three years that are impacting the customer experience. We are shipping faster, that\u2019s a very important point. But if you go on the site and I hope all of you regular shoppers on the site, you know, three years ago we\u2019d have calculated our site as being clunky. Today there is all sorts of good surprises, as you shop, as you research, as you look for information about the products. We\u2019ve made improvements in the quarter, on the checkout process. So, it\u2019s a lot of small changes, both on the site itself and of course, the mobile experience that\u2019s been investing significantly. So really a combination of what\u2019s happening on the site, the shipping experience, we've improved in-store pickup, the experience in the stores. So it's an all out effort. Really the cumulative impact of the investment and improvements we\u2019ve been making over the last three years. Matt McClintock : Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Hey guys, and congratulations to Corie and good luck, Sharon. I guess, I wanted to go the same route with the e-commerce and just as it grows and I am actually on your website right now and clearly you guys have done a lot of work. Does - how does it fit into the stores? In other words, how does it fit into the asset base and your thought process around the asset base if the growth in e-commerce continues at such a rapid clip? Does it make you think that maybe some further store closures would be on the table or no? Hubert Joly : Well, thank you for the question. If we think of the company as a company that is there to provide a great experience for the customer across all channels and increasingly it will be difficult to measure the contribution of each channel, because and you guys all know the shopping journey starts online may then be completed online or in the stores, there is a journey to the store. If you are going to buy a 4K TV the only way to see the quality of the picture and ask questions is really in the store, but then the transaction may be completed in the store or online. So our overall goal as a company frankly, is to accelerate the total revenue growth from the customers, existing customers and new customers, so that we can create shareholder value and value for all of the stakeholders. In a context where revenue, total revenue would be flat, then yes, it would put pressure on the economics in the business. As you know, from a store portfolio standpoint, since the beginning of the Renew Blue journey, we have said that we would over time optimize the store footprint, and we're doing this on an ongoing basis and we are ready to continue to do that. But I would say, the overriding objective is to accelerate the growth so that it can lift our boats in our journey. Sharon, anything you would like to add to this? Sharon McCollam : Yes, Hubert, I also want to point out the strategic portfolio that we have at stores because, about a third of our customers still today actually choose to pick their orders up in our stores. So this alignment between the online channel and the ability to let the customer receive their product either through the mail or in our store, but it's more importantly about how they choose to receive it. Additionally, our stores are the magic that go behind our ship from store and our delivery times, which as you know, we\u2019ve created North Star which is Amazon Prime, and with that, our stores are essential to that process. So the store portfolio, while to Hubert's point, we had rationalized the portfolio and we will continue to do so. The stores are also really working hard on a concept which we talked about for a long time which is our value-add. And the stores have a critical role in the growth, not only of our store channel, but the e-com channel and today, the number of orders that are actually being placed in our stores online and that capability, that Hubert talked about capabilities that we\u2019ve been building, we have been making it easier and easier for us to convert a customer where there maybe something that may not be in a store and they want it in the stores, our Blue Shirts are doing a remarkable job of converting that order in the store which turns into an online order. So, from a portfolio standpoint, I think our store portfolio is extremely strategic and we will continue to rationalize it, but quite frankly, it just continues to lift its performance and that\u2019s great news for us. Scott Mushkin : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot. Good morning, Sharon. All the best to you, of course. My question relates to wireless. If you could talk about, within that mobile and computing line item, which was picked up a little bit of ground versus Q4 what you saw specifically for the wireless trend in Q1 relative to the Q4 decline that you had noted? Hubert Joly : Yes, good morning, Matt. The wireless industry market and there is some public information around this, has continued to be quite soft in the quarter as we anniversary a more iconic launch the previous year. So it\u2019s continued to be soft and we continue to believe that significant launches in the back half of the year can revert the trends. So really, very consistent pattern compared to the previous quarter, to be specifically answering your question. Sharon McCollam : And just adding to that, Matt, adding to that, it is I think important to note though, that when there were some new product launches in the quarter, we did see an improvement in performance and so that gives us confidence that, as new things, I don\u2019t want to exaggerate that, as new things come to market, we have seen a slight improvement in that in the back half of the quarter. Matthew Fassler : And to the extent that your same-store sales declined in Domestic computing and mobile moderated to 3.5% from 6.5% was that improvement then in computing as opposed to wireless? Hubert Joly : Yes, so, computing, we have a very strong position in computing. We\u2019ve in partnership with key vendors we built a superior customer experience we've a place where to shop for computer - we are gaining share and we\u2019ve accelerated our momentum in the quarter compared to the previous quarter, absolutely. Matthew Fassler : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Thanks. Wanted to follow-up on the SG&A comment, and I think in the prepared comments, Hubert and Sharon, you talked about taking out costs to increase investment. So if you look at that number, if you just look at the Domestic SG&A, which was flat, I guess, year-over-year, how much of that was cost out and how much of that was investment and if we thought about it going forward, is the first quarter sort of typical, if you think about the rest of the year in terms of that investment? Thanks. Hubert Joly : Yes, so, thank you for \u2013 good morning, Greg. Thank you for your question. Strategically, we are very focused \u2013 we\u2019ve been very focused and we will continue to be very focused on driving efficiencies throughout the business. So as to \u2013 as we said, from the investments and increase our resilient cycles and over time improve our profitability. Quarter-to-quarter things will fluctuate a little bit based on variable compensation, marketing, that fluctuates a little bit. In the first quarter, we are very proud of the cost reductions we\u2019ve made that have offset the investments. So, for the full year, that\u2019s the pattern. We have talked about and that will continue to drive and we are pacing ourselves with the discipline that we have. We are pacing the investment base on the cost reduction. Sharon, anything you\u2019d like to add? Sharon McCollam : Yes, Hubert. So, and as you just \u2013 remember that as you look towards Q2, we are expecting to see a similar SG&A outcome dollar decline in Q2 as well. Again, that will be investments being offset by the recognition of our Renew Blue phase two cost reductions. But, sequentially, Q2 is always a bigger SG&A quarter for us, because our advertising kicks in to our back-to-school. So, when you are looking at it sequentially quarter-to-quarter, much better to take a look at it, because we do have seasonality in the SG&A, best to look at it year-over-year, but in the Q2 outlook, we are anticipating that SG&A will \u2013 at Enterprise level, it\u2019s going to look very similar to Q1 on a year-over-year basis. Greg Melich : Great. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Brad Thomas : Thank you. Good morning. Sharon, best wishes to you and Corie, congratulations. I wanted to ask a question about International and I was just hoping for an update on how things are progressing in Canada. What kind of transfer rate you've been seeing from the brand consolidation and what sort of operating income and EPS benefit you are looking forward to this year? Thank you. Hubert Joly : Yes, good morning, Brad, and thank you for your question. We are very excited about the changes we have made in Canada. It\u2019s going to take a while before things settle, because year-over-year comparisons are going to be little bit difficult to assess, that sort of with a lot of disruptions in Q1, Q2 and going into Q3. So, but altogether, the decision to consolidate the two brands was very fundamental to our future. As you remember, that these two brands often time, two stores in the same parking lot made it difficult for us to invest in the stores, because many of them were sort of critical mass and so, we have unlocked that. The retention has been materially better than expected and much better than what we are seeing in the US and that\u2019s a strong capability. Probably the reflection on our strong leadership position in the market and the combination of higher retention and closing stores of course, will have a positive impact on the profitability. This is going to be a smaller more profitable business for us, but above and beyond the short-term profit improvement, the long-term commitment with now that we have simplified the business is the ability that we have to invest in the customer experience online, in the stores and in the home. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s it. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve given specific numbers on the retention materially, but we can almost do the math, because Canada is the bulk of the international business. We have given you the dates at which we\u2019ve closed the stores. The number of stores and you can almost do the math. It\u2019s a pretty significant retention. So we are very happy about it. Brad Thomas : Great. Thank you. Sharon McCollam : Yes, Brad \u2013 just take a look at the \u2013 on a reported basis the revenue on a constant currency basis, just declined little over 1% and obviously, at the end of March last year, we closed a third of our stores about 60 plus stores. So, when you look at that, you can see the retention is pretty exceptional and the execution of that team has been remarkable. Brad Thomas : And of course, it looks like it's shaping up to be a nice contributor here this year, any reason that the pace of benefit that we saw in the first quarter may not continue at this rate going forward? Hubert Joly : Yes, absolutely, because the \u2013 said in the first part of my response, the year-over-year comparison is going to be very muddy for the few quarters. Think about last quarter. We closed stores in the middle of the quarter. We actually closed the Future Shop for a full week. The Future Shop that continued, we closed them for a full week to retrain the associates. For several months, the Future Shop stores, even though we have announced that we were closing Future Shops, the Future Shop store still look like Future Shop stores. It took us let into the summer to rebrand them as Best Buy stores. So if you can imagine the Canadian customer who is very confused. Then there was some extraordinary expenses last year as we were going through the transition. And so, it\u2019s really difficult to \u2013 you should not extrapolate. Let me be very clear. The Q1 results, and assume that\u2019s the kind of improvement is going to be something, we fully expect it\u2019s going to be better, but it\u2019s going to be rocky comparison from the first few quarters. Sharon McCollam : And, Brad, as a reminder, we talked about when we did the Canadian brand consolidation, which is actually exciting. We have been testing into some work in our stores. We have talked about, there would be a capital investment this year that was when we gave our outlook on CapEx for this year. There was a little more CapEx because we were going to do more work in Canada. We\u2019ve been doing it very methodically testing seeing what works, rolling it very judiciously and what Hubert is speaking to, as we work through the year, is they are going to be periods, especially before holiday while we will be making some of those investments and so, it will be some puts and takes in the next couple quarters around Canada. But there is no question that we are expecting a improvement in their performance. Brad Thomas : Gotcha. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Best of luck, Sharon and congratulations, Corie. Hubert, the spread between Best Buy's Domestic same-store sales and the change in the category as measured by NPD compressed a bit this quarter suggesting that your share gains moderated a bit. Why do you think that was? And is it right to expect that this tighter spread from the first quarter will persist moving forward or might it even compress a bit further from here? Hubert Joly : So, good morning, Michael. I appreciate it\u2019s hard to track, because what we have when we report our earnings, is NPD, and NPD for us is a meaningful part of the categories we talk about 60% flat. But it excludes appliances and phones. And so, why the NPD category has improved, and bear in mind that there is a suitable, but it\u2019s not 1.9% probably may be between 2.5% and 3% decline of NPD when normalizing for the suitable. You have a very material decline in phones. And so, we estimated that we are continuing to gain share at a pretty consistent pattern. We have not seen any material change there. Of course, it varies by category. We think that, I mean, if the entire strategy of the company over the last three years on top of the cost reductions was made, is the very systematic and significant improvements in the customer experience across all touch points across all channels that are resulting in us gaining share and being able to reach the revenue for this quarter. So, no material change Michael. We will continue to monitor this, but bear in mind, the softness in mobile. Michael Lasser : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : We will go next to Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. Sharon, first off, congratulations on how much you contributed to the Best Buy turnaround and congratulations Corie, as well. So, just following up on that question, can you talk about share in the TV category and I think a lot of retailers talk about deceleration in the April, May timeframe. It doesn't seem like that actually happened to you, because ex Super Bowl shift you are still guiding to about the same comp in the second quarter. So, what changed in the business during that timeframe? Was that PC getting better? Was that Mobile picking up a little bit more there? Thanks. Hubert Joly : So, Chris, good morning. In the quarter, I think, compared to our expectations, computing was better. No doubt about this. Again the results of our partnerships with the key vendors and great customer experience across all of the touch points, computing was better and phones was softer. And, the week-to-week, month-to-month variations are not going to go there because it\u2019s they go with this or that. But on a quarterly basis, yes, you\u2019ve heard our Q2 guidance and it\u2019s very consistent with Q1. And so, we will continue move for this. One element of philosophy for the company is that, there maybe situations in the customer buying intentions and mood and so forth, we know what we can control. And the focus on execution, the ability to control what we can control is the key mantra to the company across all touch points, and believe me, while we are proud of what we\u2019ve done, we have so much more to do across all channels in driving our performance, we will continue to be focused on that. When we manage our teams, we are not interested in excuses of any sorts. It\u2019s all about the performance they can drive. Chris Horvers : And then on the TV share question? Sharon McCollam : Yes, we did gain share in television and we\u2019d expect to, based on the premium experience that we have to offer the customer in our store. We continue with the tremendous partnership that we have with Samsung and Sony and LG, et cetera. With our partnerships, we have an exceptional experience in our stores. These are still new technologies for all the customers that are buying new 4K TVs and we are continuing to offer the customer a very, very strong experience and I think that\u2019s differentiating us from others. I also think that as you are looking at these weeks and months as industry data, including even the NPD data, this Super Bowl shift is really a big shift for all of us. So, I think that the conversation gets a little sloppy, because of the Super Bowl shift. So, t that\u2019s just a broad statement for all when you are interpreting all of the results that are coming out, I think that is an issue. Hubert Joly : If I may, add one word on TVs, looking ahead, I think that everybody would expect that. Various product cycles and Best Buy tends to do particularly well in the first part of the \u2013 every product cycle and then as the technology gets more mass, then it gets into more places. And at some point, the growth in TVs will slow down, if not revert on them, at some point, we would expect, could not be able to hold the kind of great share we\u2019ve had. We are not surrendering in advance, but as investors, you guys are been around, you know that this is the kind of thing that happens. So when it happens, don\u2019t be surprised. Chris Horvers : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks, congratulations, Sharon, and we'd welcome you out of retirement any time. A question on Renew Blue two, I think you are now at $200 million of savings, about halfway to that $400 million goal. It seems like it's going well and maybe faster than you've been \u2013 you\u2019ve expected and you've mentioned there is some upside. Are there any large items that's on a future list that\u2019s not part of that bucket yet that you can haven\u2019t been able to touch, because you are waiting for other capabilities to fall into place? Just thinking about ways you can get upside to those numbers. Hubert Joly : Yes, the pattern in the last few years has been to increase the number when we achieve the number. Remember, when we had announced $725 million, we increased it to $1 billion when we had achieved that $725 million. So, we fully expect to continue that pattern. This said, in this new phase, I think this is a very exciting new phase, this notion of ongoing process improvements and lean approach, I think is very exciting, because it because it simultaneously improves the employee experience, the customer experience and the cost structure. The buckets we are attacking has a lot to do which causes overall product flow integrated supply chain as you would like which of course includes the work we still have to do on returns, replacements and damages and end of life and so forth. While we have a pattern of humbly looking at one step at a time, the overall cost structure there and process improvement opportunities give us a lot of optimism around what can be done. So, the teams are very busy at work. They are very methodical and we\u2019ll keep you updated. We are not going to give a number today, but we are confident that we will be able to have a gift that keeps giving over many years coming from that broad area. Simeon Gutman : And the $400 million, that goal is by the end of next fiscal year? Hubert Joly : We had given three years. So that would be correct. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth Sigman : Thanks. Good morning, and Sharon, congrats again and obviously Corie, congrats to you, as well. I just want to follow-up on one of the last questions about the near-term outlook. You just did flat comps basically with a 70 basis point benefit from the Super Bowl. You are guiding to flat comps in Q2, so that would imply that something is getting better and you have a pretty difficult comparison in that quarter. So, any more color on how you are thinking about that and what gives you confidence in that underlying trend? Thanks. Hubert Joly : Yes, good morning. I think the categories that we expect to continue to do well are those that we\u2019ve mentioned, health and wearables or home theater and appliances where we have a strong continued track record offset by phones and tablets and we have referenced the digital imaging piece. Frankly, the variations you are talking about from one quarter to the other are pretty small. So this is our team\u2019s best estimate based on the improvement in the customer experience. The promotional calendar, the momentum in the various product categories and then we are focused on delivering that. No massive shifts, it\u2019s a lot of small moving pieces that equates to this aggregate number which is not a huge variation again. Even if you take the Super Bowl piece, it\u2019s less than 100 basis points. So it\u2019s really small, but we are on it. Seth Sigman : Okay, that's helpful. And just one follow-up question about the mobile category, specifically, how you are thinking about Best Buy mobile standalone stores? So I realize there is some optimism about the second half outlook here and some of the product drivers, but the growth of the category has been a little bit more challenged. Is there any more color you can provide on how those Best Buy mobile standalone stores have performed, even just in relative terms, from a profit perspective and if there is an opportunity to maybe accelerate some of the closings, I think you still have 350 or so stores? Thanks. Hubert Joly : Do you want to take that? Sharon McCollam : Sure, I\u2019d be happy to. So, our Best Buy mobile stores actually play a very strategic marketing role for us at Best Buy. And we are going to have cycles in mobile ups and downs. These are obviously our smaller stores. But these teams in our mobile stores have some of the highest NPS scores in the entire mobile business, because of the specialty nature of how we can serve our customers in those stores. They also tend to fit in malls versus our big box stores which do not fit in malls. So they play a very interesting strategic marketing role. Now we have said for the last several years that when you are thinking about in modeling our business, you really need to model the big boxes. The mobile stores, our goal for the mobile stores is to make them a colorful marketing customer service vehicle, a convenience place for our customers, but as far as increases in profits over the years et cetera, that is not a modeling that we are doing and we\u2019d certainly wouldn\u2019t want you guys to do that, only to be plus or minus a little, but they are quite small. And as far as the rationalization, we have closed some of the stores, again, very similar to our view on the big box stores. We want to continue to offer to our customers these retail locations where it makes sense. When a store doesn\u2019t make sense, you guys know we have not been shy about closing a few here and there. But at this point, there is no major plan out there to further rationalize that portfolio. I don\u2019t know about you guys, that I love free marketing and the fact that they can pay for themselves and offer our customers such an exceptional experience is a pretty compelling reason to let this fleet run. Seth Sigman : Okay. Thanks again and best of luck. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : Next is Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Hey guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Can you provide any more color on the TV business? Namely, what are you seeing today in terms of unit velocity versus ASP compression and then how do you expect that to play out in the second half? Thanks. Hubert Joly : Yes, good morning, Scot. You do have ASP compression year-over-year, which makes it \u2013 which makes 4K large screen TVs very exciting to buy and help with the penetration. So, that\u2019s, of course the characteristic of our business and it\u2019s quite material. I think for NPD, the decline for 4K average selling price is approximately 30% during the period we\u2019ve had. So that\u2019s very material. We expect this will continue in the back half and so forth which will make the category very exciting from a consumer standpoint. And again, we\u2019ll start to bring this to a more mass status. We remain very confident in the amazing customer experience that we\u2019ve built both online, but notably in our stores. If you want to buy a 4K TV, we are the place to do this. Our teams are ready. Scot Ciccarelli : Great, and just a clarification there, Hubert. If we continue to see the ASP declines that we are and presumably there tends to be some even further acceleration just from a seasonal standpoint, what are we thinking about, in terms of actual revenue from the TV category in terms of - is unit velocity, unit growth enough to offset the ASP declines or are we getting to that point where, as you referenced earlier, TV isn't necessarily growing at that point? Thanks. Hubert Joly : Yes, of course, looking into the back half of the year, last year where we had some pretty significant ASP declines, but, to your point and my comment earlier, there will be a point of time to call exactly when, when the ASP decline will in fact impact the overall revenue in the industry. So, this is a big category for us. We are doing well with it, but there will be a point where we should expect to see that. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay, I'll follow-up. Thank you. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker : Thanks. So two questions, I'll ask them at the same time. One, just on product category, I know it's early, but just wondering your thoughts on virtual reality and if that can help drive the mobile business at all in the second half. And then, I guess, an unrelated, but I'll throw it in there question, anyway, is buybacks a little bit lower than of course, in the fourth quarter, but it looks like, if we look at last year you also did not buy a lot of shares in the first quarter. So do we expect a similar type pattern to play out, not a lot of buybacks in the first quarter and then accelerating through the year? Sharon McCollam : Yes, I\u2019ll let Hubert take virtual reality, I\u2019ll then come back to you on share repurchase. Hubert Joly : Yes, virtual reality is a very exciting technology. I bet you all have seen that we were the exclusive place where you could try the Oculus in our stores. So a lot of excitement there. The impact on the business this year is going to be very marginal. So, I think exciting from a consumer NPR standpoint, very small at this point from a revenue standpoint. Sharon, on the buyback, why didn\u2019t we buy more shares in the first quarter? Sharon McCollam : Hubert, yes, it really is the way our pattern has been since we\u2019ve been buying shares back. Remember that, we \u2013 because of year end earnings releases, there is a period in the middle of the first quarter where we are out of the market until we get our information out there. So we are always going to be a little bit lower probably in the first quarter, you guys can probably expect that, because that\u2019ll be probably be the case and then of course, we are absolutely committed to our $1 billion repurchase over the next couple of years. So, we are all in on that. Hubert Joly : Yes. Mike Baker : Thank you. Operator : And our final question will come from David Schick with Consumer Edge Research. David Schick : Hi, good morning, and I will add my congratulations to Sharon and Corie, the long list of congratulations. In our store checks, we see the Blue Shirts very engaged and consultative over the last quarter or two, not that they weren't before but sort of reaching a new level, and I know you've been working on that. Could you talk about how that focus works at the store level? Could you talk about how we should think about that impacting the business? Is it building steam? Or is there some sort of lap we should understand in that emphasis? Hubert Joly : David, thank you, so much for your comment. This will go to the heart of all of our Blue Shirts, the fact that we are telling them that we are seeing it, it\u2019s great the fact that you are seeing is just terrific and I want to publicly again recognize their work. The work on developing the engagement and proficiency in the stores has been a key area for us and I have to give credit \u2013 where credit is due to Shari Ballard and her team across the country in driving that. What is the form that it takes is your question. It\u2019s a number of things. The most impressive thing is that the individual level. The philosophy is that the performance of Best Buy is really the sum of the individual performance of each individual associate. The way you lift the performance of Best Buy is by getting more of the associates to be very proficient, very engaged and to achieve their individual sales targets. As you know we are not commissioned, but we are driving performance. The form it takes in the stores is through daily coaching. Every morning, when you check in as an associate, you spend time with your supervisor looking at the results and getting a one-on-one and it\u2019s absolutely world-class and coaching about how you can get better at your job. The individual associates - looking at the performance will look at whatever things they can get better, they may get some ideas from their manager and then check ins during the day and then check-in at the end of the day. It\u2019s a systematic approach. Now, on top of that, we are increasingly focused on listing the product knowledge, the proficiencies, selling skills and product knowledge with moving to certify the associates and raising the bar in terms of what\u2019s expected. All of the executive team at Best Buy is certified to sell 4K TV and high-end networking equipment showing that it\u2019s part of the job. If the boss says kind of do the job, then, it\u2019s not a good company. So, there is a \u2013 and then of course, it goes to all of the associates. So it\u2019s really beautiful to see, we believe there is a lot more room to drive performance on that basis. We look at, Shari, the percentage of - and her team, we look at the percentage of associates who are achieving the individual sales targets, we see a lot of room for improvement. And that\u2019s a continued focus of the way it manifests itself is that, a store gets the traffic it gets, that\u2019s not within essentially the control of the store, but they are focused on, what we call value-add, which is the difference between the traffic and then the comp stores in the stores and with a given traffic, you can get different results. And so, with the same amount of payroll, you can get different results. So, we think that this is another gift that we will keep giving and truly a remarkable set of accomplishment so far. So, Shari, congratulations for your work. But beyond, Shari, well done to the entire Best Buy team across the stores. Couldn't be more proud. So, I need to conclude the call. I want to thank all of you for our joining us today. Again, a very strong quarter. Again, I want to congratulate all of our teams. We are - as you can see, we are very excited to have the opportunity to continue to work on our key priorities and with the opportunities that are related to that. I want to join everybody, of course, on the call in congratulating Sharon and Corie. I know, Corie is very much looking forward to meeting all of you and working with all of you. I know, Sharon is very much looking forward to introducing. As a reminder, Sharon is not going away, as she is going to be here until the end of the year in an advisory role. She will introduce Corie to each of the investors and analysts and work with Corie to make this an incredibly seamless transition. It\u2019s going to be one of Sharon\u2019s legacy to have successfully onboarded \u2013 chosen and onboarded and grooomed and onboarded Corie. So, very exciting time ahead. Thank you so much for your attention. You all have a great day. Sharon McCollam : Bye guys. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.",

Welcome to Best Buy\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by 10 :00 a.m. Central Start Time today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mollie O\u2019Brien: Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO and Corie Barry, our CFO. This morning\u2019s conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning. Today\u2019s release and conference call both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, which should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release. Today\u2019s earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial conditions, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company\u2019s current earnings release and SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. In today\u2019s earnings release and conference call, we refer to NPD tracked categories. The categories tracked by the NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 64% of our domestic revenue. It did not include mobile phones, appliances, services, gaming, Apple Watch, movies, music or Amazon branded products. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I will begin today with a review of our second quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we are making against our fiscal 2017 priorities. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and commentary on our financial outlook. So, in the second quarter, we delivered better than expected enterprise revenue of $8.53 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $0.57 versus $0.49 last year, an increase of 16%. These results were due to the strong performance of both our domestic and international segments. In our domestic business, we delivered comparable sales of 0.8% versus our guidance of approximately flat. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 3.8% last year. We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel delivering a second straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. Similar to last quarter\u2019s trends from an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, and appliances, partially offset by continued softness in mobile phones and gaming. Industry sales in the NPD tracked categories, which don\u2019t include important categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.2%. We also continued to see considerable year-over-year improvement in our overall net promoter score, which increased approximately 500 basis points over Q2 last year. In our international business, strong execution and higher than expected sales retention in Canada contributed to revenue growth of 4.1% on a constant currency basis versus our guidance of flat. On a reported basis, international revenue declined 1% versus our guidance of a 5% to 10% decline. So, altogether, we have delivered a strong first half ahead of our expectations, and I want to thank all of our associates for their focus, passion, and work they have put into delivering these results. We have also continued to make progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. Our first priority is to build on our strong industry position in multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. In home theater, our market leading customer experience around 4K and large screen premium technologies in our 79 Magnolia Design Center stores within a store continued to drive sales growth and market share gains. During the quarter, we rolled out 376 new LG experiences in our stores in addition to our existing 660 Samsung and 388 Sony experiences. In appliances, we leveraged our 200 Pacific Kitchen and Home stores within a store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 23rd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. We reported 8.2% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 21% in Q2 of last year. During the quarter, we implemented a number of improvements to our installation and delivery capabilities, including the ability for online and in-store customers to choose a shorter delivery time window at the point of purchase. In the long-term, we believe these innovative improvements will contribute to the continued growth of our appliance business. However, they did result in short-term disruptions that negatively impacted this quarter\u2019s growth rate. In computing, similar to home theater, our partnerships with key vendors, the strength of our market leading position, and our focus on assortment management and solution selling have created a superior customer experience that is driving continued market share gains. In the mobile category, as expected, revenue declined during the first half of the year, we expect this trend to reverse in the second half as anticipated product launches stimulate consumer demand and as we lap the sales declines seen in the category last year. In the entertainment category, we have been rolling out virtual reality merchandising. By holiday, we expect to be selling an expanded assortment of virtual reality products in the vast majority of our stores and more than 500 stores will be equipped with demo stations, so customers can try out this exciting new technology. We believe virtual reality has the potential to contribute to our growth in the future, but I am not expecting a material financial impact this year given the timing of launches, inventory availability, and the fact that we are early in the cycle. In services, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increased our net promoter score. As expected, overall services comparable sales declined during the quarter due to the carryover effect of the pricing investments we made last September as well as the ongoing reduction of repair revenue driven by lower frequency of claims on our extended warranties. We did see less of the sales decline this quarter compared to the past several quarters, and as we begin to anniversary the pricing investment, we expect comparable sales in our services business to be flat to slightly positive in the back half of the year. In our online business, our 24% online comparable sales growth was driven by the continued improvements to our digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities. These include, for example, faster shipping, responsive design, a more streamlined checkout process, improved search functionality, better visibility for open box and clearance items, and more relevant product recommendations. Also in our mobile app, we have implemented distilled reviews on over 40,000 SKUs. This means customers don\u2019t have to wait through hundreds or sometimes thousands of reviews, but can instead read a quick summary of the pros and cons of a product. In addition, across platforms, we can show customers\u2019 product that are available. Actually, we can show customers products that are available in the store closest to them and show which products are actually displayed in stores near them if they are interested in experiencing the product before they buy. Our e-commerce focus has evolved from the phase of building foundations to a phase of driving innovations for our customers, and we are excited about the customer experience improvements still in the pipeline yet for this year. In our stores, we are continuing to raise the bar and are seeing continued progress in our ability to deliver on our mission to help customers live their lives and pursue their passions with the help of technology. Given the complexity of technology and the needs of our customers, our store is our key asset for us. The level of proficiency and engagement of our associates is continuing to increase as manifested by the significant increase of our net promoter scores. This is the result of a deliberate and systematic effort to lift the capabilities and performance of each individual associates. This effort includes investment in training and daily coaching with their heightened focus on product knowledge and selling skills. Additionally, we are ensuring that our store general managers and assistant managers are staying in their stores longer, allowing them to be more effective at training, coaching, and more broadly leading their teams. We are also improving our store associate retention rates, particularly across our sales roles. We are not done, but the progress is noteworthy and encouraging. In our international business, Canadian transformation is continuing to make good progress as reflected in our revenue performance, customer retention is proving to be higher than expected. Our team is focused on continuing to invest in our stores and online channel to improve the customer experience and financial performance, something that has been enabled by the consolidation of the two brands we had in Canada. Similar to the domestic business, we are partnering with key vendors to upgrade our Canadian stores. Our second fiscal 2017 priority is to reduce costs and drive efficiency throughout the business. As we stated previously, we do think cost is essential for us to be able to fund our investments, build our resilience to product cycles and increase our profitability over time. A key element to achieving this is simplify and streamlining our core business processes, simultaneously improving the customer and employee experience and driving costs out. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 cost reduction and gross profit optimization target of $400 million over 3 years, we achieved another $50 million in the second quarter, bringing our current total to $250 million. Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store and in-home assets, we feel we have a great opportunity to address key customer pain points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers and unleash growth opportunities. Fiscal \u201817 is a year of exploration and experimentation and we are testing several concepts across the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. For example in a few markets, we are piloting an in-home advisor program, which involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology advisor, who can identify customers\u2019 needs, design a personalized solution and become a personal resource over time. In a few other markets, we are testing in-store classes on topics such as digital photography, home automation, maximizing your WiFi and helping parents ensure that their kids have a safe online experience. We are also testing Geek Squad on-demand services, including same day for customers who need immediate technology help or advice. So in summary, we are encouraged by the quality of our execution, the momentum in our business and the strength of our first half financial results and we are excited by our mission to help customers live their lives and pursue their passions with the help of technology and the growth opportunities of this mission and the related customer needs creates for us. Again, I want to thank everyone across the company for their focus, their passion and work to deliver everyday on this mission. Now I cannot close without mentioning that yesterday, we celebrated our 50th anniversary. 50 years ago to today, Dick Schulze opened the first Sound of Music store in St. Paul, Minnesota. And so as we celebrate this anniversary, we honor 50 years of innovation. We honor our values and we honor the individuals who helped build this company. We are also celebrating the future and the opportunity we have to build on our rich history and our values to shape this next chapter of our history and build a company that customers and employees can love and that richly rewards our shareholders, so happy anniversary, Best Buy. And now I am very happy to turn the call over to our new CFO, Corie Barry. Corie Barry : Thank you, Hubert and good morning everyone. I am excited to be on this, my first earnings call as the CFO of Best Buy. I want to take a moment to thank everyone in the Best Buy family for your confidence and continued commitment to our future. I am thrilled to be a part of this team and feel fortunate to be able to tell our collective story. I also want to take a moment to publicly thank Sharon McCollam for the active advisory role she is playing. Her wisdom and advice have been invaluable to me over the past 3.5 years and she has been instrumental in this transition. Finally, I want to think Hubert and our Board for this opportunity. I look forward to our collective partnership. Before I talk about our second quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.53 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by out-performance in the domestic and international businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.57 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to higher gross profit rates and the flow-through of the higher revenue in both businesses. The higher than expected gross profit rate in the domestic business was primarily driven by lower than expected negative impact from our investments in services, pricing and the impact of inventory availability in the high margin digital imaging category caused by the Japanese earthquakes in April. I will now talk about our Q2 results versus last year. On a constant currency basis, enterprise revenue increased 0.4% to $8.53 billion, primarily due to higher sales retention in Canada and comparable sales growth in the domestic business. On a reported basis, enterprise revenue increased 0.1%, reflecting approximately 30 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.08 or 16% to $0.57. This increase was primarily driven by Canada, which is lapping the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change and a $0.02 per share benefit from a lower tax rate. These increases were partially offset by the expected year-over-year pressure in the domestic business from one, our investment in services pricing. Two, lapping the periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio and an extended warranty deferred revenue adjustments. And three, the inventory availability impact from the Japanese earthquakes that I just mentioned. Collectively, these items resulted in approximately $0.08 of year-over-year pressure versus our expectation of $0.12 to $0.13. In our domestic segment, revenue increased a greater than expected 0.1% to $7.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales of 0.8%, which were partially offset by the loss of revenue from 12 large formats and 22 Best Buy mobile store closures since last year. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in health and wearables, home theater, major appliances and computing was offset by declines in mobile phones and gaming. In services, comparable revenue declined 7.2% due to investments in services pricing and the ongoing reduction of repair revenue, driven by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic comparable online revenue increased 23.7% to $835 million, primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.6% versus 8.6% last year. In our international segment, on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 4.1% to $644 million, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, international revenue declined 1%, reflecting approximately 510 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 24.2%. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 24%, primarily due to the net negative impact of approximately 20 basis points from lapping the periodic profit sharing benefit and the extended warranty deferred revenue adjustment in Q2 FY \u201816, investments in services pricing and the impact of inventory availability in the high margin digital imaging category caused by the Japanese earthquakes. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 300 basis points to 25.9%, primarily driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada as the company lapped the significant disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity related to the brand consolidation, which started in Q1 FY \u201816. Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.77 billion or 20.7% of revenue, a decrease of $24 million or 30 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.61 billion or 20.3% of revenue, a decrease of $18 million or 30 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by the flow-through of cost reductions, which were partially offset by strategic investments. International non-GAAP SG&A was $164 million or 25.5% of revenue, a decrease of $6 million or 70 basis points. This dollar decrease was primarily driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. From a cash flow perspective, we generated $1 billion in free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less cash used to fund additions to property and equipment during the first half of the year compared to $15 million for the first half of last year. While this is due to solid financial results and disciplined working capital management, it is also significantly influenced by the timing of inventory and payable positions. As a reminder, our decision last year to bring holiday inventory in early resulted in us holding inventory longer and having to settle accounts payable prior to year end. In Q1 and Q2 of this year, our accounts payable to inventory ratio has increased as expected. In the second quarter, we returned $309 million in cash to our shareholders, $219 million through share repurchases and $90 million in regular dividends. This brings our year-to-date total cash returned to over $640 million. Also, during the quarter, S&P returned our debt rating to investment grade. We are now rated investment grade by all three of the major rating agencies. I would now like to talk about our Q3 guidance and our full year outlook. For our Q3 fiscal 2017 guidance, we are expecting enterprise revenue in the range of $8.8 billion to $8.9 billion or flat to 1% growth. We anticipate both enterprise and domestic comparable sales growth of approximately 1%. We expect international revenue to be approximately flat to down 5% on a reported basis and to be approximately flat on a constant currency basis. We anticipate our Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.47 assuming a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 319 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 37.5% to 38%. As it relates to our full year financial outlook, we are reaffirming our expectation of approximately flat revenue and raising our full year non-GAAP operating income outlook. We continue to expect the slight revenue decline in the first half to be offset by slight growth in the back half. And in light of our first half performance, we are now expecting a full year non-GAAP operating income growth rate in the low single-digits versus our previous expectation of approximately flat. This includes lapping the significant periodic profit sharing benefits from our services plan portfolio that we earned in fiscal 2016. As we discussed on our previous earnings calls, our full year outlook assumes one, a relatively better mobile cycle; two, a trend in the NPD tracked categories consistent with the last two quarters; and three, delivering our cost reduction and gross profit optimization initiatives. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Your line is open. Dan Wewer : Good morning. I want to follow-up on the comments about the sales retention rate exceeding expectations in Canada. What do you think is contributing to that and if you could compare that experience to the sales retention rate in the U.S. following store closures? Hubert Joly : Good morning, Dan. We have strong retention rates in Canada, stronger than in the U.S. for the reason that as the two brands were built over time in Canada, you found many, many situations where the 2 stores, the Future Shop store and the Best Buy store were very close to each other, sometimes in the same parking lot. And so, of course, that\u2019s different from the store footprint in the U.S., so difficult to compare. As it relates to -- compared to our expectations, maybe our expectations were too low. But the other thing is that frankly our team is executing extremely well. And what the brand\u2019s consolidation has done is it has unlocked the ability of our teams to invest in the customer experience and great work for customers. As you know, Future Shop had a commission-based system in a multi-channel environment with the importance of online. This was limiting some of our abilities, and so great execution, kudos, really impressive performance on the part of our Canadian team. We have to give credit to where credit is due. Dan Wewer : And then this is a follow-up. There has been growing discussion about the average selling prices for 4K televisions dropping roughly 30% year-over-year, whether that\u2019s a benefit because it accelerates the adoption rate of that technology or if that\u2019s a headwind for our company such as Best Buy because of margin pressure. And then also your perspective on the growing assortment of 4K televisions at the discounters, and if -- whether or not that\u2019s a risk factor in the second half of the year? Hubert Joly : So, Dan, thank you for your question on this. Let me first say that our outlook for the rest of the year incorporates best forecast for this category as well as all of the other categories. There\u2019s always cycles from a product standpoint and price deflation in these categories. There is nothing new here. What is noteworthy is the superior customer experience that we have built around home theater. That\u2019s true in the stores from an assortment standpoint, from a merchandising standpoint, the ability to see, touch, and experience the products, the expertise that we now have in the stores in part in partnership with key vendors. All of this is very, very strong. And then we, of course, have online experience and our ability to help customers in the home. As you know, we will come to you to help design the right solution around your \u2013 in particular, your home theater needs. So, all of this has been driven our superior performance and again in terms of outlook, all of the factors you are laying out, price deflation, competition and so on and so forth is factored in our outlook for the back half of the year, and we know that there\u2019s cycles. Corie, anything you would like to add? Corie Barry : Yes, the only thing that I would add is Dan as you well know price compression in 4K TV is not a new phenomenon. That is a phenomenon that\u2019s been happening pretty strongly for the last eight quarters. And so to Hubert\u2019s point, we continue to factor that in, but the excitement and the accessibility that that drives for our customers is very exciting to us. And to underscore what Hubert said, our ability to really help people understand the differentiated experiences in 4K in a really unique way in our stores we see as a definite advantage for us. Dan Wewer : Right, thank you. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Dan. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will move next to Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Peter Keith : Hey, thank you. Good morning and congratulations on the good execution. I wanted to see if you could provide a little more color on the computing and mobile phone category. That was an area of outperformance from what we expected, and I guess, even thinking back to 2 years ago prior to the launch of the iPhone 6, that was a category that was under tremendous pressure. So surprising that you comped positive with a negative mobile dynamic, could you give us some insight on what\u2019s driving that and is that sustainable in that category? Hubert Joly : Thank you Peter for your kind words. So, our computing and phones, of course a different story. Phones, we anniversary still the comparison with a very strong phone launch, so as expected softness that we expect to reverse in the back half of the year. In computing, this is another great example of how in partnership with key vendors and with a very strong focus on the customer experience, we are able to lead a category and change the outcome for the category. I think 4K is the other example. This is a great example. The experience online, the experience in the store, our service capabilities, our ability to create a unique assortment, and again working closely with key vendors helped make us a key destinations and allow us to deliver a very strong customer experience leading to market share gains and great NPS scores. So, this is an illustration of when Best Buy has all of the functions working together, we can create \u2013 we can shape the outcome for ourselves, our customers and our vendors from a performance standpoint. So, you are right to highlight this strong performance. Thank you for your comments. Corie Barry : And Peter, one of the things that I would make sure that I add to that is that we definitely saw tablets was also a bit less bad than what we have seen sequentially in Q1. So, I think the computing story for us continues to be a very good story, but both tablets and mobile were slightly less down as what we have seen in Q1. So sequentially, that\u2019s a bit of what happened that highlighted that overarching category. Peter Keith : Okay, thank you very much. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Congratulations on nice quarter. Corie Barry : Thank you. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Brian. Brian Nagel : My question on the gross \u2013 I just have two questions together here. But on the gross margin side, we saw weakness in the domestic gross margin, where you laid out a number of seemingly one-timeish type factors. I guess the question is was there, to any extent, price promotions that impacted the domestic gross margins that may have helped the domestic comps? Corie Barry : Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. So we were very clear in calling out some of the very specific pressures to our business in the quarter, namely what we saw happening in services, both from a pricing perspective and from lapping last year\u2019s unique profit sharing benefit as well as some of the softness we expected in DI. I also just mentioned that we saw a quarter where tablets sequentially was not as low as what we had seen in the prior quarter and just the mix of that in our business creates a bit of a different profit profile. We have been very clear historically, we called it out I know in Q1 around our pricing and promotionality and we have been clear that we are working to be very targeted in where we are promotional and be very thoughtful about what the right drive times are and what the right events are for us. And so I characterize it less as massively more promotional in the quarter and more as a combination of some of these discrete events and a bit of a change in the mix of our business for the quarter. Brian Nagel : That\u2019s very helpful. Maybe second question if I could, with respect to the second half guidance and you mentioned in your prepared comments, Hubert you did as well the mobile phone launches, it\u2019s maybe kind of more qualitative statement, I mean to what extent do the mobile phone launches in some of the leading carriers or the manufacturers out there need to be successful in order to help your guidance? Hubert Joly : So I think we have been \u2013 we are explicit about this. Clearly, our outlook for the back half assumes a better, relatively better phone profile in the back half. This said, phone is not the only story. There is quite a bit of innovation excitement for customers. I said some words about virtual reality, but that\u2019s not the only one and of course, we are not here to announce new product launches for \u2013 on behalf of our vendors. But phone is a factor. It\u2019s not the only factor. And as you can feel from the outlook and our tone certainly, we think the back half is going to be pretty exciting from a product innovation and the consumer standpoint. Brian Nagel : Great. Congrats again. Thank you. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Dan Binder of Jefferies. Your line is open. Dan Binder : Thanks. I was wondering if you could comment at all on how the back-to-school, back-to-college season is doing for you. And just as a follow-on to the last question on innovation and product cycles, I was just curious, as you think about the holiday period, is virtual reality something that can actually be a needle mover this holiday or is it still too small, too high price? Hubert Joly : Yes. So thanks, Dan. Back-to-school, back-to-college is performing according to our expectations and of course is reflected in our outlook. As it relates to virtual reality, I mean candidly, this is an exciting new technology. The impact this year is going to be not material on our performance. We through the assortment and the demo stations that I talked about, we certainly do expect to be a destination for this and to have excitement with our customers. From a financial standpoint, limited impact early in the cycle, limited product availability and so forth, but excitement from a customer and store standpoint because this is yet another example of a product that if you want to learn about it, experience it, even though it says virtual reality, the reality is that you need to experience it physically to be able to see that virtual reality, but this is true. So thank you, Dan. Dan Binder : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from David Schick of Consumer Edge. Your line is open. David Schick : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My question is around the experimentation you talked about early in the call Hubert, around services, around in-store classes, what you have been able to do by partnering with the brands and the vendors have a better experience while controlling costs. As you think about these other initiatives that are going to play into the overall Best Buy experience, how are you working with or thinking about the brands in that experimentation around services or store classes, is it part of that thinking or is this purely Best Buy thought process and if so, how do you think through the ROI and things like that? Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you, David. Partnership with vendors continues to be a key pillar of our strategy. And the stores as well as our ability to go into people\u2019s homes are very unique assets that are highly valued by several of our vendors. And so as we explore and experiment, we are involving and we will be involving key vendors from that standpoint, it\u2019s not difficult to see how around classes, you would partner with key vendors as appropriate. So I think you are spot on. It continues to be a key pillar. I think it\u2019s premature to talk about the ROI on some of these investments. That\u2019s why we are talking about exploration and experimentation, but there is a lot of excitement from the customer standpoint around this experimentation as well as the vendors and the ability for us to demonstrate and really pursue this mission of helping customers pursue their passions and live their lives with the help of technology takes these kinds of new approaches. So hopefully shedding some light on what we are doing there, David. Corie Barry : And David, I think you are already starting to see some examples of whether it\u2019s specifically related to these initiatives or others of vendors partnering with us and looking for other areas of interest. We talked about Apple authorized service provider historically, and you will also see some very specific offerings that we provide on some of the high end merchandise around more white glove kind of delivery and service offerings. So I think that\u2019s where you are tangibly starting to see some of the value that we bring to the table, but done in partnership with some of our vendors in unique ways. And I think what Hubert is highlighting how we continued to evolve that in light of some of these more targeted strategic initiatives. David Schick : Thank you so much. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Brad Thomas of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Brad Thomas : Yes. Thank you and let me add my congratulations as well on a great execution here. My question is around the strong growth in online and just hoping to get your latest thoughts on where perhaps this 10% to 11% of sales ends up going over the medium and longer term and what your latest thoughts are on how that might affect the profitability of the company longer term? Thank you. Hubert Joly : So thank you for your kind words. The performance of online continues to be strong. We think about online in two ways; one is the channel itself and then the other digital experience and how it helps customers because most of the visits on that site actually result in sales in the stores or visits to the stores and then completing the transaction online. So it\u2019s quite intertwined. Projecting the percentage is going to be down the road of our business. It\u2019s not something we have done. The \u2013 there is a way to think about it, which is there is growth online, which is clearly fast, but I think our stores have a very strong role to play. So this is \u2013 we don\u2019t see it as a zero sum game. So I think that as we explore these growth opportunities, as we look at how to really help customers, we will see how we can best leverage each one of our assets. So I want apologize for not providing a direct answer to this question because it implies a zero sum game and that\u2019s not how we are thinking about it. We see growth opportunities, frankly across the business. Brad Thomas : Thank you. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Brad. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot and good morning. Looking at your domestic same-store sales against the NPD data, you disclosed \u2013 suggest that the gap has widened out in your favor in the second quarter after two quarters of narrowing share gains, so I am interested in where you think your share gains accelerated within the NPD categories or whether you think the improvement relative to that basket came from some of the categories that they don\u2019t measure? Corie Barry : Yes. Matt, this is Corie. So there were a few places and I actually mentioned one sequentially already where we saw a bit more strength than we have seen in Q1 and that was tablets. And we actually saw a bit of a trajectory change there versus Q1 in our business. And then a lot of the other categories, we just saw some of the continued strength that we have been seeing out of Q1, but it was really that tablets number that was one of the biggest trajectory changes for us in Q2. Matthew Fassler : And you think, Corie, that, that was relative to the market not just the category improvement? Corie Barry : No, it was relative to the market as well based on the information that we can see. Matthew Fassler : Great. And then just by way of quick follow-up, you called out I think as the first category in the press release in terms of domestic growth, the wearables and wellness business. And I know that some of the vendors have spoken with lots of excitement about new product rollouts in the second half of the year. I know it\u2019s still, I think, a fairly small business for you. So, can you kind of dimensionalize how important that was to the overall domestic comp and whether that can become even more important as you make your way to the second half? Corie Barry : Yes, absolutely, Matt. There was a reason we listed it first. It was very impactful overall to our business and again I think highlights a nice partnership for us. We are interested and excited and Hubert mentioned it already. The back half isn\u2019t just about phones. They are \u2013 we think there could be some interesting things on the horizon. So, we are watching just like you are to see what else there might be in the back half. But from a holiday perspective obviously, we like our positioning in the category. Hubert, I don\u2019t know if you have something to add? Hubert Joly : Yes, couple of things to add. Clearly, in health and wearables, I mean, we really don\u2019t get into products, but it\u2019s factual to remember that in Q2 of last year, we didn\u2019t have an iconic watch that was introduced during \u2013 more in August, so more in Q3. So, that\u2019s a factor, and of course, we are going to lap that in the second half. What I wanted to add is maybe to deemphasize the focus on the NPD tracked categories, because there is so many exclusions now that it\u2019s \u2013 what\u2019s convenient with the NPD report is that it\u2019s available when we report our earnings, but there is so many exclusions that it\u2019s hard to use it as a true spotlight for the performance. So, we have provided this again this quarter for convenience. Our real focus is actually on growing the top line more than anything else. So, I am just looking at that for now. Matthew Fassler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to talk a little bit more about the gross margin. A lot of the low hanging fruit that you have been able to harvest on the gross margin side just kind of already into the base, the gross margin here we should think about as just be inherently more volatile moving forward? More specifically, what are your gross margin expectations for the back half of the year? Corie Barry : Yes. So, Michael, I will do my best here. Obviously, we don\u2019t break out separately the margin and SG&A expectations. That being said, its part of the reason we were trying to be so clear on the individual drivers in Q2 is that many of them are kind of more structural or we have called them out individually as large kind of more one-time in nature. So, we have talked multiple times about the profit sharing. You will continue to see us lapping that in the back half. We are very clear last year about when we saw those different pockets. Additionally, the services pricing pressure, we start to lap the changes that we made to our services portfolio last year about midway through Q3 and so you are going to see that even out a bit. And so I think we have tried to be very clear about what are those structural pieces versus some of the underlying. And keep in mind, we also continued to work on from a waste reduction and efficiency perspective, remember that doesn\u2019t just impact our SG&A. That also continues to flow through portions of it in our margin line as well. And so yes, there are some puts and takes there, but we are trying to be very clear about what are kind of the larger events that we are lapping year-over-year versus some of the just more structural baselines. Michael Lasser : And then if I could add just a quick follow-up on the spread between your comp and the NPD category. It seems like you are calling out strength in share gains within a particular vendor when you mentioned tablets, you mentioned the wearables category. Do you think your share gains occurred mostly in \u2013 amongst the one particular vendor who coincidentally we heard like a particular weakness at another big box retailer during the quarter or was it more evenly spread across multiple vendors? Corie Barry : Yes. So to be clear, Michael, I want to make a couple of things. One, wearables in the way that we are talking about it is not included in the NPD tracked categories. So, that\u2019s not going to be a factor in NPD. Broadly when I had spoken about tablets that was more a trajectory change from Q1 to Q2, in total, what we saw was overarching continued share gains across the categories and inherently across our vendor portfolio as well. Michael Lasser : Okay, thank you so much. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Michael. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from David Magee of SunTrust. David Magee : Yes. Hi, everybody. Good morning. Hubert Joly : Good morning. David Magee : I wanted to ask about the services business and just noticing that the year-to-year declines are lessening sequentially and I think you all mentioned that it wasn\u2019t as much of a drag on gross margins as you thought it might be. So, the momentum is picking up. I am curious well, first of all, with regard to the gross margin drag, is that because of the vendor relationships? Is that why that\u2019s less of a drag? Corie Barry : So, to answer that one specifically, nope, that is not due to vendor relationships. That is a combination of our portfolio changes that we made and some of the better attach that we are seeing as well as continued tweaking of our portfolios to ensure we actually believe we are offering the best possible, most compelling offers for our customers. It is not vendor specific. David Magee : Okay. And then as you go into next year and just given that we are late in certain product cycles, do you expect that this momentum that you are seeing will continue with that category? Corie Barry : Yes. So, we commented in the release that we actually even expected in the back half for some of that year-over-year decline to abate, flatten out, if not add to growth, which is what we have been expecting. It\u2019s why we made the portfolio changes that we made. And then obviously, we continue to work as Hubert noted in the innovation space in the things that we are trying. We continue to look for new opportunities to grow the business as we head into next year. David Magee : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Joseph Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. Joseph Feldman : Hey, guys. It\u2019s Joe Feldman. Congratulations on the quarter. Wanted to ask a couple of questions, one of which was with the customers that are shopping the store today and obviously the trends are a little bit better, are you seeing new customers that are different from your everyday customer or are you seeing the same ones buying more? And effectively, I am trying to get a sense of like what the change in customer profile might look like if at all? Hubert Joly : Thank you for your question. It\u2019s \u2013 and customer focus is a key part of our strategy. So, I think as we look ahead, you will see us focus more and more in building these relationships, deepening the relationship with customers as we help them more deeply. As it relates to specifically your question where there is many things that are contributing to the strong performance, including attracting new customers. We have had good track record from that standpoint. In terms of deepening the relationship with customers, I think we have a lot of opportunities ahead of us, frankly. And even though we are a category leader, our market share in aggregate across all of the consumer technology spend is only in the teens. And even with our existing customers, our share of wallet is far from being exhaustive. So, I think we have opportunities there that we have not fully captured. So in summary, we have a good momentum with attracting new customers and having opportunities with deepening the relationship with existing customers. Joseph Feldman : Great, thanks. If I could ask one quick follow-up sort of unrelated, but on the appliances, you guys mentioned a number of changes that you are starting to make. Can you discuss that in a little more detail like the installation improvements I think it was in delivery improvements? And you said it had a little bit of disruption and I was wondering if you could quantify that in some way? Hubert Joly : Yes, so a couple of things. One, we have been on a journey and we have talked about it on several of our calls to improve the quality of service around delivery and installation. From an industry standpoint, by the way, this is an area that where there is a lot of opportunities and we have had a strong focus on that and the progress we have made in the last several quarters has been very, very notable achieving NPS scores that frankly we did not necessarily thought were possible even though quite \u2013 we are far from being where we want to be specifically then as it relates to this quarter. So, we introduced a change in our \u2013 we introduced the ability of the customer to choose the narrower delivery window, like 4 hours at the point of sales both in stores and online and specifically \u2013 so, that\u2019s obviously a great benefit from a customer standpoint. Who wants to sit around and wait for the entire day for the appliance to show up, I think we can do a survey on this call, probably no one. And so we are narrowing the delivery window and the ability of the customer to choose. In the very short-term, this has led to disruptions. Sometimes, when you introduce innovation, there are some kinks to be worked out. So we are in the process of working them out. We have highlighted that because the growth rate of our appliance business in the quarter of roughly 8% was slower than some of what was still 23 quarters of consecutive comp sales growth, but relatively slower than what we have seen before. I think if we have not had these disruption so okay, so probably we would have been in the double-digits growth rate and we do expect looking ahead that these continued improvements and again we have a long way to go in terms of creating an amazing customer experience for when you buy \u2013 when you shop for and then buy and use appliances that this is going continue to drive our performance. Joseph Feldman : Got it. Thanks. Good luck with this quarter. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Joe. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Your line is open. Alan Rifkin : Thank you very much and congratulations on a nice quarter. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Alan. Alan Rifkin : My first question is as you continue to roll out the store within stores, whether it\u2019s LG or Samsung, Sony, Oculus, collectively, what proportion of your revenues do these store in store businesses now represent? Hubert Joly : Well, that\u2019s a \u2013 yes, do you want to take that? Corie Barry : Yes, I will take that. Thanks Alan. We haven\u2019t specifically talked about performance of our store in stores. And frankly, almost like the online channel, it\u2019s a little difficult to break out exactly what\u2019s attributable to that store and that experience and that vendor. Obviously, we have vendor presences across all of our stores. We like however, obviously and I think Hubert hit on it, especially as it relates to Oculus as an example, that ability for us to showcase a technology in a very unique way and our vendor partners coming with us on that road. So that\u2019s why you continue to see us and you continue to see vendors want to partner with us in those experiences. So while we haven\u2019t called out the specific proportion of revenue related to those experiences, we continued to be pleased with offering the customer that kind of visibility and experience in our stores. Hubert Joly : Let me add something Alan, to your question. The stores within a store are very important component of our strategy. And as Corie said, like online, it\u2019s hard to isolate because what we are is much more than a collection of stores within a store. From the customers standpoint, as customers look for solutions around their entertainment needs, their food preparation needs, their productivity needs, their home automation needs, the reality is that you need usually to assemble a solution that takes from various vendors. And the role that Best Buy plays is certainly to showcase the latest and greatest technology and we show customers of the ability to run about it and experience it, but it\u2019s much more than this. It\u2019s also to understand the needs of the customer and create a solution that meets their needs and there is an integration need or value added that exists there. And therefore that makes it difficult to track or not necessarily meaningful to track the performance of individual stores because of that more a crosscutting solution selling approach. I hope that\u2019s helpful Alan to your understanding. Alan Rifkin : That is. Thank you very much. And I do have a follow-up, if I may. In your guidance, you had said that the charge would be $0.12 to $0.13 related to the Japanese earthquake and the services pricing investment and the profit sharing payment and that charge came out to be $0.08, so I was curious where the delta of $0.13 really came from the within those three variables? Corie Barry : Yes. There were two main places that were a little bit better than we thought. One was, as we mentioned, the services pricing, where we both saw a little bit better attach and made some changes to our portfolios that were accepted well by our customers. And then the second was some of the disruption expectations around inventory supply, where we saw our customers just make some different choices in terms of demand and what they wanted to purchase. Those were the two biggest drivers. Alan Rifkin : Okay. Thank you very much. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Alan. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next question from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Seth Sigman : Thanks. Good morning. Nice quarter guys. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Seth. Corie Barry : Thank you. Seth Sigman : So I wanted to follow-up on the services business and the guidance for flat to slightly positive in the second half of the year, I know you are lapping some price changes, but would seem to imply that maybe transactions stabilize if not maybe improve, is that something that you are already seeing, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the responses that you have seen so far to the changes you made last year, how attachment rates are trending, etcetera? Thanks. Corie Barry : Yes. So Seth, the response to the portfolio teams we made have been positive. We have seen improvement in attach rates in those categories. Now as expected, those improved attach rates haven\u2019t been enough to completely offset the price investment. Hence, the reason we have been calling it out as a piece of the pressure is on gross profit. But that being said, what we like is that we start to lap making that investment. We like the trend of the business that we have seeing heading into the back half. Hubert Joly : So I think this concludes our call and I want to thank you, of course for your attention. I will not hide from you that I am and the company was very proud of the accomplishments of our teams during the quarter and we are excited about our prospects in the back half. And of course, we look forward to speaking with you in November. Have a great day. Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s Best Buy\u2019s Q2 fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. You may all now disconnect your lines. And everyone have a great day.",

Welcome to Best Buy\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 :00 AM Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O\u2019Brien: Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Corie Barry, our CFO. This morning\u2019s conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings release we issued this morning. Today\u2019s release and conference call both contain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, which should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com. Today\u2019s earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. In today\u2019s earnings release and conference call, we refer to NPD-tracked categories. The categories tracked by the NPD Group, includes TVs, desktop and notebook computers, tablets, digital imaging and other categories. Sales of these products represent approximately 63% of our domestic revenue. It does not include mobile phones, appliances, services, gaming, Apple Watch, movies, music or Amazon branded products. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll begin today with a review of our third quarter performance and then provide an overview of the progress we are making against our fiscal 2017 priorities before turning the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. We\u2019re pleased to report, today, growth on both our top and bottom lines with enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion, an increase of 1.4% and non-GAAP EPS increasing 51% from $0.41 last year to $0.62 this year. These results were due to the strong performance in both our domestic and international segments. In our domestic business, we delivered comparable sales growth of 1.8%. This was on top of comparable sales growth of 0.8% last year. We saw continued positive momentum in our online channel, delivering their third straight quarter of 24% revenue growth. From an overall merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales growth in home theatre, mobile, and emerging categories like wearables and connected home. This was offset by continued softness in gaming. We also continued to drive considerable year-over-year improvement in our net promoter score, which increased approximately 400 basis points over Q3 last year. In our international business, revenue grew 4% on a constant currency basis. On a reported basis, international revenue increased 3.3%. Altogether, we have delivered another strong quarter, which reflects the strength of our value proposition and our execution. And I want to thank all of our associates for their dedication and hard work in achieving these results. I am and I hope they are proud of what they\u2019ve accomplished. Now before I go into more details on our third quarter performance, I would like to address the recent highly publicized product recalls in mobile phones and appliances. As you would expect, it did have a negative impact on the third quarter, particularly during October. We expect the magnitude of the impact to be more material in the fourth quarter, as the impact will be on the entire quarter in Q4 versus only a part of the quarter in Q3. As we looked at our revenue guidance, we had to incorporate the fact that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally planned. The expected impact of these recalls in our fourth-quarter domestic revenue is approximately $200 million. With that incorporated, we\u2019re planning to deliver comparable sales in the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. Still, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS to increase by 6% to 9% versus last year. Now, I\u2019d like to update you on the third quarter progress against our fiscal 2017 priorities. The first priority is to build on our industry position and multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing business. We\u2019re pleased with our progress here as we\u2019re driving growth across multiple areas of our business. In home theatre, we continued to grow sales and market share due to the strength of our Magnolia design centers, continued success of our vendor experiences and strong performance online. We believe we have built a market-leading customer experience around home theatre and large screen TVs, based on our assortment, our merchandising, our online experience, the expertise of our in-store sales associate and of course, ability to help customers in the home. The combination of new technology and declining ASPs has been driving growth and interest in the TV category. We offer a unique experience in assortment to our customers including 4K ultra Hi-Definition televisions with high dynamic range, OLED televisions and a variety of other emerging technologies. Also, our strategy at Best Buy is not just about selling TVs. It is about helping customers with their entertainment needs, driving growth in audio, streaming devices and other accessories, as well as delivery and installation. We are excited about the continued television product innovation being introduced to the market. And we believe advances in picture quality, content availability and smart home integration will continue to drive excitement and demand in the industry. This plays to our strengths as the technology and service leader in the category. We also delivered revenue growth during the quarter in the mobile category. As expected, new product launches stimulated demand during the quarter. This growth was partially offset by the well publicized issues with the Samsung Note 7, which has been recalled and is no longer being produced or sold. As a result, the mobile category performed better than last year but not as strong as our expectations heading into the quarter. Our strategy to win in this category is, in part, focus on our ability to be an advocated for every phone owner. Our Blue Shirts have the tools and training to analyze customers\u2019 current phone plans and their actual needs and then recommend the right plan at the right cost. We can also recommend hardware upgrades, add family members to existing plans, and create entirely new family plans. Using these tools, we have found that at least 50% of customers are able to save money on their monthly mobile plan. Also we\u2019ve increased our AT&T and Verizon stores within the store to 426 from 247 at the end of last year. In support of our strategy, these vendor experiences feature highly trained specialists who provide access to the carrier\u2019s products, services and detailed customer information, and the ability to learn about a wide set of connected or smart devices. We also drove growth in several emerging product categories. We are as excited as ever about the role that technology can play in people\u2019s lives, and the opportunity this creates for us. Emerging categories are gaining traction in part due to our ability to physically showcase products and offer expert help to customers. In connected home, we\u2019re seeing strengths in home automation including security, lighting, and video monitoring. Drones are also becoming a more meaningful part of the business and virtual reality products hit all of our stores during the third quarter with new, dedicated virtual reality departments in more than 700 stores. These new departments will offer demonstrations, virtual reality products, PC gaming devices and accessories. Since we first began offering install demos, customers have experienced approximately 300,000 virtual reality demos at Best Buy. In appliances, we leverage our 203 specific kitchen and home stores within the store and ongoing market share gains to deliver our 24th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. We reported 3% comparable sales growth this quarter on top of 16.4% in Q3 of last year. Our growth decelerated late in the quarter due in part to product recalls and shipping delays that resulted in constrained inventory with key vendors. In services as expected, our comparable sales trend improved significantly in the third quarter as we began to lap the pricing investments made last year and we are seeing higher attach rates and revenue growth from new products we introduced. In addition, we continue to drive improvements in our service quality and increased our net promoter score. We expect comparable sales in our services business to be slightly positive in the fourth quarter. Turning to our digital channel. We delivered our third consecutive quarter of 24% domestic online sales growth. This growth was driven by increased traffic and the cumulative benefit of our investments over the past few years in the digital customer experience and enhanced dot-com capabilities. We continue to refine our search, research, and checkout capabilities with a focus on streamlining the customer experience across all channels. For example, a new feature that can filter product search results by local store availability is resonating with customers as it makes their shopping journey a little easier. In addition to help customers after their purchase, we\u2019re piloting product support pages, which provide customers information about the products they\u2019ve purchased including transaction details, product specs, Geek Squad plans and quick access to expert help. We also launched a pilot in the Best Buy mobile app that allows customers to book 30 minute in-person appointments to consult with Blue Shirt experts. In our physical stores, we\u2019ve continued the momentum from the investments we\u2019ve made in training and coaching from the reduced employee turnover that we discussed last quarter. Heading into the holiday season and the fourth quarter, we have armed an increasing number of associates with tablets that allow them to look at product and customer information and transact. Also, we invested additional labor around key holiday product categories where customers need more help and in the fast growing in-store pick up area. In our international business, we recorded strong top and bottom line results in both Canada and Mexico. In Canada, we are seeing positive early results from the new store redesigns we have developed in partnership with key vendors. And we are also pleased with the growth of our services business there and excited by the lessons we are learning as a result. I\u2019ll now turn to our second fiscal 2017 priority, which is to reduce cost and drive efficiencies throughout the business. As it relates to our Renew Blue Phase 2 target of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2018, we achieved another $50 million in the third quarter. This brings our current total to $300 million in annualized cost reductions and gross profit optimization. As a result of our successful focus on driving out cost, we are able this year to improve the customer experience while maintaining flat SG&A. Our third fiscal 2017 priority is to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. We intend to be the company that makes it easy for customers to learn about and enjoy the latest technology as they pursue their passions and take care of what is important to them in their lives. With our combination of digital, store, and in-home assets, we believe we have a great opportunity to address key customer pin points, build stronger ongoing relationships with our customers, and unleash growth opportunities. As we\u2019ve stated before, fiscal 2017 is a year of exploration and experimentation. And we are testing several concepts across \u2013 around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. Based on early results, we\u2019ve expanded both the in-home advisor program and the Geek Squad on-demand pilots to additional markets. The in-home advisor program pilot involves a free in-home consultation with an experienced technology advisor who can identify our customers\u2019 needs, design a personalized solution and become a personal resource over time. Our Geek Squad on-demand pilots provide services to customers who need immediate technology help or advice including same day. We also recently launched a new program called Magnolia Care to provide ongoing support and troubleshooting for the comprehensive custom home theatre solutions we provide to our Magnolia Design Center clients. Also in Canada, we\u2019re testing a new service called Geek Squad Home Membership that provides support for all of the technology products that customer may own regardless of whether they were bought at Best Buy. On the connected home front, we are testing different merchandising concepts like creating displays with actual front door experiences to demonstrate front door security solutions. So in summary, we are excited by the continued industry product innovation we\u2019re seeing, the role we play for customers, the growth opportunities in front of us, the quality of our execution, and the strengths of our financial performance. Looking ahead, our teams are ready to execute our plan for the holiday season. As our marketing tagline, Holiday Gifting Made Easy, states, our goal is to make holiday shopping effortless for customers. To win holiday and deliver on this promise, we have created an exciting assortment of great and competitively priced products, and we have mobilized our assets, including our leading-edge digital capabilities, fast and free shipping across the entire site during holiday, and of course our knowledgeable Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents who are here to provide compelling in-store experiences and in-home services. And so in closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our associates and their families for everything they will do this holiday to delight our customers. I say to our associates, you are Best Buy, and I appreciate you very, very much. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry. Corie Barry : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. Enterprise revenue of $8.95 billion exceeded our expectations, driven by out-performance in the domestic and international businesses. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 also exceeded our expectations, primarily due to higher gross profit rates in both businesses and lower than expected SG&A in the domestic business. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. On a constant currency basis, enterprise revenue increased 1.5% to $8.95 billion, primarily due to comparable sales growth in the domestic business and the continuation of the strong performance we\u2019ve seen in international throughout this year. On a reported basis, enterprise revenue increased 1.4%, reflecting approximately 10 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.21 or 51% to $0.62. This increase was primarily driven by one, a higher gross profit rate and the flow through of higher revenue in the domestic business; two, a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and three, Canada, which as of the end of Q3 has now lapped the disruptive impact from the brand consolidation last year. In our domestic segment, revenue increased a greater than expected 1.3% to $8.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.8%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from 14 large formats and 23 Best Buy mobile store closures. Industry sales in the NPD-tracked categories, which don\u2019t include categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 3.1%. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in home theatre, mobile phone, wearables, and connected home was partially offset by declines in gaming. In services, the comparable revenue decline of 1.8% moderated as expected as we have now lapped the investments in services pricing from last September. This decline in services revenue during the quarter was entirely due to the ongoing reduction of repair revenue driven primarily by lower frequency of claims on extended warranties. Domestic online revenue of $881 million increased 24.1% on a comparable basis primarily due to increased traffic, higher average order values, and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased 200 basis points to 10.8% versus 8.8% last year. In our international segment on a constant currency basis, revenue increased 4% to $753 million driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. On a reported basis, international revenue increased 3.3% reflecting approximately 70 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 24.6%. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 60 basis points due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theatre categories, which were partially offset by the mobile category. Unlike Q2 of this year, we did not see year-over-year pressure on our gross profit rate from the investments in services pricing or a periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 190 basis points to 24.3% driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to a more favorable product mix and lapping the disruption and corresponding increased promotional activity last year related to the brand consolidation. Now turning to SG&A, enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $1.88 billion or 21% of revenue, an increase of $18 million; however, the enterprise revenue increase resulted in leverage of 10 basis points. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.71 billion or 20.9% of revenue, an increase of $20 million. This increase was primarily driven by the timing of previously outlined investments. International non-GAAP SG&A was $169 million or 22.4% of revenue, a decline of $2 million driven by the positive impact of foreign exchange rates. The 110 basis points of SG&A rate decline were driven by sales leverage. In the third quarter, we returned $290 million in cash to our shareholders, $201 million through share repurchases and $89 million in regular dividends. This brings our year-to-date total cash return to over $931 million. I would now like to talk about our fourth quarter guidance. For the fourth quarter, as we execute our holiday plans, which includes a disciplined promotional strategy, we expected to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.62 to $1.67 compared to $1.53 last year. This outlook assumes a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 315 million and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate in the range of 35% to 35.5%. Note that our revenue and EPS expectations include approximately $30 million or $0.06 of net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio that we received in the fourth quarter of last year. From a revenue standpoint, we are excited by the rate of technology innovation, the quality of our assortment, and our ability to execute. As Hubert said earlier, we also need to factor in our projections the impact of recent product recalls that happened in the last few months, and that certain products will simply not be available for sale during our fourth quarter as originally expected. The impact of the recalls on Q4 is expected to be approximately $200 million. With this incorporated, our enterprise revenue expectation is $13.4 billion to $13.6 billion. Underlying our enterprise performance is domestic comparable sales in the range of negative 1% to positive 1% and international comparable sales in the range of negative 2% to positive 2%. Lastly, I want to take one final opportunity to remind everyone that as we announced earlier this year, we will no longer be doing a holiday sales release in early January due to the growing importance of that month to our Q4 financial results. We look forward to talking to you in February on our Q4 call. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Matthew McClintock. Please go ahead. Matthew McClintock : Hi, yes. Great quarter, everyone. Congratulations. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Matthew McClintock : I was [indiscernible] be for a second. Home theatre outstanding results during the quarter, seems like there\u2019s been a proliferation of 4K TV skews and maybe lower demographic channels or lower price point channels, the value channel. And I was just wondering, how do you see the competitive dynamics of 4K TVs playing out especially as we enter the peak holiday season this year, thank you. Hubert Joly : Thank you for your question, Matt. So the TV category is playing out pretty much as we expected. There is indeed a reduction of ASPs and the combination of reduced ASPs and great product is stimulating unit demand and in that context, I don\u2019t want to talk so much about the competitors, but I can talk about us. The customer experience we provide combination of assortment, merchandising, the online experience and experience in the stores, our service capabilities is allowing us to continue to gain market share. These market share gains have slightly moderated, because it doesn\u2019t continue forever but we\u2019ve built a capability that\u2019s quite unique. The other thing that we want to highlight and we\u2019ve talked about it on previous calls, the cycle of this time is different from the time where TVs went to digital and it was a much more contained cycle. We see continued product innovation today and coming in the future and this continued product innovation allows us to appeal to the type of customers that we appeal to which are in part the leading edge and early adopters, provide this great experience and allows us to stay ahead of the game. So we aren\u2019t surrendering by any stretch of the imagination. I think there\u2019s been some words around us we\u2019re \u2013 in the game to win and we\u2019re very proud of the capabilities we have. Corie Barry : And Matt, I would just add as you can hear in our prepared remarks, it\u2019s not just about the 4K cycle but because we supply solutions and the more full experience particularly in some of the vendor experience shops, we also see a very nice halo to the accessories like streaming devices like audio, within the category as well. Operator : And we will take our next question from Scott Mushkin. Please go ahead. Mr. Mushkin, please check the mute function on your phone. Scott Mushkin : Hey guys, sorry about that. The mute button on. And thanks for taking my questions. So I guess first kind of housekeeping item. The loss of $200 million in revenues is that about a nickel to EPS as we look at the fourth quarter is that a good approximation? Corie Barry : Yes. We are not going to translate it all the way down into profit at this point. So\u2026 Scott Mushkin : Okay. And then the second question not housekeeping is just because what Corie was talking about a little bit in the efforts in 2017. You guys are now starting to see comp accelerate a little bit. Are we \u2013 are you going to be able to outside of what you think like TV cycles and other things maintain a better comp stance given I\u2019m talking over multi-quarter year type of look given some of the changes you\u2019re bringing to the business? Is that kind of the goal here as you look out 2017 and 2018? Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you, Scott. Clearly today we aren\u2019t providing any guidance for next year or the following year. But as you have heard us talk about, one of our key priorities this year is to find ways to accelerate our growth. We believe that from the standpoint of all of the stakeholders including our shareholders, if we are able to accelerate our growth in a profitable way, this creates a different outcome. And we believe that we are in an opportunity rich environment by focusing on the underlying needs of our customers and creating this better customer experiences and providing solutions and services to them, we do believe we have opportunities. We\u2019re taking the time to explore and experiment this year, we\u2019ve shared with you a few of the things we are exploring but I have no doubt, a key area of focus for our Management team and all of our associates every day is to grow the Company. So without providing any guidance I can share with you that we\u2019re very focused on that while continuing to drive efficiencies to drive the investments in the future. So no guidance but a very clear focus as we look ahead, as we discussed, as we are beginning this year. Operator : And we will take our next question from Mike Baker. Please go ahead. Mike Baker : Thanks. Just a couple on the mobile category. First, so as it relates to the recall, what you typically \u2013 what have you seen this quarter and what do you think you\u2019ll see? Do people just hold off on buying if they were interested Samsung, do they just hold off and buying a phone or do they replace it with another phone and then related to that it seems like you got a bump from the iPhone 7 launch. Typically how long does the bump from a new successful iPhone launch last? Is that a couple quarters? Is that into next year until you lap it? Thanks. Hubert Joly : Yes, thank you for your question. So on the Note 7, it\u2019s early to say. We do see a fair bit of brands and Operating Systems and size loyalty and so the customers are not rushing to buy something else at this point in time so we\u2019ll see how it evolves during the quarter but this is a pretty much hold your breath kind of a situation for many of these customers, you want to take the iPhone 7, Corie? Corie Barry : Yes, on the iPhone, we are actually seeing a pretty much just in line with what our expectations were. If you recall we kind of said we didn\u2019t think it would be quite the bang of an iPhone 6 nor quite the slowness that we saw last year somewhere in between and that\u2019s a little bit of what we are seeing. To your question about how long does the trend last it\u2019s a little tricky, remember we talked a bit about single skew and the ability to buy the phone across multiple carriers that means we add a better supply of inventory, add more inventory that is available for customers, so that means quicker sell through early on. And so we\u2019re watching it now to look at the trends that implies going out. We like where the trends are holding up right now and typically as we watch the cycle it obviously tails as you go through the year, but it usually when people want the phone it\u2019s a cycle that continues. So again, we are not going to quite provide guidance into next year, but it tends to be a cycle that continues over time as people replace their phones. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Horvers. Please go ahead. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to follow-up on the product recall and availability issues that you mentioned. Can you frame out what you thought the revenue impact was to the third quarter? Is it all Samsung and is it all mobile and appliances and then following up on the earlier question, it sounds like you\u2019re saying there\u2019s very little substitution across brands, which if something breaks particularly on the appliance side, the rule of thumb is that two-thirds of demand is sort of failure or repair driven. So just trying to frame out the components how much it impact third quarter, what\u2019s your estimate between mobile and appliances and then thinking about the substitution aspect. Corie Barry : Yes. So in the third quarter like we said the impact was a little bit less materially less than what we\u2019re seeing in Q4. We thought the total amount of the impact was probably around $60 million that was heavily weighted toward mobile, much lighter on the appliance side of things. To your question about you kind of elaborate on the replacement cycle, Hubert had started on it. The truth is yes, there is definitely a repair aspect, but the phone still can be repaired. And if you are quite loyal to both the Operating System and the size of your phone, which we are seeing people be loyal to then you might be more willing to go through some of the repair work and wait for whatever else might be coming. So we actually are seeing a ton of people move into other devises. It seems like people are pretty loyal to that combination of Operating System and size that\u2019s offered and was offered by the Note. Hubert Joly : In case to elaborate, as Corie said the vast majority is on sounds to your question about appliances, people replacing the product after a failure, you are absolutely right on that front that the percentage of the missed sales is quite, is relatively small in appliances. Okay. Chris Horvers : Understood. And then so maybe just following up on the appliances comp in the third quarter, the growth rate has decelerated pretty sharply and listening to Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s this week they both had very good quarters in appliances. So are you more heavily weighted to brands that were dislocated because the shipping issues or is there pressure coming in from J.C. Penney, how would we think about your market share trends there? Thank you. Hubert Joly : Yes, thank you. The latest data we have from a market share standpoint go to September. So we don\u2019t have October. As of September based on the data we have \u2013 we continue to gain market share materially. And yes, we are more weighted towards the Korean brands in appliances. Chris Horvers : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Simeon Gutman. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Thanks, good morning. Hubert, going back to I think it was the first question on the TVs, can you share with us what you are anything directional on your premium versus non-premium business, because I think the battle is being waged maybe on the non-premium side. So if you can give us context of where your business sits and how is that evolving? Is the business mix evolving more towards or less from premium? And then just as part of that can you also talk about computers? I don\u2019t think it was called out maybe I missed it in the remarks, but there was a resurgence. I\u2019m curious how that\u2019s going, it\u2019s a pretty big category and curious how you think about it into the fourth quarter? Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you, Simeon. So on TVs, if you breakdown the industry in our business by TV size, you\u2019ll see a very different picture and this is an important point to highlight because it\u2019s not just about 4K\u2019s and OLED TVs it\u2019s very much about large screen TVs. And the customer demand is gravitating of course towards the larger screen TVs and the competitive landscape is different by TV size. So our customers and the experience we provide allows us to gravitate towards the higher \u2013 the larger screens and more fully featured TVs and not just 4K\u2019s, again this new innovation with HDR and OLED, so that is playing to our strength, so that dynamic is helping us, okay. And in a sense we also create \u2013 helping to create the dynamics is our merchandising efforts, our online efforts, our in-store efforts is allowing us to create that excitement about this more fully featured larger screen TVs. I think computing remains very important strength for us and this is another case where the industry is now doing great frankly from a top line standpoint. And combination of the assortments the creation of a premium more fully featured exclusive assortment on the Windows side and our strong presence with Apple, the great experience in the stores in partnership with our key vendors has really made us a great destination, great customer experience, great market share and evolution of the market. So this is a case where in partnership with our vendors and everything we can do we are helping to drive the market and a better outcome. So these are exciting categories. And looking at Q4, from a demand standpoint, there\u2019s potential excitement with both existing categories and then of course these new emerging categories because of course there\u2019s ways of growth and there is indeed this year quite a bit of innovation. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Melich. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. Congrats on a great quarter. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Greg. Greg Melich : I guess I had two questions. One I would just start with, the last few questions were all about how you guys are really winning with more premium product and the whole experience and offering. And so I guess I\u2019d ask the question from a different way, which is if you were to look at the whole store in that 1.8 comp, if you could help us get a sense of how much of that is transaction count growth versus an ability to expand the basket or the ticket with customers by selling them a whole home theatre as opposed to just a TV and then I had a follow-up. Corie Barry : Yes, so on that one, I think when we look at the store what we\u2019re most pleased with is our ability to offer the more premium products and the bigger solutions and the other products that go with it. Obviously from a traffic perspective, we\u2019ve continued to see consistent performance in the stores with obviously a traffic pick up online. And so where we are seeing a lot of the benefit in the store side is definitely around that ability to provide the more premium product and then that product surrounded by a much more fulsome experience that\u2019s really supported by some of that expertise that we\u2019ve been talking about in our stores. Greg Melich : So I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but it sounds like traffic trends to the store are unchanged, but the improvement has been once you get someone there you\u2019re selling them a fuller package and then online growth as well helping that? Hubert Joly : And of course Greg, online we do have a traffic growth 24% is very robust. And yes, the trends you\u2019re highlighting are very much in line with our strategy and focus of our teams. We have such a rich set of opportunities to provide solutions to our customers, once they are in a stores, we need to take care of their needs and it\u2019s both the basket that\u2019s an opportunity, but also the share of wallet I think that\u2019s building these relationship with their customers helping them over time and becoming a resourceful is another set of opportunities. So these are very exciting opportunities ahead of us. Greg Melich : Yes. Maybe Corie, you mentioned something how the markets changed, now you saw more people getting streaming and audio systems attached. Are there any metrics you can provide of that versus like five years ago, where I don\u2019t know a third of TVs have a surround sound and it used to be 20% or anything? Corie Barry : I\u2019m probably not going to provide metrics at this point. But suffice it to say, I mean, obviously when you think about five years ago streaming was a little baby and it\u2019s come a long ways since then and obviously as the TV has gotten thinner you have absolutely zero sound quality associated with those TV is not there but it\u2019s difficult for you to get any sound out of a very, very beautiful thin, lightly bazel panel. And so I think it\u2019s the evolution of technologies naturally lended itself to adding in some of these other experiences. I mean, obviously we don\u2019t want anyone to go home and not love their home theatre system. And so we\u2019re trying to find ways to make sure they understand up front, look you may not feel like you\u2019re getting the full experience when you get home without something to help you on the audio side. So I think that it\u2019s not only what we are doing, it also, you kind of are watching technology trends that lend themselves [indiscernible] this continued evolution that lends itself to a more complete experience. Greg Melich : And then just on the guidance, just to make sure I\u2019m backing it right, gross margins are expected to be down just a little bit in the fourth quarter, if I\u2019ve put in everything? Corie Barry : No, actually I\u2019d say probably something that looks more like flattish to up maybe to fittest. Greg Melich : Okay. Thanks a lot. Good luck. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Greg. Operator : And we will take our next question from David Schick. Please go ahead. David Schick : Hi. Add my congratulations, not only on the results but on the engagement level in stores, the energy level, I know we\u2019ve talked about it before, but in the retail industry it\u2019s exciting to see it in the stores. Hubert Joly : Thank you so much David. Goes to our heart, thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. David Schick : My question is this, so the share gains have continued and compounded. And as you say, at some point they can\u2019t keep accelerating but they can stay there to some extent. I guess, how does the compounding really of the conversation or the work with the vendors go? So I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t talk specifics, but as you\u2019ve become more and more important in the way that they develop new products, that they introduce new products, that they talk to customers, I mean, how is the conversation different with the vendors than maybe broadly than 18 months ago or 36 months ago? I think that would be helpful to think about the evolution of the sector. Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you, David. Clearly these vendor partnerships partnering with our key vendors has been a big part of the story of Best Buy forever, but certainly in the last four years. If anything we\u2019re deepening these partnerships, as we focus on solving problems for customers and providing solutions, we are adding a services dimension to these discussions. So that we can provide an end-to-end seamless experience and support to customers. So that\u2019s an area we are exploring this, I can talk about specifics here because we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s an infomercial opportunity and we are a service provider \u2013 authorized service provider and we have a pilot with Samsung on in store repair for the phones and the tablets. And so again providing \u2013 if you have a Samsung product we\u2019re the only place where you can actually go to get this and of course Apple has go their own stores, but we have a very significant footprint. Also collaboration upstream in product design is something that is a great capability that we have and we are able to work with some key vendors upstream together create a winning strategy for our coming customers. And so being a player, in the North American market is such an important market for these vendors and Best Buy being a leading edge player in that creates a unique opportunity to create something very compelling for customers so these are some of the developments and as you can see they are pretty exciting. Corie Barry : I think one just last piece I\u2019d add is you continue to see especially in the emerging categories our ability to showcase experiences. We talked about VR and the 300,000 visits to experience VR. We\u2019ve talked about kind of our working on creating some of those Connected Home Solutions you can actually experience what those things do for you. I think that\u2019s where you continue to see our vendor partners interested and what we provide uniquely in our stores. David Schick : Thank you, so much. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Peter Keith. Please go ahead. Peter Keith : Hey, thanks a lot and great quarter. Corie Barry : Thank you. Peter Keith : Corie, hoping you could comment a little bit on the gross margin drivers for Q3? With better margins in home theatre and computing, I\u2019m guessing some of that is better attach. But could you maybe give us little more specifics? And is that a dynamic that you think can carry forward into the next couple of quarters? Corie Barry : Yes, so let\u2019s talk about gross profit a little bit. So what we saw in both home theatre and computing is really reflective of a little bit of what Hubert hit on, which is around kind of our mix, our assortment, our merchandising strategies and then absolutely to the last part of your question, some of that ability to have the basket due to the sales expertise that we have in our stores. Additionally, we talked about our ability to take out cost especially around some of our reverse logistics and we\u2019re also seeing some of that benefit our profit rates there. That however, was also offset by a little bit of a decline in the mobile category where we also have some mix challenges there. The other thing that I would note is as you compare to the second quarter and you think sequentially about what\u2019s happened in profit, we did not see material pressure from the investments in services pricing or the periodic profit share benefit. And so you kind of took those pressures away and then saw this bit better results around some of that mix and assortment. And it was very helpful to our overall margin rate. And then in terms of your question about do we see some of this going forward. That obviously, we have confidence in our expertise and our strategies and merchandising elements. I always, I\u2019m thoughtful around Q4 which is such a very different competitive quarter than the rest of the year. And so the guidance that we are giving you incorporates where we think we\u2019re positioned to provide the very best value and very best experiences to our customers. And then also obviously Q4 you have to take into account what I hit on before which is the 25 basis points of pressure from that periodic profit share lapping from last year. Peter Keith : Okay. Thank you very much and good luck with the holiday. Corie Barry : Thank you. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brian Nagel. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Hubert Joly : Good morning. Brian Nagel : Very nice quarter, congratulations. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Brian. Corie Barry : Thank you. Brian Nagel : So the question I wanted to ask just on the holiday. In your comments here, I think it\u2019s fair to say you sound pretty constructive as we head into this holiday season. The questions I have and I\u2019ll lump them together, to what extent \u2013 as you look at either your promotional plans or maybe what you\u2019ve seen from competitors, does that seem more subdued or rational than prior years? And then to what extent does maybe the spreading out, the de-emphasizing of Black Friday help to give you confidence that we lower the risk of maybe some irrational behavior out there? Then the final question with that, is there a product \u2013 I know we talked a lot about TVs and other categories, but is there a product that you think will really help to drive the holiday season this year? Thanks. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Brian for the question so is the promotional environment this year likely to be more subdued, short answer is no. I think it\u2019s always promotional and our category as we all know is used by certain player as a way to attract traffic. So there sometimes it will be aggressive promotions \u2013 often times limited quantities, but it creates, so no \u2013 we cannot see any chance from that standpoint. Black Friday I think what until the game is played it\u2019s hard to know but we do see a combination of a bit of spreading out but also peaks and valleys being higher and steeper as the consumer has been trained to shop when the prices are more promotional, so I don\u2019t think that there is a material chance here. From a product standpoint, I think what\u2019s exciting this year is that there\u2019s a broad range of exciting categories across what I would characterize as some of our more traditional product categories like for example, TVs and computing the new TVs are just extraordinary and computing our teams have done a great job as well as these emerging categories, so around connected home, around wearable, around drones, around virtual reality, there\u2019s many reasons to come and check our products. Portable audio, there\u2019s also headphones. There\u2019s some really cool new headphones. I\u2019m personally so excited about my personal holiday shopping. I have to disclose I\u2019m going to buy a new drone. I bought one last year but I\u2019m going to buy a new one. This is exciting. Brian Nagel : Well thank you and congrats again. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Hopefully a quick housekeeping item here. Corie, did you guys see an improvement in merchandise margins? And then secondly, can you guys talk about the In-Home Advisor test a little bit more? How far has that been rolled out in your testing? And is there any color that you can potentially provide us regarding kind of take a perspective in terms of the performance there. Thanks. Corie Barry : So from that \u2013 what you refer to as merchandising margins perspective, obviously I think you can tell based on my comments around some of the assortment in the mix and driving in computing and home theatre. Yes, that is part of where we saw some of the improvement. To your question about in-home advisor, I\u2019ll give a little color and if Hubert would like to add any, he\u2019s more than welcome. So obviously we noted that we\u2019re at least rolling out to one more market. It\u2019s still very early and a test like this obviously it takes time not just from an understanding results perspective, but also just from a learning for us expertise training and ensuring we have seamless hand off between our stores and the in-home experience. And so we are really working hard to ensure that we understand all those operational components. We like the experiences we\u2019re learning about in the home. It reinforces I think for us this idea that there\u2019s a lot of technology. It continues to evolve very rapidly, but there is confusion once people have it in their homes in terms of not just how to use it, this isn\u2019t just about broken, it\u2019s also about how do I do the most with it and actually understand how to take it to the next level and then when I\u2019m comfortable doing the most with it, I\u2019m often more likely to investigate and play with more things in my home. So we like the things that we\u2019re learning. You can tell we\u2019re taking a very measured approach to making sure that if we\u2019re going to do this we do it right and we have a lot of confidence in the value prop. That being said at this point, the teams are incredibly focused on delivering holiday and all of the intricacies that go with that. And so we\u2019ll continue to learn and then we\u2019ll obviously update you as we head into next year. Scot Ciccarelli : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from David Magee. Please go ahead. David Magee : Yes, hi, good morning and great quarter. Corie Barry : Thank you. David Magee : Actually a related question to Scot\u2019s, on the Geek Squad with all of the moving parts there lapping the price cuts and these new programs, anything you see there that changes your opinion about the ultimate potential of that business over the next several years? Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you, David. We continue to be excited about the opportunities for a couple of reasons. One is there\u2019s a need of customers for support and again it\u2019s evolving towards maybe less break fix and more support and more help. And two, traditionally, we\u2019ve been focused on selling services at the point of sale as an attach and we see the opportunity to help customers at their point of need. So that\u2019s where Geek Squad on-demand is an opportunity. And if you do the math given our product market share and our percentage of attach, the bulk of the market is something that historically we had not addressed and we\u2019re seeing some exciting green shoots, and experiments. We talked a bit on the call about Canada. We are talking about Magnolia Care. So this is hard work because it\u2019s building a new business in a sense of reinventing an existing business, but we continue to be excited by the opportunity and very focused on doing what it takes creating the right products, service offerings, also the processes to deliver, the capabilities, and then the go to market. So this is going to be, this is going to take time, but we continue to be excited about this. David Magee : Thank you, Hubert. And then just a real quick, on the appliance side, are you seeing your customers embrace connected appliances at this point? Hubert Joly : Yes. This is very early days around that. So it\u2019s good that there\u2019s innovation and people learn from that and so forth. It is not a primary driver of purchase decision for the bulk of the market at this point. David Magee : Thank you. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our last question from Dan Wewer. Please go ahead. Dan Wewer : Thanks. You noted that we have anniversaried the disruption from future shops, restructuring. I wanted to follow-up on that. Where do we stand on rolling out the major appliance departments into the Best Buy stores in Canada? And do you anticipate that once you add a major appliance department, it can grow to 9% of store revenues as it does in the U.S.? Hubert Joly : Okay. So thank you, Dan. So in international, you\u2019ve seen the numbers. There\u2019s quite a bit of momentum there. In Canada specifically, we\u2019ve mentioned in the prepared remarks that the new prototype stores that we\u2019ve developed in partnership with the vendors are performing very promising and so there will be more on that. Appliances is the other opportunity. So when we deploy these new prototype stores, it does include an appliance department and then we also in the process of we\u2019ve begun the process of deploying appliances in the other store. We don\u2019t have a forecast at this point in terms of the percentage of the business. It\u2019s well represented and of course bear in mind that whatever space we allocate to appliance will cannibalize other product categories, but there\u2019s no doubt that this is an opportunity \u2013 a significant opportunity for us, the same view that we have in the U.S. about the opportunity for us exists in Canada. So it\u2019s going to take time to roll this out and we\u2019ll take some investments, but we\u2019re quite excited about it and so more to come on that. Dan Wewer : If I could just follow-up, once you complete these investments in Canada, can the operating margin rate be equivalent to that in the U.S.? Hubert Joly : Again, no specific guidance but conceptually and bear in mind that international is not just about Canada. So don\u2019t directly apply this to your model. But conceptually, certainly is President of Canada is on the phone and listening, Ron Wilson, there\u2019s no reason for Ron not to be able to perform to that same level all the time and it\u2019s going to take time. And I have to congratulate our Canadian team they have done a remarkable job going through that brand consolidation. And then using that as a springboard to move forward, I was with all of their store general managers last month and there is definite momentum here. We have a great team. And so it\u2019s very exciting and we\u2019ll see how quickly they can go through higher levels of margin. So if he\u2019s not on the call, I\u2019ll certainly relay your question to him. Dan Wewer : Okay. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Dan Wewer : Thank you. Hubert Joly : Thank you. In closing, I\u2019d like to do three things. One is, wish every one of you and your family on the call a wonderful holiday season. Number two, I would say that I hope you will give us the opportunity to help you with your holiday shopping this season. And we look forward to serving you either online or in the stores or in your home. And then number three, I\u2019d like to really thank you for your attention and your support throughout the year and hopefully going forward. So thank you. Have a great holiday season. Thank you so much. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s call. You may disconnect at any time and have a wonderful day.",

Thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll begin today with a review of our fourth quarter performance and the progress we made against our fiscal 2017 priorities. I will then provide a preview of what we are focused on for fiscal 2018 before turning the call over to Corie for additional he details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. We\u2019re pleased today to report very solid results for the fourth quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered enterprise revenue of $13.5 billion which is near the midpoint of our guidance range. We improved our non-GAAP operating income rate by 80 basis points to 6.7%, and we delivered higher than expected non-GAAP EPS of $1.95, up 27% compared to $1.53 last year. Our strong bottom line performance was driven by a disciplined promotional strategy, continued optimization of merchandise margins, and strong expense management. Our non-GAAP EPS results also benefited approximately $0.10 year-over-year from a lower tax rate. Domestically, we continued to gain share across the majority of categories and we believe in aggregate this was due to the quality of our you assortment, the strong advertising and promotional cadence and the superior customer experience across channels. From an overall merchandising perspective we saw year-over-year sales growth in connected home, computing, headphones and home theater. This was more than offset by declines in gaming, tablets, health and wearables, and mobile phones. We continue to drive significant growth in the online channel, with e-commerce revenue increasing 17.5%. E-commerce revenue was 18.6% of total domestic revenue, compared to 15.6% in the fourth quarter of last year. From the a top line perspective, our revenue was hindered by constrained product availability across multiple vendors and categories, only some of which was anticipated. While we\u2019ve experienced constrained product availability before, the situation felt unprecedented, given how widespread these issues were. As you may have noticed, there have been public reports regarding several of our vendors on this topic. These issues impacted multiple categories including phones, tablets, wearables, computing, and drones, and were on top of the of previously communicated $200 million of top line pressure related to the Samsung product recalls. Also, significantly impacting our top line results was the softness in the gaming category. We expected some decline in gaming sales heading into the quarter, but the level of industry softness across both gaming hardware and software was much steeper than anticipated. As a note, the fourth quarter is a much more material quarter for the gaming category, as 50% of the annual revenue from gaming occurs in the fourth quarter. In the international business, our teams drove a significant improvement in profitability, increasing operating income rate 240 basis points to 7.1%. On a full year basis, we delivered the top line performance we outlined at the beginning of the year, with materially better earnings growth than originally expected. For the year on revenue of $13.4 billion, we increased our non-GAAP operating income rate from 4% to 4.5%, and grew non-GAAP EPS by 28% from $2.78 to $3.56. Our free cash flow for the year was $2 billion, compared to $633 million last year, and we ended the year with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. We returned $1.2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and today we announced plans to increase our cash return to shareholders over the next two years. During fiscal 2017, we executed against the three priorities we shared at the beginning of the year, which were to build on our strong industry position in multi-channel capabilities to drive the existing be business, to drive cost reduction and efficiencies, and to advance key initiatives to drive future growth and differentiation. The successful execution against these priorities drove our positive results. Let me take a minute to provide some highlights. One, we continued to gain share in home theater, appliances, computing, and nearly all of the major C categories. And we believe the total market for our product categories was down low single digits in calendar 2016, so clearly, our market share gains helped us offset the market decline. We increased our Net Promoter Score by over 350 basis points. We grew domestic online revenue 21%. The successful Canadian transformation was the primary driver of more than $100 million in international operating income, compared to a loss of $4 million last year. Including an additional $50 million in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve now achieved $350 million of our three-year target to reduce cost and optimize gross profit by $400 million, enabling us to invest in customer experience improvements, while maintaining near flat SG&A. As for the third priority, fiscal 2017 was a year of exploration and experimentation. We\u2019re continuing to test several concepts around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences, and we will be rolling out a number of them in fiscal 2018, something I\u2019ll talk about in a minute. So overall, another year of significant progress. I\u2019m very proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished, and I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work, their dedication, and customer focus. As you may recall, in November 2012 we introduced our transformation strategy called Renew Blue. Since then, we\u2019ve stabilized comparable sales, increased our non-GAAP operating income rate 110 basis points from 3.4% to 4.5%, and grew our non-GAAP EPS from $2.54 to $3.56, at an average rate of 9% per year. We also increased our return on invested capital or ROIC 110 basis points from 10.8% to 18.9%. A little more than four years later, we figured it is time to call Renew Blue officially over and enter the next phase of our journey. Today we are unveiling Best Buy 2020, building the new blue. In this next phase, we go from turning around the Company to shaping our future, and creating a Company that customers and employees love, and that continues to generate a superior return for our shareholders. At the core of Best Buy 2020 is of course the customer. Technology is evolving and is more and more exciting, with new capabilities that are opening up an increasing range of possibilities. It\u2019s also more complex, and many of us need help with it. So we believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned to help our customers in a meaningful way with our combination of unique assets, including our online, store, and in-home capabilities. As we look ahead, our purpose is to help customers pursue their passions and enrich their lives, with the help of technology. We want to play two roles for them. Be their trusted advisor and solution provider, and be their source for technology services for their home. Our customer value proposition is to be the leading technology expert, who makes is easy for them to learn about and confidently enjoy the best technology. We believe we can and should go beyond selling products to customers. We want to focus on their underlying needs which is entertainment, communications, security, energy management, and health. We believe this approach will better meet their needs, and build a stronger relationship with them. This will also allow us to expand our addressable market. From a financial standpoint, the equation that we\u2019re seeking to solve with Best Buy 2020 is to gradually increase our rate of top line growth, pursue material ongoing cost savings necessary to both offset inflationary pressures and fund investments, and build a more predictable set of revenue streams, built on more recurring revenues and stickier customer relationships. More specifically, with Best Buy 2020, there are three growth pillars we will be pursuing : One is to maximize the multi-channel retail business. Two is to provide services and solutions that solve real customer needs, and help us build deeper customer relationships. And three is to accelerate growth in Canada and Mexico. With the first pillar, maximize the multi-channel retail business, we plan to continue to enhance the customer experience and drive revenue by growing both existing and new channels, growing certain key product categories, and developing broader, stickier customer relationships. With the second pillar, provide services and solutions that solve real customer needs, we plan to meet the significant technical support needs of customers across their home, whether or not they have bought their products at Best Buy. We also plan to offer more complete solutions to our customers that meet their underlying needs. As an example, instead of just selling them security cameras, this would mean selling an ongoing security monitoring and home automation service. With our third pillar, after significant transformation efforts, we believe Canada and Mexico have the opportunity to accelerate their growth. All together, we\u2019re quite excited about the range of opportunities we have in each of these areas. We also know we have work to do to capture them and create a meaningful impact on our results. As with Renew Blue, we will regularly update you on our progress on our journey to build the new blue. In this context, we see fiscal 2018 as a step in the direction of building the new blue. Completely, we\u2019ll be executing against the following four priorities : First, we will explore and pursue growth opportunities around the pillars I just discussed. Most notably, we will continue to innovate our digital capability to effectively help our customers in their shopping journey. We will pursue growth around key product categories, including emerging product categories like connected home, appliances where we believe we can continue to grow share and revenue, and mobile, where we have the opportunity to return to growth by providing a more compelling experience to our customers. We plan to expand our In-Home Advisor program, or IHA to more markets. With our IHA program, customers receive a free in-home consultation with our experienced technology advisor, who can identify their needs, design personalized solutions, and become a personal resource over time. We will continue to test new concepts around the country that have the potential to be compelling customer experiences. We have a pipeline of opportunities, some of which we will expect to ramp up later in the year. And we\u2019ll drive growth in the international business by continuing to drive our e-commerce channel, and by expanding the rollout of the successful store remodels in Canada, and opening nine new stores in Mexico over the next two years. The second priority is to improve our execution in key areas. We believe we continue to have significant opportunities from improving our sales effectiveness and proficiency, improving our supply chain for large product fulfillment and small package delivery and developing our services fulfillment capabilities. The third priority is to continue to reduce costs and drive efficiency throughout the business. As I mentioned before, we\u2019ve achieved $350 million of our current $400 million cost reduction target. We\u2019re working on the next phase of cost savings and we will update you on the next goal once we complete our current program. The fourth priority is to build the capabilities necessary to deliver on the first three, which will involve making investments in people and systems to drive growth, execution and efficiencies. Now, before I turn the call over to Corie, I\u2019d like to provide some thoughts about our financial outlook and updated return of capital plan for fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018, which is a 53-week year, we\u2019re expecting enterprise revenue growth of approximately 1.5%, and an operating income growth rate in the low single digits. On a 52-week basis, we\u2019re expecting approximately flat revenue and operating income. Our annual outlook is influenced by a number of factors including expected share gains and the positive impact from our new initiatives, offset by our assumption that the industry growth will remain negative, and product availability issues will continue, particularly in the first half of the year. We are also expecting our investments and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $60 million of lower profit share revenue, to be offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives, and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies. While we\u2019re expecting flat top and bottom line results for the full year, of course, our quarterly performance can fluctuate, based on product cycles, inventory availability issues, and industry dynamics. In our Q1 fiscal 2018 guidance reflects the softness we\u2019ve seen and reported so far this quarter in the NPD tracked categories, and continued softness in the mobile phone category, due both to last year\u2019s product recall and the assumption that new product launches will occur later in the quarter than they did last year. Corie will provide more detail about our Q1 guidance. Let me now say a few words about our return of cash to our shareholders. We have a strong cash position today, and continue to drive significant cash flow generation. We remain committed to our previously articulated capital allocation strategy, which is to first fund operations and growth investments, including potential partnerships and acquisitions, and then to return the remaining excess free cash flow to our shareholders over time with dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining investment grade credit metrics. We continue to believe it is important to reward our shareholders by being a premium dividend payer, and increasing our earnings per share through ongoing share repurchases. As such, we announced this morning that our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share or $1.36 per year. The Board also approved our plan to spend $3 billion on share repurchases over the next two years. Last year we announced a plan to spend $1 billion over two years and we spent $750 million in the first year. So with this new plan, we intend to accelerate our repurchases over the next two years. So in summary, we\u2019re very proud of the results we delivered in fiscal 2017, and we are excited about our opportunities and the strategy we\u2019re pursuing. I want to again thank all of our associates for what they do every day, and for their passion to build the new blue. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry. Corie Barry : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. As Hubert mentioned earlier, our disciplined promotional strategy was key to delivering better than expected profitability, despite enterprise revenue near the midpoint of our fourth-quarter guidance. On enterprise revenue of $13.5 billion, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.95, which exceeded our expectations, primarily due to a lower than expected effective income tax rate, and outperformance in the domestic business from both a higher gross profit rate and lower than expected SG&A. I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue decreased 1% to $13.5 billion, primarily due to an enterprise comparable sales decline of 0.7%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.42 or 27% to $1.95. This increase was primarily driven by, one, a $0.14 per share benefit from the net share count change. Two, the domestic business, primarily due to a higher gross profit rate and lower SG&A including the expected $38 million or $0.06 per share of net negative impact from the lapping of the periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. And three, a $0.10 per share benefit from a lower effective income tax rate, due to the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. In our domestic segment, revenue decreased 1.4% to $12.3 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 0.9%, and the loss of revenue from 11 large format and 31 Best Buy mobile stores closed during the past year. Industry sales in the NPD tracked categories, which don\u2019t include categories such as mobile phones and appliances, declined 2.8%. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in connected homes, computing, headphones and home theater was more than offset by declines in gaming, tablets, health and wearables, and mobile phones. In services, the comparable revenue growth of 6.3% was primarily driven by higher warranty sales, as we have now lapped the investments in services pricing from last September. Domestic online revenue of $2.3 billion increased 17.5% on a comparable basis, primarily due to increased traffic and higher conversion rates. As a percentage of total domestic revenue, online revenue increased 300 basis points to 18.6%, versus 15.6% last year. In our international segment, revenue increased 2.5% to $1.14 billion, driven by comparable sales growth of 0.9%, primarily from our business in Mexico, and approximately 90 basis point periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio, which is excluded from comparable sales, and approximately 70 basis points of positive foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 22.5%. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 22.3%, primarily due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theater categories, and the positive impact of decreased sales in the lower margin categories of gaming and wearables. These rate increases were partially offset by margin pressure in the mobile category and approximately $30 million or 20 basis points of net negative impact due to lapping the periodic profit sharing benefit. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 280 basis points to 24.6%, driven by a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to improved margin rates in the computing and home theater categories, and approximately $10 million or 65 basis point periodic profit sharing benefit, and the positive impact of decreased sales in the lower margin gaming category. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise level non-GAAP SG&A was $2.1 billion or 15.8% of revenue, a decrease of $10 million. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.93 billion or 15.6% of revenue, a decrease of $18 million. This decrease was primarily driven by lower variable costs, as a result of decreased year-over-year revenue. Additionally Renew Blue phase two cost reductions continued to offset investments in the business. International non-GAAP SG&A was $200 million or 17.5% of revenue, an increase of $8 million. This increase was primarily driven by slightly higher payroll and benefits and advertising costs. From a cash flow perspective, fiscal 2017 was another year of strong cash flow generation, driven primarily by working capital changes and increased profitability. The decrease in working capital was primarily due to a higher accounts payable to inventory ratio, which was the result of, one, timing from last year when we brought in inventory early and subsequently paid for it before year-end, thereby reducing our accounts payable to inventory ratio in fiscal 2016. And two, the lack of product availability in certain key categories during Q4 fiscal 2017. On a two year basis, our working capital was relatively in line with our historic cash flow impact. The continued strong cash flow generation allowed us to return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders for the second year in a row. This year, we returned over $1.2 billion in cash in addition to the $1.5 billion we returned in fiscal 2016. As it relates to capital expenditures, we ended fiscal 2017 with $582 million in capital spend, and we expect fiscal 2018 capital expenditures to be approximately $650 million. I would now like to talk about our Q1 fiscal 2018 guidance. As Hubert mentioned, in the domestic business, we are seeing softness in the NPD tracked categories, due in part we believe to the delay in tax refunds that resulted in many consumers not having their refunds in time for the Presidents\u2019 Day retail holiday. Additionally, we expect pressure in the mobile category, which is not included in the NPD tracked categories we referenced due to, one, the continued impact of the Samsung Note 7 recall, which is estimated at $50 million in lower revenue year-over-year. And two, the assumption that potential new phone launches will occur later in the quarter than they did last year. With these items factored in, we expect enterprise revenue in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.3 billion, and an enterprise comparable sales decline in the range of negative 1% to negative 2%. On a segment basis, we are estimating domestic comparable sales to decline in the range of negative 1.5% to negative 2.5%, and international comparable sales in the range of flat to positive 3%. It is important to note that due to expected foreign currency headwinds, we anticipate international revenue growth to decline low-single digits. We expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.35 to $0.40. Assuming a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 38% to 38.5%, and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 313 million shares. This guidance range includes lapping approximately $15 million or $0.03 per share of net negative impact from the periodic profit sharing benefit from our Canadian service plan portfolio that was recorded in Q1 fiscal 2017. As Hubert mentioned earlier, when talking about our full year expectations, we will have a 53rd week in fiscal 2018, which will occur in the fourth quarter. We expect that extra week to add approximately 1.5% of annual sales at an operating income rate that is materially higher than the fourth quarter. This operating income rate differential is driven by the added leverage of our fixed costs, which are not impacted by the extra week. We expect to provide more detailed expectations of the 53rd week impact when we provide Q4 fiscal 2018 guidance later in the year. I would also add that we are expecting the fiscal 2018 full year non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 36.5%, compared to 33.2% in fiscal 2017. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kate McShane. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kate McShane : Hi thank you, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Hubert Joly : Good morning, Kate. Kate McShane : Good morning. Hubert, I was wondering if you could maybe walk us through the promotional environment in the fourth quarter, and how you managed through it. I think that was a highlight during \u2013 in the press release today, that it was better managed. So if you could give a little bit more perspective on that versus last year that would be helpful. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Kate. I think we\u2019ve developed that capability. This is not the first year we\u2019re doing this. I think it\u2019s been a theme for us, I would say over the last three years. I have to recommend our merchant and marketing team for this. There\u2019s a greater science that\u2019s being applied to our marketing and promotional activities that is resulting in this outcome. We\u2019re trying to combine being very price competitive, and as we had said three years ago, not chasing every rat into every rat hole. From time to time a competitor will have a very aggressive promotion with very limited quantities available or not necessarily the products that our customers actually want, and we\u2019ll be thoughtful in terms of what we want to do from that standpoint. So that\u2019s at the highest level, that\u2019s what I would describe. The other driver of course has been the optimization of our merchandising activities, and the resulting impact on gross profit margin. As you\u2019ve noticed, our customers like the more advanced, tend to prefer the higher-end premium products oftentimes, and we\u2019ve been able in multiple product categories to really developed a superior merchandising and customer experience both online and in our stores around this. That will be true in TVs. That will be true in computing, for example. And we are also benefiting from that. Corie, anything I missed? Corie Barry : No, I think you hit most of it. Hubert Joly : Thanks. Kate McShane : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Binder. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Dan Binder : Thank you. Hubert, I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit more about the opportunity on in-home advisory services and products, what you saw in the tests, and in terms of average spend, and the type of customers you\u2019re targeting, and the scalability of that? Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you, Dan. I think we\u2019re very excited about the customer experience from this program. As a reminder for everyone, this is an expert technology advisor, who has got great both product proficiency across everything we sell, and great customer relationship skills, will typically go to the customer\u2019s house. Why is it important to go to the customer\u2019s house? In many cases, if we want to have a discussion about your networking needs, or your home theater, or how you want to automate your home, we really need to have this conversation in your home. And from a customer standpoint, this is not limited to luxury and premium. We\u2019ve had this motto that Corie introduced when she was leading this program of no order too small, no sale is too small. We see this as the beginning of a beautiful friendship, as we would say in Casablanca, or the beginning of a customer relationship, as the In-Home Advisor can become an ongoing resource for the customer. The results are very encouraging, Dan. The customer satisfaction from this is very material. Our stores \u2013 the front liners are a good test of whether something makes sense or not. And the level of excitement in the field, I think, it\u2019s very high. Financially, this is resulting in positive results, there is a higher sale average, sale per visit, tend to be also a better gross profit margin, because it\u2019s going to be a more complete solution. And then of course, what we expect is the tail, that again this is going to be a strong ongoing relationship, a higher share of the basket. Now, this is something that from a scaling standpoint, we\u2019re not rushing, because we want to make sure we get this right, and we scale this right. This is \u2013 it\u2019s easy to talk about, but finding the right personnel, training them appropriately, managing them effectively, giving them the right tools, CRM tools, for example, the ability also to build a customer in their home. So we\u2019re pacing ourselves. We do believe this is going to scale. In fact, in my prepared remarks, I commented on the fact that we would go to more markets. But, because this is almost a professional services business, you don\u2019t want to go overnight to full scale. So we\u2019ll pace our self, and we\u2019ll update you as we move forward. So, all together, very, very exciting. It\u2019s a good illustration, if you will, Dan, of where the Company is going. We go beyond just selling products and solving real customer needs, touching people\u2019s lives. There\u2019s so many great stories about how our In-Home Advisors have really touched people in their lives, changing how they live. It\u2019s not just about using technology, it\u2019s about touching their lives. I\u2019m becoming emotional, so I\u2019ll stop. Dan Binder : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Brad Thomas. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brad Thomas : Yes, thank you, good morning. I wanted to ask about the consumer electronics category. Really a nice performance in that category in the quarter, and hoping you could talk about some of the potential catalysts for that category in 2017, particularly the performance of the home theater area? Corie Barry : Yes, so good morning, Brad. This is Corie. There\u2019s a few things going on there. I\u2019m going to start with home theater. Home theater continues to perform well, but it is not the biggest driver of this quarter of some of the increase we\u2019re seeing, other things that are included in the consumer electronics category are our connected home products. We\u2019ve seen some very nice growth out of our home automation products, in particular. And we also actually have our headphone category in consumer electronics, which has been a strong performer for us over the last quarter. And then finally, we actually saw a bit of a tick- up in our digital imaging business, as well that contributed. So really, in home theater we continued to see good results. Sequentially that\u2019s been pretty consistent. It was some of those other categories that really outperformed in Q4. Brad Thomas : Got you. And how are you thinking about home theater in particular in 2017? Thank you. Corie Barry : Yes, so obviously, I\u2019m not going to give category guidance, but in general what I\u2019d say as we \u2013 we expect into the same dynamic to play out, which is, we\u2019ve seen good unit growth over time as new technologies become more and more accessible. But that has obviously come at lower ASPs, and what we like for us is that the balance between those two things, and the mix of business for us, that\u2019s what Hubert commented on, this ability for us to sell the more fully featured, the up and coming technology, to really experience what a 60, 70, 90-inch TV\u2019s looks and feels like, that mix of business for us has been very helpful and very strong. Now, obviously we\u2019d expect continued proliferation of technologies, always means a moderation in the ASP gains and we\u2019ve said we\u2019d expect some of the share gains to moderate, but we don\u2019t expect this to look like a cliff for us. We expect continued evolution and development in the category, and we think we\u2019re really well positioned to continue to see this category through the next year. Brad Thomas : Very helpful. Thank you, Corie. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Michael Lasser. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. It dovetails on the whole market share conversation. Can you describe why this spread between your sales and the NPD results narrowed this quarter? And as part of that, where is your absolute level of market share today across all categories, and is it just harder to grow share at that level, absent more store closings from competitors? Corie Barry : I will try these one at a time. First, on the spread question, in the actual categories that are included in NPD, our spread was actually very similar in Q4 as it has been in Q2, Q3, and if anything, it actually might have grown a little bit. The tricky part is the categories that are not included in NPD, and a couple of those we specifically called out multiple times in the release and that is mobile and gaming. In those categories, we said we saw pressure, due to a couple different factors. But it\u2019s those categories that are creating a little bit of the shrink in the differential between our results, and what you see in NPD. In terms of the overall share of the markets, we haven\u2019t ever publicly released what we think the overall market share looks like. We did talk a little bit in the release about the fact we just generally believe that the overall market has been down, certainly down in the last calendar year, and that we\u2019ve been able to gain share, and we continue as we said, going forward, we continue to believe we\u2019re well positioned to do that. Hubert Joly : Maybe if can add a couple of sentences to what Corie said. I think back in the Renew Blue presentation in November 2012, we actually had some aggregate market share numbers, and Michael, if you go back, they were in the mid-teens. That\u2019s if you go across all of the categories. And so one of the things we\u2019re very clear internally is that as long as we\u2019re not at 100% market share, we have opportunity to grow. This is still a very fragmented market. Of course, our share varies across product categories. We think that the needs of customers in our categories are very sophisticated. We\u2019re raising the bar. There\u2019s probably a couple of competitors who are also raising the bar, but it\u2019s hard for people to compete in this category at the same pace and level of investments we\u2019re making. So we think there is a lot of runway in terms of gaining market share. Now, as we introduce Best Buy 2020, building the New Blue, our strategy is not just to gain market share in these product categories. It\u2019s to go beyond that and address underlying customer needs in terms of services and solutions, which significantly expands our addressable market. While there\u2019s a lot of work we have to do to capture these opportunities, that\u2019s another axis, if you will of our growth potential. Michael Lasser : Thanks so much. Hubert Joly : Thank you Michael. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the Matt Fassler. Please go ahead. Matt Fassler : Thanks so much and good morning. My question revolves around the mobile category. It\u2019s been challenging now, I guess, for a year or more. And I understand there\u2019s some idiosyncratic challenges with products and recalls, et cetera. Can this return to being a growth category for you, as you think about market growth, your market share, and the profitability of the category? Hubert Joly : Yes, so there\u2019s several factors. One is the market, the other one is market share. Clearly after many years of increasing penetration of smartphones in this country, the penetration is now at a very high level, and you\u2019re more in a replacement market, specifically during the quarter. In addition, the market which we think from a handset standpoint in calendar Q4 was down, the market was hindered by the product recall issue, and then by demand supply issues that the other vendor had in this category and that was reported on their call. So we don\u2019t expect significant growth in this category from a market standpoint. What we briefly commented upon in my prepared remarks, is that we believe that we have the opportunity, and that\u2019s going to be our goal, to gain market share. As you know, this is one of the categories where our share is the lowest, in single digits. We continue to believe that buying a phone today at any retailer is not a pleasant experience. It\u2019s actually quite painful, and our ambition is to provide a smoother, easier, more compelling customer experience, and on that basis, leveraging the rest of our assets including the very large traffic we have both online and in our stores to do this. So we\u2019re working on that, and so we have the ambition to grow a little bit our market share. It\u2019s much more that, than expecting the market to grow. Matt Fassler : If I could just ask a brief follow-up. If you think about the various pricing models and the way they have evolved over the past year or two, and I know that remains dynamic, does that impact the margin structure of the category for you, or can the margins be as good as they are, say, today? Corie Barry : Hey Matt, its Corie, I think it\u2019s reasonable to say that we\u2019d expect there to be a bit of margin pressure in the category. It\u2019s not just the changes, it\u2019s broader than just the changes in how people are paying. It\u2019s also, as you think about the unlocked and prepaid businesses being much more viable models as well for customers, which again we think is great space for us to play in because it offers choice and gives us a different way to position ourselves in the category. You\u2019ve seen it for the last few quarters at least, listed as one of the margin pressures for us, and I think that continues. Matt Fassler : Got it thank you so much guys. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Matt. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from is from Simeon Gutman. You line is open please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the operating profit outlook. So it\u2019s mentioned in the release, you have the $60 million headwind from profit share, and then there\u2019s just natural cost creep. I played with some numbers. You can get anywhere $50 million, $60 million, maybe $100 million. Then you\u2019re investing in businesses. I don\u2019t know if the size is as important, but this idea that you\u2019re still able to reduce meaningful expenses, which is where the guidance implies, can you talk about where it\u2019s coming from, especially as you continue to make investments? Incrementally, is it getting to find? But it looks like there\u2019s some sizable numbers embedded in the Fiscal 2018 guide. Corie Barry : Yes, there is a couple of things going on with the guide. Number one, let\u2019s take the cost side first. Obviously, we\u2019re very pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made thus far on the Renew Blue phase two cost reductions. $150 million in FY16, $200 million in FY17, and we feel like we\u2019re well positioned to close that out this year, and then talk more openly about what comes next. In those buckets, the places where we\u2019ve seen some really nice progress. If you remember back to when Sharon would talk a lot about some of the returns, replacements and damaged inventory, the teams have done some really exceptional work in those areas and across the board have created profitability. Remember, sometimes these show up in gross profit. Sometimes they show up in SG&A. Some of this is the work that actually ends showing up in gross profits. And is improving some of that return and damaged inventory. Another place where we have seen some good improvements is across supply chain and across contractually how we think about some of our agreements with our carriers and the way we\u2019re making some of our supply chain choices. We think some nice cost reductions there as well. I think we\u2019ve said it from the beginning, that this phase, it is more cross functional. It is very different than the first $1 billion we took out. It requires us to think differently about our processes. To your question about, is there really going to be more, isn\u2019t it just going to get harder? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy, but I think we all fundamentally believe that. Just like you would expect in manufacturing. We have to continue to find productivity in our business, and better and more efficient ways of doing things. Frankly, at the end of the day, they typically also result in a better employee and a better customer experience. The truth is if we have costs that we\u2019re embedding, somewhere down the line, it\u2019s breaking. The second piece, Simeon, I want to make sure that I call out, and we said it in the release, is that we also are expecting to roll out some of these new initiatives, and we\u2019re expecting some return on those initiatives, as well. It\u2019s not just the cost reduction side. It\u2019s also an expectation that we see returns on these initiatives that to be clear, we\u2019re vetting very carefully, based on the tests and pilots that we\u2019re running thus far. Does that help. Simeon Gutman : Yes. Thanks very much, good luck. Hubert Joly : I want to amplify what Corie said. I don\u2019t want there to be any doubt. Not that there was any ambiguity in what Corie said, but in terms of the cost take-out and we said it on previous calls, this is for us an ongoing focus and discipline, and while we\u2019ve not communicated today the goal for the next phase because our tradition is to first complete the phase. And then we announce the next phase, we believe there is going to be ongoing continued material opportunity for improving performance, our effectiveness, efficiency across our key processes. Lean is a term that\u2019s been used throughout the Company, and there is ample opportunity. So while we\u2019ve announced today a new strategy, Best Buy 2020, building the New Blue that has a strong growth orientation, customer orientation, equally important is this focus on cost, which is critical to offset the pressures. We don\u2019t have cost creep, we have some precious and have some pressures and then we have investments to fund. So this continues to be a balancing act, but I don\u2019t want any doubts about the sense we have about the opportunity, and our commitment to ongoing cost optimization. Am I clear? Simeon Gutman : Yes. Thanks, Hubert. Very clear. Operator : Our next question is from Alan Rifkin. Your line is open please go ahead. Alan Rifkin : Thank you very much. My question has to do with the product availability. At the beginning of the quarter, you had said that there would be about 150 basis point impact to your guidance for the fourth-quarter comp due to Samsung alone. Obviously the product availability in the quarter spread beyond Samsung. I was wondering either with respect to dollars or comp, what was the impact of difficulty in procuring some of the product, and what gives you the confidence that these difficulties will be alleviated at the beginning of the second half? Thank you. Hubert Joly : Alan. Thank you for the questions. Calculating the missed opportunity is not an exact science. We have tried to quantify what we believe is the impact in the quarter from these really unprecedented constrained product availability issues. We believe it was well over $100 million of missed sales in the quarter, and frankly could be close or around $200 million, and that\u2019s on top of the $200 million impact from the Samsung recalls. And this was across multiple vendors, I won\u2019t go through all of the details but many vendors have spoken about this supply demand, imbalances on their calls or the press has reported, and you may have experienced yourself in our stores or online because I know all of you are frequent shoppers. That\u2019s about the order of magnitude, Alan . In terms of next year or this fiscal year, in our prepared remarks, both Corie and I have spoken about the impact in the first half, notably from the product recall from last year, meaning the Note 7 not being available for sale. This year that\u2019s about $50 million. And then at least there\u2019s an assumption on our part based on various public indications that the launch of a new phone would happen later in the quarter, even though we don\u2019t have a firm date at this point in time. So some of these things erode in the second half. So clearly a bit like last year, in aggregate, we\u2019re seeing a softer beginning of the year, and then a recovery in the second half. We have to be humble in terms of forecasting, because frankly, these product availability issues could not have been anticipated at the beginning of the last year, and so we are sharing with you some assumptions. But it\u2019s hard to be certain of course, at this point in time. Alan Rifkin : Thank you, Hubert. Hubert Joly : Thank you Alan Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Chukumba. Your line is open please go ahead. Anthony Chukumba : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I guess I had two questions. The first one was just in terms of the domestic gross margin. Obviously, the performance was very strong. Looks like you continue to do a very nice job of having very effective promotions. But I wonder, do you worry that you might have left some sales on the table, maybe some gross margin dollars on the table, by maybe not being a little bit more aggressive promotionally? How do you think about that? Hubert Joly : So this is something we constantly look at, particularly during this holiday quarter, which is very and so forth. If we could have generated more sales, more profitable sales through more promotional activity, we would have done it. I think the cap on our revenue is really the two things we highlighted. One was the product availability issues. No point in promoting a product that\u2019s not available, obviously. And then the very material softness in gaming. So the short answer to your question, Anthony, is no, we don\u2019t feel \u2013 this is not completely scientific. We don\u2019t feel we left money on the table from a top line standpoint based on promotional decisions. Anthony Chukumba : Okay, great. And then just real quickly\u2026 Hubert Joly : I want to reiterate, profitable top line. You can always lose money, but that\u2019s not what you want us to do. Anthony Chukumba : Understood. Agreed. Agreed. And then just real quickly. One of your competitors, a multi-regional appliance and consumer electronics retailer, seems like they\u2019re in a pretty bad spot right now. They may be filing for bankruptcy. How do you sort of think about the market share gain opportunity, if and when that happens, and to the extent that leads to significant store closings? Hubert Joly : So thank you for this question. So we\u2019re not going to mention the name of this particular retailer, but I think that if we\u2019re thinking about the same, they have about 200 stores roughly, so it\u2019s about 20% of our stores have an overlap with them. I think they do about $1 billion of revenue in appliances, and the rest of their business is mainly furniture, don\u2019t have much electronics left. If they do file and close their stores, which we have no information about, then you can assume that the $1 billion would be shared across a variety of players. These are the orders of magnitude, so not something transformative for us. There\u2019s been a pattern in this category of some players consistent generous share donors, and we do expect that to continue in the quarter, which is one of the reasons we\u2019re excited about the appliance category. Anthony Chukumba : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning and Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to ask, just on e-commerce. We\u2019ve seen a very strong performance out of your e-commerce sales now for the past several quarters, it\u2019s pushing up towards almost 20% of your business. Two parts. One, any thoughts on where that ultimately drives to as a share of total sales? And second, as e-commerce now is a much more significant part of your business, any thoughts on or how should we think about the profitability of those sales versus more traditional sales in your stores? Thanks. Hubert Joly : Thank you, Brian. So let me take the first part, and then Corie will lead the second part on the economic impact. So number one, very proud of the performance of our e-commerce channel. I think if you go back four years ago, the experience on our site and the experience on our site today and mobile app, this is a sea change, complete transformation, both on the shopping experience, as well as the supply chain, so very, very proud of that. From the beginning, we said that we wanted to be driven by how customers want to buy, and shop and buy. And so, in the way we run the business, we\u2019re not trying to steer the customer towards one channel or the other. And in fact, it\u2019s increasingly difficult to identify what channel is responsible for the business, because the customers will usually start online, maybe complete the sale online, may go to the store and back and forth, and of course 40% of the orders are picked up in the store or shipped from the store. So there\u2019s a blurring of the two channels. There is clearly a trend, though, in particular for the smaller, simpler items, for customers to buy online, something that you\u2019re familiar with. It\u2019s hard to know how high it\u2019s going to be. What we also know is that for the larger cube, higher touch categories where seeing the product, having access to an experienced sales associate, and then having the in-home experience, that set of assets is really critical for us. So we\u2019re driven by innovating the customer experience, developing competitive experience, combining our two sets of assets. In general, that means we believe the online piece will continue to expand, and we do believe that our stores have a critical role to play. Now, from an economic standpoint, Corie, tells us how we see it. Corie Barry : From a channel shift perspective, while it\u2019s true that in general, we tend to see lower profitability in gross profit online, and a lot of that due to obviously some of the attach, the things that you do in the store in a relationship, that are a little bit harder to do online. The team has done an exceptional job of improving the profitability of our online business year-over-year. And so while you have the mix impact, that puts a little bit of pressure, you have a rate improvement in the channel in and of itself which has really been helping us mitigate that channel shift. Additionally, one of the things that\u2019s a little bit different for us is that we obviously invest in our in-store expertise, and we spend time with our customers, and we invest in that expertise which means obviously when you\u2019re in store, there is an expense profile associated with being in store. And that helps create a balance with actually the expense profile that we have, and usually associated with shipping and some of the other supply chain metrics online. And so we don\u2019t find the disparity between the channels to be as great as some people would talk about, but at the same time, we\u2019re very clear about our belief that this continues, and it continues because of how people like to shop, and it\u2019s also a big part of the reason that Hubert talked about. We believe strongly that cost control continues to be something that\u2019s really important for us, as we think about our business going forward. Brian Nagel : Great. Thank you very helpful. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our last question from Scot Ciccarelli. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mike Lehrhoff : Hi, this is Mike Lehrhoff on for Scot Ciccarelli. I was wondering if you could discuss your expectations for the gaming category in the coming year, as well as any guidance on future store closures this year? Corie Barry : All right. We\u2019ll start with gaming. Obviously we\u2019ve seen, like we said, softness coming out of Q4. Gaming is very interesting for us. We tend to over-index on the hardware side of gaming. And so we tend to be very tied to major releases and the demand around the excitement on those releases, and so it\u2019s a little bit difficult for us to understand exactly what some of those product launches will look like. In general, we don\u2019t expect a massive change in the trajectory, other than the extent to which those releases are exciting for people. So obviously, as we go into Q1 here, we have the switch as part of the guidance that we gave you for Q1 and the excitement around that. From there on out, we don\u2019t have a ton of visibility to how the market will change over time, but we\u2019ll continue to update you as we know more about the product cycle on that one. But in general, I think that\u2019s the hardware side. On the software side, we definitely continue to see a move towards digital and that obviously, from the way that we sell, puts some pressure on our sales, because we tend to be more of a physical gaming retailer versus a digital one. I think I would expect that shift to continue and that pressure to continue to be there, as we go forward. Your second question on store closures, and so, we obviously have a very stringent process here for looking at our stores. Within the next, oh, call it five years, we\u2019re going to see about 70% of our leases \u2013 we see about 100 a year. That gives us some flexibility. As we look at those leases, as you would expect, we do have a pretty high bar that we set for our stores. We talked earlier about our expectation that online growth continues at the pace we\u2019ve seen it. We build those expectations into the expectations for our store performance. And we assume that there\u2019s a definite chunk of that, that cannibalizes those stores. And so as we think about the store performance, we\u2019re setting a high bar, based on what the store actually needs to perform, assuming that online growth. Given that, you can see over the last two years we\u2019ve closed about 24 stores, and so I would expect us to continue to see that store closure effort going forward, and that will continue to use those high expectations for growth in the online channel. Hubert Joly : Thank you Corie. Maybe in closing, let me just say a couple of things. As we close fiscal 2017, clearly we\u2019re very proud of the results we\u2019ve delivered in this last year, and as we begin fiscal 2018, we\u2019re very excited about the next phase of our journey that we\u2019ve announced today, Best Buy 2020. We\u2019re also excited about the return of capital plans that we\u2019ve announced this morning. Thank you very much for your attention this morning and your continued support. Have a great day. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Hubert Joly : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll begin today with a review of our first quarter performance and the progress we made against our fiscal 2018 priorities. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. We are pleased today to report strong top and bottom line growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We grew our Enterprise comparable sales by 1.6%, improved our non-GAAP operating income rate by 70 basis points to 3.5% and delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.60, up 40% compared to $0.43 last year. Clearly, our revenue was higher than our expectations going into the quarter. This was due to strong performance in gaming, a better than expected result in mobile and the improvement of our overall sales trends within the quarter due to the arrival of delayed federal tax refund checks. Let me briefly elaborate on these three points. First, we delivered a strong performance in gaming due to robust customer demand and good product allocations for the new hardware that launched during the quarter. Second, as expected, while mobile was not a growth area due to last year\u2019s product recall and the fact that new phones launched later in the quarter than they did last year, sales in the quarter were better than we expected as new unlimited data plan offers from the carriers generated increased demand across devices. Additionally, our strong multichannel execution of the preorder process for the new phone that launched in April resulted in our highest Android preorder sales ever coupled with strong services sales. Lastly, in the Domestic business, we saw overall sales trend improve from the initial softness at the beginning of the quarter as consumers began receiving their delayed federal tax refund checks. Let me now talk about our year-over-year performance, starting with our Domestic business. We grew our Domestic comparable sales by 1.4% during the quarter, driven by strengths in computing, Connected Home and gaming, partially offset by continued softness in tablets. We also continued to drive significant growth in the online channel, with Domestic online comparable sales increasing 22.5%, driven by conversion and traffic. Online revenue was nearly 13% of total Domestic revenue compared to 10.6% in the first quarter of last year. In the International business, we delivered a 4% comparable sales increase, driven by continued growth of online revenue in Canada and Mexico and positive sales lifts associated with the Canadian store redesigns. On the profitability side, at the Enterprise level, continued optimization of merchandise margins and good expense management drove the 70 basis point improvement in operating income rate. So altogether, our Q1 performance reflects the strength of our customer value proposition and continued momentum in the execution of our strategy, and I want to thank all of our associates across the company for their hard work in delivering these results. Now I\u2019d like to discuss our progress towards Best Buy 2020 : Building the New Blue. As you may recall, last quarter, we introduced this next phase of our transformation, which is focused on shaping our future and creating a company that customers and employees love and that continues to generate a superior return for our shareholders. In March, we outlined four priorities we are pursuing during fiscal 2018. While it is early in the year, I will share some highlights of our progress thus far. The first priority is to explore and pursue growth opportunities around maximizing the multichannel retail business and providing services and solutions that solve real customer needs and help us build deeper customer relationships. We\u2019re continuing to expand several of the new concepts we\u2019ve been testing related to services and solutions. Earlier this month, we publicly announced our plan to offer a new service, Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint, in more than 400 stores by holiday. Guided by in-store experts, customers select from a suite of leading smart home products, including smart locks, lights, cameras, thermostats and more, and get expert installation, app-based system control and a 24/7 professional monitoring service. Also in the smart home area, we are curating new product categories across the home. For example, we launched during the quarter a new smart nursery assortment. More broadly, we\u2019re very focused on the smart home as a key part of our Best Buy 2020 strategy, and we will continue to enhance this category across our website and our stores this year. We also expanded the test of our new approach to tech support. Last year in Canada, we began testing a new service offering that provides 24/7 support for all of the technology products a customer owns regardless of whether they were bought at Best Buy. It also includes other valuable benefits like discounts on installation services and warranty programs. We expanded that pilot to additional markets in Canada, and we are now piloting a version of the program in a couple of U.S. markets. In our work to maximize the multichannel retail business, we expanded the pilot of our In-Home Advisor program to another major domestic market. We are currently operating in Atlanta, Austin, Orlando, San Antonio and Washington, D.C. We are now planning to roll out the program nationwide later this year. We continue to drive digital innovation, which is, of course, crucial to the success of Best Buy 2020. In Q1, online revenue reached $1 billion for the first time in a non-holiday quarter. We are pleased with our progress and believe there are plenty of opportunities to more effectively help our customers in their shopping journey. We are pursuing growth around key product categories by refining how we sell, including around emerging product categories like Connected Home; appliances, where we believe we can continue to grow share and revenue; and mobile. As it relates to mobile, we have an initiative focused on improving the multichannel shopping experience for mobile phones. The smartphone industry has significantly changed over the past few years, especially with installment billing plans, unlimited data plans and the proliferation of prepaid and unlocked devices. This can make shopping for a smartphone confusing and complicated. In response to this changing landscape, we are improving the experience on bestbuy.com and revamping the mobile departments in many of our stores to create a better, easier, more seamless shopping experience for customers. For the new phone launched last month, for example, we simplified the buying experience and provided clarity of carrier offers and ease of phone selection and saw our highest ever Android preorders. This initiative will include other enhancements such as improvements to the phone activation process, the addition of more specially trained mobile associates and new vendor displays. This work will impact several hundred of our stores by the end of Q3. The second priority for this year is to improve our execution in key areas that support our growth strategy. For example, in our stores, we\u2019re very focused on continuing to improve our sales effectiveness. We\u2019re doing this by providing systematic coaching, training and certification; increasing tenure in our store leadership roles; and lowering associate turnover, all of which is resulting in ongoing NPS improvements related to associate knowledge. We are also investing in large product fulfillments to both support business growth and materially improve the customer experience. For example, we are collaborating more closely with our vendors to improve inventory availability and in stock levels, and we are optimizing our supply chain process capabilities through standardization and training. Additionally, we\u2019re selectively adding distribution center capacity to support business growth and get products closer to the customer. The third area of focus from an execution standpoint is to reduce our exposure to excess and obsolete inventories while improving our recovery rates. By more proactively planning product transitions and better managing clearance pricing across sales channels, we materially improved our at-risk inventory position in Q1 versus the prior year, allowing us to reinvest those dollars into the new inventories our customers want. The third priority for this year is to continue to reduce costs and drive efficiencies throughout the business. We are happy to announce that during the first quarter, we achieved another $50 million in annual cost reductions and gross profit optimization. We\u2019ve now reached our $400 million target three fiscal quarters ahead of our original deadline. And so today, we are announcing a new target of $600 million in additional cost reduction and gross profit optimization to be completed by the end of our fiscal 2021. We continue to have significant opportunities to reduce costs, in particular, through the use of the continuous improvement approach, working cross-functionally to reengineer and pull costs out of complex processes. Consistent with the $400 million plan we just completed, we expect to use these cost reductions to fund investments and to offset ongoing pressures in our business. The fourth priority for this year is to build the capabilities necessary to deliver on the first three priorities, which will involve making investments in people and systems to drive growth, execution and efficiencies. For example, we\u2019ve been investing in labor expertise across our sales associates and our Geek Squad agents. We are also in the process of rolling out our new warehouse management system and beginning to improve our customer relationship management capabilities, starting with our In-Home Advisors. So in summary, we began fiscal 2018 with a strong start, and we are energized about our opportunities and the strategy we\u2019re pursuing. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help our customers in a meaningful way with our combination of multichannel assets, including our online, store and in-home capabilities, and I love how our teams are mobilized to deliver on our mission and Build the New Blue. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry, for more details on our Q1 performance and our Q2 and full year guidance. Corie Barry : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $8.5 billion, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.60, both of which exceeded our expectations. As Hubert mentioned, top line performance exceeded our expectations due to gaming, mobile and the overall general sales trend improvement throughout the quarter as consumers received delayed federal tax refunds, which primarily benefited the computing and home theater category. The better-than-expected EPS was primarily driven by better performance in the Domestic business from the flow-through of the higher revenue along with lower SG&A and a higher gross profit rate. I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1% to $8.5 billion, primarily due to an Enterprise comparable sales increase of 1.6%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.17, or 40%, to $0.60. This increase was primarily driven by a higher gross profit rate in the Domestic business, the flow-through of higher Domestic revenue and a $0.02 per share benefit from the net share count change. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.1% to $7.9 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.4%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 12 large format and 40 Best Buy Mobile stores closed during the past year. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in computing, Connected Home and gaming was partially offset by declines in tablets and, to a much lesser extent, home theater. As it relates to the home theater category, we continue to gain material market share. However, the industry was softer than recent trends, and our sales were down on a year-over-year basis. In services, the comparable revenue growth of 4.2% was primarily driven by higher warranty sales as we have now lapped the investments in services pricing from last September. Domestic online revenue of $1.02 billion increased 22.5% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 230 basis points to 12.9% versus 10.6% last year. In our International segment, revenue increased 0.3% to $616 million due to comparable sales growth of 4%, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. This growth was partially offset by an approximately 215 basis-point negative impact from lapping the $13 million Q1 FY \u201817 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio and approximately 150 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 50 basis points to 23.7%. The Domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 60 basis points to 23.6%, primarily due to improved margin rates across multiple categories, particularly appliances and home theater, and legal settlement proceeds of $8 million or 10 basis points in the services category. These increases were partially offset by margin pressure in the mobile category and the negative impact of higher sales in the lower-margin gaming category. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 140 basis points to 24.5%, driven by a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to approximately 160 basis points of negative impact from lapping the $13 million Q1 fiscal \u201817 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.72 billion or 20.2% of revenue, which was flat on a dollar basis but represented a decline of 20 basis points versus last year. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.57 billion or 19.9% of revenue, an increase of $8 million. This increase was primarily driven by slightly higher incentive compensation expenses. International non-GAAP SG&A was $149 million or 24.2% of revenue, a decrease of $8 million. This decrease was primarily driven by slightly lower administrative and payroll and benefits costs. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the first quarter in line with our expectations, which included our planned increase in the quarterly dividend and the acceleration of our share repurchase plan to $3 billion over two years. I would now like to talk about our Q2 and full year fiscal \u201818 guidance. Our second quarter guidance reflects the continuation of much of the positive category momentum we saw in the first quarter as well as the increased level of growth investments included in our initial annual guidance. For Q2 fiscal \u201818, we expect Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion and Enterprise comparable sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%. On a segment basis, we are estimating Domestic comparable sales growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% and International comparable sales in the range of flat to positive 3%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.57 to $0.62, assuming a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 36.5% to 37% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 310 million shares. This guidance range includes lapping approximately $10 million or $0.02 per share of net negative impact from the periodic profit-sharing benefit from our Domestic service plan portfolio that was recorded in Q2 fiscal \u201817. For the full year, which, as a reminder, has an extra week in the fourth quarter, we are updating our top line guidance to reflect the better-than-expected first quarter results and our second quarter guidance. We are now expecting revenue growth of approximately 2.5% versus our original outlook of approximately 1.5%. We are now expecting full year non-GAAP operating income growth of 3.5% to 8.5% versus our original outlook of 1% to 3% growth. We recognize it is early in the year, and the first quarter historically has represented approximately 15% of our annual operating income. As such, this outlook range allows for a level of flexibility as we strategically balance our pace of investments, returns from new initiatives, ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $60 million of lower profit share revenue. As Mollie noted earlier, our updated full year non-GAAP operating income growth guidance is based on the recast fiscal \u201817 non-GAAP operating income, which is $26 million or 1.5% lower than originally reported. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Alright, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Seth Sigman of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Seth Sigman : I wanted to follow up on the guidance for the second quarter. The acceleration that you\u2019re embedding here, it sounds like part of that is just based on the improvement you saw throughout the first quarter. But as you think about Q2 versus Q1, can you maybe walk us through some of the incremental drivers that would support that acceleration? Is that primarily mobile and the launch late in the quarter or other drivers to consider? Corie Barry : As we said in the release, most of it is just the continuation of the momentum that we had seen in Q1. And then, yes, you\u2019re right to call out some of the later launch of mobile, which we had said earlier would push some of that into the second quarter. So it\u2019s really continuing -- and remember, we started the first quarter incredibly soft. If you\u2019ll recall, that was part about what was embedded into the Q1 guidance. So it\u2019s really the acceleration we saw at the very end of the quarter pushing into Q2. Does that help? Seth Sigman : That does help. And then from a flow-through perspective, obviously, very strong flow-through this quarter. It\u2019s a small quarter overall, but does that reflect some of the savings that you discussed? Or is there a timing dynamic here where you were assuming lower sales initially? And then as you think about how the year will progress, guidance seems to imply an increase in growth investments, as you talked about. Are you factoring in any incremental benefits from the cost-reduction efforts that Hubert laid out? Corie Barry : Okay, I\u2019ll try to hit them both. So as it relates to Q2, it was not as much about cost reductions. That was really a balance between investments and cost reductions in the quarter. It was really more what we talked about, some of the profitability that we saw in our categories. And then, remember, I\u2019d mentioned we had a small legal settlement as well that was not expected. And so it was really about the profitability of the categories. And then you\u2019re right to call out maintaining that flat SG&A year-over-year, which was a bit of us kind of catching the trend of sales as the quarter went on. In the back half, you\u2019re right to call out that we believe we see potentially more investments. Really, for us, it\u2019s a balancing act. Hubert talked about a couple of the different initiatives that we\u2019re rolling out in the back half. And we\u2019re still working on exactly when do you roll and how do you roll, and this allows us a little bit of flexibility to make sure we do it right, that we invest appropriately and that we feel like we\u2019re really putting our best foot forward in some of these key initiatives. In terms of the cost-reduction plan we laid out, the guidance -- the cost reduction is implied in the guidance that we gave you. And so we told you, depending on the quarter, sometimes those things would offset nicely, sometimes they wouldn\u2019t. It kind of depends on what the investment profile looks like by quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Peter Keith : I was wondering, with a competitor of yours that recently liquidated and closed 220 stores, what you\u2019re seeing in markets where you may overlap with those closed stores. And if you\u2019d like to give an estimate on maybe what type of sales lift you\u2019ll see going forward from those closings. Hubert Joly : Yes. Thanks, Peter. So yes, a competitor filed last quarter, and I think they\u2019re finishing the closing of their stores. It\u2019s always a little bit choppy initially, given promotions, liquidation and so forth, but we believe we\u2019re seeing some lift in the sales in the stores, of course, around their locations in appliances and home theater. To provide some order of magnitude, their appliances and home theater business, that\u2019s about $2 billion, and we\u2019ll get a share of that. It\u2019s about 200 stores, so about 20% overlap with our stores. As you can imagine, our teams are very mobilized around maximizing our return from that opportunity, appropriate inventory level position, enhanced marketing investments and, of course, great readiness on the part of our associates to really be helpful to these customers. So we expect this is going to be moderately helpful as we look forward, and we\u2019ll, of course, update you as we move forward. Corie Barry : And keep in mind, in the $2 billion number that Hubert cited, not all of that is appliances and home theater. There are categories in there that we also don\u2019t participate in. So you\u2019ve got to kind of narrow down exactly what\u2019s available to us. Peter Keith : Okay. And then on another note, on the gross margin line, particularly in the Domestic segment, you guys have been driving very nice and consistent year-on-year improvement. I was wondering what the go-forward outlook would be. Do you think there\u2019s some sustainability in that trend? And I note that you did comment around improved product transitions and maybe some cost take-outs. And then also, just to pile on, are warranties beginning to have any impact on the gross margin at this point? Corie Barry : Yes. So I would not expect sustainability of this kind of margin expansion. To your point, we\u2019ve seen this kind of margin expansion, and on the gross profit line specifically, for a while now. We\u2019re starting to lap some of that expansion from last year. And so implied in our guidance is that we expect that to actually moderate into Q2 and then even potentially to have some pressure as we head into the back half, which is, of course, a completely different competitive environment. And a lot of that has to do with, like I said, the lapping. The other hard part is in Q1, remember, we had a positive legal settlement, and then in Q2, remember, we\u2019re lapping the profit shares from the prior year. So just sequentially between those two things, that\u2019s 25 basis points of pressure right there. And so you have to -- and we\u2019ll help model out those profit shares throughout the year, but those will continue in Q2, Q3 and Q4, where we lap all of those and they add some pressure to that gross profit line.  In terms of the warranties, EP specifically, we didn\u2019t call it out, obviously, as a key driver in our walk. It certainly is helpful to see the services side of the business grow. And we like the growth, most importantly, and we like the opportunity to serve our customers and especially, as Hubert said, specifically around mobile, where there\u2019s a really good value proposition there for people who want to keep their phones safe. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Please go ahead. Matt McClintock : Yes. Hubert, you just mentioned that you\u2019re planning on rolling out the in home advisory service to the -- nationwide later on this year. Can you maybe talk about what gives you the confidence to go forward in such a meaningful way with this program? Specifically because it requires a skill set of actually going into someone\u2019s home, and that\u2019s something that you maybe haven\u2019t necessarily done before in the past. Hubert Joly : Thank you for your question. So the -- we are operating in several markets, and we\u2019ve been operating now -- it started in San Antonio and Austin 1.5 years ago. And so we have, we feel, after the experience in these various markets, some very good indications. So first, the customer experience is great. If the need of the customer is complex, if you\u2019re redoing your home theater or if your network is -- needs to be improved, having these conversations in the home unlocks all sorts of discussions with the customers. There are some needs that people never talk about in the stores. So we feel the customer response is very, very good. We also feel, to your point about skills, that we\u2019ve been able to really hone and refine the skills requirements, the training necessary to do this right. Initially, and sometimes in these conversations, we -- when people are talking, they say, is that the Geek Squad doing this? No, it\u2019s not the Geek Squad. These are professional, consultative sales consultants and they have broad product knowledge and the ability to really uncover the underlying customer needs.  So great response from a customer standpoint; great results from a sales standpoint, because we\u2019re doing this as part of a key growth initiative. We\u2019ve also taken the time to look at the tools we need to be able to do this. So I referenced a customer relationship management system that we\u2019ll be implementing for the In Home Advisors as we move forward. Now note that we\u2019re still pacing ourselves, right? So we\u2019re going to offer this service nationwide sometime in the back half of the year. And a key variable, of course, is the number of advisers we\u2019ll have in each market, and this is something we\u2019ll tune. This is an effort where supply creates demand. And sometimes, there is lag between the time when you appoint somebody, then they have to be trained, then they have to develop the a book of business. So we\u2019re pacing ourselves. But the early indications are very positive, and it really highlights how we can leverage our various capabilities, online, the stores and going into people\u2019s homes. So candidly, we\u2019re excited, which is why we\u2019re doing this, and we\u2019ll see how big this can become. Corie Barry : And Matt, above and beyond the In-Home Advisor pilot, Hubert hit on it, we\u2019ve had excellent Geek Squad agents going into people\u2019s homes for years. And I would also highlight particularly in our Magnolia Design Centers have been doing really complex and thorough in-home work for a long time. So we\u2019ve also used those learnings to apply to this broader experience that you get from an In-Home Advisor. Hubert Joly : That\u2019s right, yes. Matt McClintock : And if I could ask one follow-up just on the new expense plan. 600 million, substantially larger than the last one at 400 million. You talked about a continuous improvement approach. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how automation plays into that and how the retail industry has a large opportunity in general to automate processes that they\u2019ve used human resources before in the past for? Hubert Joly : Corie, would you like to talk about this? Corie Barry : I would love to talk about this. So first of all, just to be clear, it\u2019s 600 million but it\u2019s over a longer time frame than the 400 million was. The 400 million was over three years. We\u2019re committing to the 600 million by the end of fiscal 2021. So just to make sure I\u2019m very clear about that. And I love how you framed the question because you\u2019re hitting exactly where we think there is potential over time. As we invest in things like In-Home Advisor and some of those more complex, interpersonal conversations, we believe there\u2019s real opportunity to take waste out of the system through automation. And there are places like our supply chain, there are places like some of our call centers where we believe we have real opportunities to become more automated, and we\u2019ve talked about this before. With the retail landscape evolving so quickly, many times, you\u2019re putting in stopgaps as quickly as you can, and you\u2019re not thinking about how to streamline it or how to automate it. You\u2019re just thinking about how to get it done and get it implemented. And now what we\u2019re finding is when you take the time to step back, get a really smart group of people together and look at how could we do this better, how could we automate it, that\u2019s the place where we\u2019re starting to see some real opportunity. So the essence of your question I think is exactly spot on to where we think there\u2019s opportunity over this next period of time. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Mike Baker : I wanted to talk about the TV category. And you said that, that was down, I believe, or at least, home theater. Was there sort of a temporary impact that you think led to that? Or is it a case of where we are in the cycle in that business? Hubert Joly : Maybe I\u2019ll start and Corie will augment. We\u2019re continuing to watch this. We continue to be excited by the TV category. There\u2019s continued innovation that keeps coming back or keeps coming online. OLED is, of course, a very significant one that we are excited about. Quarter-to-quarter, there will always be fluctuations based on when new products come in, capacity, pricing and so forth. So I wouldn\u2019t draw massive conclusions from the first quarter. This is something we\u2019ll have to watch as we get into the next quarters. There are some discussions not going to get into today as this is highly competitive. But don\u2019t take the trend of the first quarter as an indication of a strategic shift in the category. It\u2019s probably more of a transitionary nature. Corie Barry : That being said, I think our guidance would imply a more moderate view on home theater. And we\u2019re -- to Hubert\u2019s point, we\u2019re watching it closely. But I think we took a prudent stance in where we think the industry might go on this one. Hubert Joly : But we are excited that we are continuing to gain market share in that important category. Mike Baker : Sure. That makes sense, and our data shows that as well. One other unrelated question, the e-commerce business continues to grow well. Most companies have seen margins go down as e-commerce goes up. Your margins are doing better. But as e-commerce continues to grow, do you think that will start to pressure the margins just because of shipping costs and the like on that business? Corie Barry : Yes. I think that as we look to the back half, and we were talking about kind of some of that flexibility around investments, a piece of that certainly for us is continued flexibility around fulfillment in particular. And as you see the online business grow and you see the customer demands around speed and choice continue to evolve, we do believe that, over time, we need to continue to invest and make sure that we\u2019re delivering in the ways that our customers want. Obviously, when we talk about the cost reductions, we always talk about the inherent pressures in our business as a piece of what we\u2019re trying to offset. That\u2019s why we continue to believe the cost reduction is so important. It\u2019s because of the pressures that you can see in the -- not just the channel shift but in how people want to get their products and how we\u2019re fulfilling. And that\u2019s, honestly, both large cube and small cube for us. Operator : And our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Horvers : I just wanted to get some early thoughts on the back half. You\u2019ve got a number of things breaking in different directions. You\u2019ve got what\u2019s expected to be a very powerful iPhone cycle that could defer demand, but you also had inventory issues last year that I think in the third quarter was maybe a 160 basis-point headwind for you. And you\u2019re also lapping the Galaxy issue, the battery issue there. So how are you thinking about that? And maybe on those categories, what are you baking into the back half from a forecast perspective? Corie Barry : Oh, okay. So first, let\u2019s cover -- I think I jotted all this down. First, on the iPhone, honestly, there\u2019s a wide spectrum of belief in terms of how the iPhone will perform, and we know about as much as you do in terms of exactly what this phone is going to be, when it\u2019s going to launch. We said from day one, we\u2019re taking a moderate view on the iPhone launch. And in general, I -- if you just take step back, I think you have to think about, and Hubert hit on it in his prepared remarks, the changing and evolving landscape of mobile and people moving into installment billing plans, replacement cycles extending slightly as a result. I think our guidance would imply that continued kind of moderate view, and we\u2019ll update it as we know more. But at this point, that\u2019s what we have in there. You then hit on the inventory issues. In Q3, when we talked about supply, it was all about the Note and the lack of there being a Note. And in Q4, that expanded to include some other areas where we were having trouble with supply. You\u2019re absolutely right in that the guidance factors those things in. We are, at this point, assuming there is some kind of Note launch. Don\u2019t know when, don\u2019t know exactly what it is, but we\u2019re at least assuming that you can kind of fill up that hole in the bucket in what we gave you. Chris Horvers : So does that make -- I\u2019m trying to put that all together in my head. So does that make 4Q -- do you think about the cadence that makes 4Q more weighted given the inventory and perhaps the timing of the release? Corie Barry : At this point, we\u2019re not going to guide to separate quarters because here\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s so dependent on the timing of the releases, and you even saw that in this quarter, right, when we said just pushing out a few weeks given the demand that you see, particularly in that launch period, it can make a huge difference on the quarter. And so that\u2019s why, at this point, we\u2019re really just trying to talk about the back half. Chris Horvers : I understand. So I want to jump back to a previous question on the gross -- on the second quarter. You mentioned some pressures on the gross margin or, I guess, abating tailwinds. Could you run through those again? If you look back historically, your -- I think the past three years, your gross margins rate averages about 100 basis points higher in 2Q than 1Q, and presumably, that\u2019s mix driven. So what makes that not be the case this year and would suggest you should actually have higher earnings in 2Q than the first quarter? Corie Barry : Yes. Well, remember, there\u2019s a couple of things. Remember, first quarter was buoyed at least 10 basis points by a legal settlement that we had. In Q2, we\u2019re going to lap last year\u2019s profit sharing. So between those two things sequentially, you\u2019ve got 25 basis points of pressure just between those two things. Then underneath that, we\u2019ve said, and we\u2019ve cited it now for a number of quarters, we\u2019ve seen some strength in particularly home theater margins, computing margins, and we\u2019re starting to lap some of that strength that we saw. And so we believe we\u2019re going to start to see a bit of moderation. Not that you\u2019re going to give it up, but you\u2019re just going to see some moderation in our ability to gain at the pace that we\u2019ve been gaining. Operator : And our next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Dan Wewer : So I wanted to talk about real estate. It looks like selling space declined another 0.9% year-over-year. Given the success of shifting revenue to your online channel, do you see an opportunity for the real estate to perhaps close at an even faster rate going forward? Hubert Joly : We -- I think we continue to have the same view, which is ongoing optimization of the store footprint. Corie, in her prepared remarks, mentioned a number of stores that have been closed in the last year. This is an ongoing process we are managing very systematically and with great rigor on an ongoing basis. So no material change here. The stores continue to be a great asset for us. They\u2019re a great asset from the standpoint of the customer experience on the more complex categories or experiences, and they\u2019re a great asset from a shipping and logistics standpoint. So -- and as you remember, our stores are profitable. So there\u2019s no sea change that we are seeing more gradual continued evolution of our approach to real estate. Dan Wewer : Second question, you had noted the benefits of the shift in the income tax refunds. We\u2019ve -- most companies have been complaining about this as a headwind. It looks like we know where those dollars are being spent now. But just curious, how do you know that the tax refunds shift had a benefit to sales? Was it based on the timing of the refunds? And you\u2019re looking at week-to-week trends and you saw a benefit? And also, how long do you think those benefits can continue in 2Q? Is it maybe for the first half of the period or perhaps longer? Corie Barry : So if you remember, when we chatted with you guys what seems like just a little bit ago, we were seeing NPD trends in our business for the first few weeks of the quarter that were down more than 10%. The quarter ended at down about 3.2% based on NPDs, and so you can kind of read from that. As the weeks went on, we started to see this gradual shift back. I don\u2019t believe that, that continues on at any pace into Q2. I think -- we feel like we\u2019ve seen more of a normalization in our business and that the bump you kind of get when you get that nice refund check, we think we\u2019ve passed that. Dan Wewer : Last question I have. Appliance revenue is up 4%. We\u2019ve been seeing that growth rate moderate. Can you discuss what\u2019s leading to that? Presumably, the HHGregg bankruptcy would benefit appliance revenues. Hubert Joly : Well, there\u2019s the market and then there\u2019s market share. There\u2019s been, indeed, a moderation of the growth in the market. It continues to be positive, driven by what\u2019s happening in the housing sector. In the quarter, comps are in the single digits, which has been lower than what we have had historically but continue to be very positive, so we\u2019re excited about this. The HHGregg bankruptcy was more towards the tail end of the quarter, so not necessarily a huge impact in the quarter. We believe we\u2019ll continue to gain market share. And so we continue -- strategically, we continue to be excited about the sector. But you\u2019re right to underscore that, at the macro level, from a market standpoint, the growth rate has been a bit more moderate. Operator : And our next question comes from David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. David Schick : I\u2019ll ask one question so others can ask. If you think about the last several years, you worked real hard with vendors and vendors with you to sort of differentiate the store-within-a-store, and that\u2019s given you both financial benefits and I would argue merchandising or in-store experience benefits. We\u2019re moving from a hardware to a service period, smart home, et cetera. Is it fair to say that we\u2019ll see the smart home vendors, service providers, et cetera, hardware building out in the store in the same way? Are you having those conversations? Should we see another leg of both financial and merchandising or experience differentiation going forward? Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you, David, for highlighting what has been, indeed, a key driver of recovery. Clearly, being the leading -- in fact, the only national specialty retailer in the sector gives us a great asset and we are able to provide great value to our vendors, and we love the way we are partnering with them from a product development standpoint, marketing and then merchandising and in-store experience. As we move into this next phase, we\u2019ll continue to have similar partnerships. I think we\u2019ll also expand them more into the services and solutions arena. So clearly, the announcement we made just a few weeks ago around Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint is an example, a great example of that, and you\u2019ll see that in 400 stores in -- later this year. The discussions with the vendors can also get into how do we provide a more complete holistic experience to the customers, how do we work together to solve real customer needs and problems so -- and expanding what we can do into the tech support and the solutions arena. So there\u2019s a number of conversations happening in that arena. So it\u2019s going to be an addition. So we continue to do the product partnerships and expand -- and we\u2019re very interested in expanding into the services and solutions, again, with Vivint being the first good illustration of that. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Mushkin : And so I wanted to -- one of the push backs I get when I\u2019m talking to people on Best Buy is just that, historically, the TV cycle has been so important to you guys, whether it be just the TVs themselves or the warranties that go along with them. As we get into the back half of the year and maybe into next year, as 4K gets a little longer in the tooth, what would be your pushback? Hubert Joly : Scott, could you repeat your questions? Because you cut a bit in and out. So would you please repeat the question? Scott Mushkin : I\u2019m sorry about that. Yes, I\u2019ll repeat it. So basically, one of the big push backs I get regarding your business is that the TV cycle is so meaningful and that as we get longer in the tooth of this 4K cycle, it\u2019s going to have a pretty big impact as you get to the back half of the year and into next year because of the profitability of both the TVs and, I guess, especially the warranties. I was just wondering what your response to that would be. Hubert Joly : Well, maybe I\u2019ll start and Corie will augment. Guidance for the full year takes into account whatever can be expected from a TV standpoint. So that\u2019s a first response. And we, both Corie and I, commented on that earlier. So whatever pressure we are anticipating this year is reflected into this. So the fact that for the full year, we were able to grow the top line by 1% and grow our operating income rate in that context indicates that there\u2019s other factors going on and that we have a range of drivers. So home theater, we are very proud of our position and capabilities in that sector. But people have to see Best Buy as also a portfolio of categories and a franchise that rests on continuous innovation across a range of categories and a position with customers and vendors that\u2019s actually broader than the TV cycle. So the last thing I would add to amplify a comment we made earlier is that -- we\u2019ve said this several times, the TV cycle or where the TV category is these years is different from the previous cycle of moving to HD, which was a more hilly, if I can say it, transition with a deadline by which people had to upgrade. Here, you see continuous innovation. The penetration of 4K is still limited. You have a new cycle around HDR. You have a new cycle around OLED. And so there\u2019s a series of innovations that are coming in. So these are the factors -- some of the factors I would highlight on this question. Corie, anything you would add? Corie Barry : No, thank you. Scott Mushkin : So then my second question and I\u2019ll yield is just -- you guys are obviously doing some incredible stuff with like Vivint. And where is that revenue going to come in? And how is that reflected? And then, I guess, the same thing, and maybe it\u2019s more self-explanatory, when you expand out your services offering to not only the stuff you\u2019re selling but to just kind of anyone that wants to call and get someone in there to help them, does that go through comp? Is it going through services? So just kind of any thoughts both on Vivint and the other initiatives on how you\u2019re accounting for it? Hubert Joly : Again, I\u2019ll start and Corie will add. So this is a key element you are highlighting a key element of the strategy from a financial standpoint, right? During the Q1 call the Q4 call, rather, we had highlighted the financial equation we are trying to solve is grow the top line, continue to drive efficiencies and then try to develop more recurring revenue streams and stickier customer relationships to help the financial equation. So in the services and solutions space, of course, this offers the opportunity to do this. Specifically, as it relates to Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint, I want to highlight one thing, which is, given the way we are currently approaching the business with Vivint, you should assume that the bulk of the revenue recognition is going to be from the ongoing service revenue stream as opposed to the initial hardware, so which means that the top line impact is going to be very moderate. And then there is some kind of profit-sharing agreement. So it\u2019s a recurring revenue stream with profitability over multiple years. And so hopefully, that adds some color. Clearly, in fiscal \u201818, the impact on the business is going to be very moderate because we are rolling out really in the middle or the back half of the year. There\u2019s ramp-up costs and so on and so forth. So this is a case where you have the initial investment and then the in-year impact is really very moderate. Corie Barry : On your services question, keep in mind, right now, and we said it, these are pretty small pilots. In terms of how we think about the revenue there, it will flow as services revenue, and it would be a part of the services comp. But again, as we think about whether or not we\u2019re going to roll these initiatives and remember, this one is very much a test in pilot and we\u2019re learning. Not large, so you\u2019re not going to see much about it this quarter or likely next, but we will also keep some flexibility in terms of how we think about rolling out and the economics behind it as we head into the back half of this year and into next year and we get that model more refined. Operator : And our next question comes from David Magee from SunTrust. Please go ahead. David Magee : Just sort of a follow-up there on that In-House Advisor sort of revenue stream. What would be the impact you think on the EBIT line relative to your core business over time? And I know that\u2019s not really fair to ask, so maybe if you can just answer directionally. Corie Barry : Yes, thank you. I will answer directionally. First, let me make sure I clarify kind of a difference here. On the In-Home Advisor, there is no revenue associated with an In-Home Advisor visit specifically. Remember, this is a free visit from an In-Home Advisor who\u2019s going to come and help you, a consultant for you in your home. The revenue comes from what you would choose to purchase as a result of that visit, be it hardware or services. In general, Hubert alluded to the fact that and I think there was a really good question around what gives you confidence to roll this out, after now a year and half years of testing in various markets, we like the overall financial model because, of course, you do have to prove out the investment in this case since there\u2019s both people and resources going into people\u2019s homes. But in general, we like what we\u2019re seeing when we spend that time and have that marketing folks build a relationship with one of our customers. So I just wanted to make sure I was really clear. There isn\u2019t service revenue associated with the In-Home Advisor specifically. It\u2019s more what that adviser enables. David Magee : Sure. Secondly, anything on VR that might be meaningful this year? We\u2019re noticing, I guess, the in-stocks seem to be better on that product. I\u2019m not sure about the demand, though. Is it something that could be sort of a dark horse later this year? Or is this more a next year event? Hubert Joly : Yes. I would say, David, that we are excited by the fact that there\u2019s a set of emerging technologies. And it\u2019s been very interesting to see the inflow and the regular inflow of a variety of technologies, VR being one of them. You had drones. You\u2019ve had a variety of products like this. The impact of VR specifically is small, but we like the proliferation of innovation across our sectors. Operator : And our next question comes from Alan Rifkin of BTIG. Please go ahead. Alan Rifkin : So in looking at your first quarter, an incremental $85 million in revenues flowed through very nicely, which transpired into $60 million of operating income, which is really a stepwise improvement in the flow-through. Incrementally, do you believe that what\u2019s driving that, have you hit a threshold either in the warranty business or in e-commerce where -- or on the cost savings program, where you\u2019re now seeing a -- what can be expected to be continuous flow-through of magnitude similar to that? Corie Barry : Alan, thank you for the question. I think you can even see implied in our Q2 guidance, we aren\u2019t expecting that same kind of flow-through to continue. And part of that is the rate at which we\u2019re investing in some of the things that we\u2019ve talked about. Part of that is just flat out moderation in the gross profit rate expectations. Part of that is we start to lap some of the profit shares that we had last year that we had specifically called out as $60 million of pressure on the year. And so we -- you can see implied both in Q2 and even in the back half guidance, we would expect that to moderate as we come through the rest of the year. Alan Rifkin : Okay. And Corie, just... Hubert Joly : Very good -- sorry, go ahead. Alan Rifkin : And Corie, just as a follow-up, as we look at the incremental 600 million in cost reductions, which would take you close to 2 billion since the beginning of the program, would it be reasonable to assume, and granted it\u2019s over the long term, that a disproportionately greater amount of that 600 million will flow through to the bottom line? Corie Barry : It would not be appropriate to assume that. And we actually said we are going to need to take that cost out to help fund both the investments that we\u2019re making and the pressures we see in our business. And specifically, when you think about things like improving our fulfillment capabilities and -- I mean, you\u2019ve seen it. The rates at -- and pace at which change is happening in retail continues to be amazing, and we believe that cost reduction is necessary for us to reinvest in our business and make sure that we are also moving at that same pace. Hubert Joly : Very good. In conclusion, several of you have highlighted the work that goes into delivering these results and you\u2019ve been kind enough to share some compliments. Corie and I will make sure to pass these compliments to our teams. The work that everybody is putting in to continuing to move the company forward is very exciting, and I want everybody at the company to know how much we appreciate and admire the efforts and the quality of the work. And of course, we appreciate your support and your continued interest. And as promised, any technology needs, you know where to find us, and we\u2019ll find you. So have a great day. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Before I turn the call over to Hubert, I want to note that Best Buy will be holding an Investor Day on September 19th from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. Central Time. The event will be webcast live on our Investor Relations website. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin with our prepared remarks, it is important to say that our thoughts and prayers this morning are with the affected population of Texas and especially with our associates as they continue to feel the effects of Harvey. We\u2019re happy to announce that as of today, all of our associates are safe and we have mobilized to help those that have been displaced. That being said, the situation is still evolving and our primary commitment continues to be the safety of our teams. I will now provide a review of our second quarter performance and the progress we\u2019ve made against our fiscal 2018 priorities. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. We are pleased today to report strong top and bottom line growth for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We grew enterprise comparable sales by 5.4% and delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.69, up 21% compared to $0.57 last year. Our enterprise comparable sales performance was particularly strong. The strong top-line results were not isolated to a specific category or launch. We saw higher-than-expected comparable sales growth across the majority of our categories. This higher-than-expected growth was driven by stronger consumer demand for technology products and by the strong execution of our strategy. Against the backdrop of continued healthy consumer confidence, we believe broad-based product innovation is resonating with consumers and driving higher spends. And with our effective merchandising and marketing activities, combined with our expert advice and service available online, instore, and in home, we\u2019re garnering an increasing share of these dollars. On the profitability side, at the enterprise level, our operating income rate improved 20 basis points driven by sales leverage. As expected, expenses were higher than last year, as we\u2019re investing in people and systems to drive growth, execution, and efficiencies. We also had an increase in incentive compensation related to the stronger than expected performance. In fact, I want to thank all our associates across the company for their hard work in delivering these results. Thank you. Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our progress towards Best Buy 2020 : Building the New Blue, and the four fiscal 2018 priorities we outlined at the beginning of the year. The first priority is to explore and pursue growth opportunities around maximizing the multichannel retail business and providing services and solutions that solve real customer needs and help us build deeper customer relationships. In support of maximizing the multichannel retail business, we continue to drive digital innovation to improve the customer experience. In the second quarter our domestic online comparable sales grew 31%. Online sales were more than $1 billion for the second consecutive time in a non-holiday quarter and were 13.2% of domestic revenue, up from 10.6% last year. We are on pace to generate well over $5 billion in domestic online sales this fiscal year. Another exciting opportunity to maximize the multichannel retail business is our In-Home Advisor program. Our In-Home Advisors are professional sales consultants with broad product knowledge. They provide free consultations and serve as the single point of contact covering all technology needs across all vendors. In other words, they can help you design and put in place a great entertainment system, help you pick out your appliances for a kitchen remodel, or help you stream music and content across your home without annoying buffering issues. After testing the program in several cities, over the last year and a half, we\u2019re currently rolling it out nationally. By the end of September, we will be offering these free in-home consultations across all major U.S. cities nationwide. We\u2019re very focused on the smart home as a key part of our Best Buy 2020 strategy, and we will continue to enhance this category across our stores and website this year. For example, to demonstrate what is possible with voice technology, we\u2019re bringing new Alexa and Google Assistant experiences to 700 stores nationwide in collaboration with Amazon and Google. These enhanced experiences are unique to Best Buy and show how you can completely use voice technology. Specially trained Blue Shirts are on hand to provide advice and of course our Geek Squad agents can help install, set up and support the products. The new species began arriving in stores in July, and the rollout will be complete by the end of the third quarter. Of course, we\u2019re continuing to work on a number of other initiatives around tech support, smart home, mobile and appliances, and we will provide update during our investor day next month. The second priority for this year is to improve our execution in key areas. For example, we\u2019ve been intently focused on enhancing the customer experience around our appliance business. Our hard work in this area is being recognized, and I\u2019m pleased to announce that according to the J.D. Power 2017 Appliance Retailer Satisfaction Study, Best Buy ranks highest in customer satisfaction amongst appliance retailers. We also continued to drive improvements in our sales effectiveness and overall customer interactions during the quarter, improved associate availability and knowledge, as well as the service experience continued to result in higher net promoter scores. The third priority for this year is to continue to reduce cost and drive efficiencies throughout the business. As you may recall, last quarter, we reached our previous goal of $400 million. We then announced a new target of $600 million in additional annualized cost reductions and gross profit optimization to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. During the second quarter, we achieved our first $50 million towards our new goal. Consistent with our prior practice, we expect to use these cost reductions to help fund investments and offset ongoing pressures in our business. The fourth priority for this year is to build the capabilities necessary to deliver on the first three, which involves making investment in people and systems to drive growth, execution, and efficiencies. For example, this quarter, we invested in the rollout of our In-Home Advisor program including training the advisors and implementing a new customer relationship management system to help them be successful. So, in summary, our Q2 performance reflects positive tailwinds, the strengths of our customer value proposition, and continued momentum in the execution of our strategy. Due to our unique positioning in the market, we continue to outperform the industry and strengthen our position as the leading destination of technology products and services. While we do not believe that mid-single-digit comps are a new normal, we\u2019re excited about our opportunities going forward and the strategy we\u2019re pursuing. We look forward to providing more details on that strategy during our upcoming Investor Day. Finally, to all of our associates across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, again, I want to thank you for your hard work, the dedication, and your customer focus as we Build the New Blue. Without you, none of this is possible. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry, for more details on our Q2 performance, and our Q3 and full year guidance. Corie Barry : Thank you, Hubert, and good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue up $8.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.69, both of which exceeded our expectations. We saw better-than-expected top-line results across multiple categories, particularly computing, wearables, mobile, gaming and tablet. The better-than-expected EPS was primarily driven by a lower than expected non-GAAP effective income tax rate and the flow-through of the higher revenue. I will now talk about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 4.8% to $8.9 billion. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.12 or 21% to $0.69. This increase was primarily driven by the flow through of higher domestic revenue, a $0.03 per share benefit driven by our lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate and a $0.02 per share benefit from the net share count change. These increases were partially offset by higher domestic SG&A from expected increases in growth investments, higher incentive compensation expenses, and higher variable costs due to increased revenue. Additionally, we had $11 million or $0.02 per share of net negative impact from wrapping the Q2 fiscal 2017 periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 4.9% to $8.3 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 5.4%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 11 large format and 42 Best Buy Mobile stores closed during the past year. While difficult to exactly pinpoint, we believe competitor store closures resulted in approximately 30 to 50 basis points of benefit to domestic revenue growth. From a merchandising perspective, comparable sales growth in computing, wearables, smart home, mobile phones and appliances was partially offset by the declines in tablets. As it relates to the home theater category, we continue to gain material market share. However, the industry continued the recent trends we saw in the first quarter and our sales were down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Domestic online revenue of $1.1 billion increased 31.2% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher conversion rates and increased traffic. In our international segment, revenue increased 3.7% to $668 million due to comparable sales growth of 4.7%, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico. This comparable sales growth was partially offset by approximately 220 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 10 basis points to 24.1%. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate was flat year-over-year at 24% as improved margin rates across multiple categories particularly appliances, tablets and home theater were offset by margin pressure in the mobile category, the negative impact of higher sales in the lower margin wearables category and an approximately 10 basis -point negative impact from lapping the $11 million Q2 fiscal 2017 periodic profit sharing benefit. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 80 basis points to 25.1%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to lower rates in the computing and appliance categories. Now, turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.83 billion or 20.5% of revenue, which increased $58 million on a dollar basis but represented a 30 basis-point rate decline. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.67 billion or 20.2% of revenue, an increase of $61 million. This increase was primarily due to expected increases in growth investments, higher incentive compensation expenses and higher variable costs due to increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by the flow through of cost reductions. The 20 basis-point rate decrease was driven by sales leverage. International non-GAAP SG&A was $161 million or 24.1% of revenue, a decrease of $3 million. This decrease was primarily driven by slightly lower payroll and benefits costs. The 140 basis-point rate decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the second quarter in line with our expectations, which included our planned increase in the quarterly dividend and the acceleration of our share repurchase plan to $3 billion over two years. As it relates to capital expenditures, we are now expecting to spend approximately $700 million in fiscal 2018 as we have chosen to accelerate certain strategic investments in our e-commerce and supply chain functions. This was versus our previous expectation of approximately $650 million. Before I talk about our guidance, I wanted to address the ongoing storms in Texas. With Harvey continuing to do damage in the area coupled with unknown recovery time, it is nearly impossible to predict the impact this could have on our business at this time. We continue to monitor the situation, first and foremost the safety of our people in the area and secondarily, for the potential impact on our results. Should it be required, we will provide further updates on the business impact. I would now like to talk about our full year fiscal 2018 guidance, which as a reminder, has an extra week in the fourth quarter. Today, we are raising our topline guidance and are now expecting full year revenue growth of approximately 4% versus our previous outlook of 2.5%. On the profitability side, we are now expecting full year non-GAAP operating income growth of 4 to 9% versus our previous outlook of 3.5 to 8.5% growth. The full year guidance we have provided today reflects stronger than originally expected second half revenue performance with profitability roughly in line with our previous expectations for the second half. The increased top line expectations are being driven by the anticipation of continued positive industry and consumer momentum coupled with the impact of product launches. From a profitability perspective, while our original full year guidance anticipated an increased level of investments in our fiscal 2018. we have made strategic decisions to proactively make additional Q3 an Q4 investments to continue to drive the Best Buy 2020 strategy forward. Those additional investments will be in areas such as customer choice in shipping, e-commerce and our long-term strategic vision for supply chain. Additionally, our performance is expected to drive higher incentive compensation expenses consistent with what we saw in the second quarter. We believe our strong performance so far this year has us well-positioned to accelerate these investments. With the holiday season still in front of us, our full year outlook range reflects our current use of investment, returns from new initiatives, ongoing cost reductions and efficiency, and ongoing pressures in the business including the remaining approximately $40 million or $0.08 per share of lower profit share revenue we expect to receive in Q3 and Q4, which is in addition to the $25 million or $0.05 per share of pressure we lapped in the first half. As it relates to our Q3 fiscal 2018 guidance, our expectations include many of the positive consumer and industry factors I just discussed as well as the portion of the increased investment. With these incorporated, we expect enterprise revenue in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.4 billion and enterprise comparable sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.5%. On a segment basis, we\u2019re estimating domestic comparable sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 5.5% and international comparable sales growth in the range of flat to 3%. We expect to deliver non-GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations in the range of $0.75 to $0.80, assuming a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 32% to 32.5%. This assumes the diluted weighted average share count of approximately 305 million shares. This guidance range includes lapping approximately $25 million or $0.05 per share of net negative impact from the periodic profit sharing benefits in our domestic business. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : And we\u2019ll go first to Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. On these earnings calls, sort of we all get [indiscernible] saying congratulations on a good quarter, but congrats, because this is a blockbuster quarter, particularly from a top-line perspective. I guess, my question is on -- and Hubert, I certainly understand, I mean we should not expect mid-single digit comps to be the new normal. But, I guess, I was just very surprised by the comp performance given the fact that the iPhone 8 launch is coming in September. And I\u2019m particularly surprised with the fact that you called out mobile as a strong category. I guess, how did it all come together? What all came together in this quarter that we saw this significant sequence of acceleration in the comp and the best comp performance since I don\u2019t even remember when? Hubert Joly : Anthony, thank you for your very kind comments. I\u2019m going to have Corie talk about the forward-looking statements. Corie Barry : Yes. So, let\u2019s start with what kind of all came together in Q2 and what really performed. If you look at really where we saw some changes in trajectory, we had a couple of things happen. One, the NPD tracked categories, which again represent about little over 60% of our business, were up 1.1% versus down 3.2% in Q1. And particularly, there we saw strength in computing, which accelerated across the industry as well as slightly less bad results in tablets, if that makes sense. We saw that trajectory change on us. It still was a drainer, but it wasn\u2019t quite as bad as what we\u2019ve seen in Q1. On top of that, we also said we saw some strength in wearables which is not an NPD, and we saw, to your point, some strength in the mobile business. And really, a lot of that was around some of the offers that were specific to Best Buy and some of just the underlying strengths, not just the new launches but in some of the older generations of phones as well. We offered our customers choice across a myriad of price points and different releases. As we look forward into Q3, we definitely would expect some of that trajectory to continue in mobile. And remember, the biggest change year-over-year in mobile is the fact that we believe there\u2019s going to be a note, and that that will fill the hole that we had last year, and that maybe some of those other massive trajectory changes might abate just a bit as we head into Q3, and we have more interest likely on some of the new handheld devices. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle : Great, thanks very much for taking the question. I guess, kind of continuing on the subject of comps, understanding that given you\u2019re probably not going to maintain a mid-single-digit comps in perpetuity. But just looking at 4Q, it does imply that -- I think that there is a bit of a slowdown. And looking at the compares, there were big product shortages last year and we now have what looks like a pretty decent mobile cycle. I would expect to be a little more strength I suppose. Is it just reflective of maybe some conservatism on your part or something else? Corie Barry : So, thank you for the question. Q4 -- so, let\u2019s just start first of all with the nature of Q4. Q4 obviously is not necessarily comparable to our other quarters. You\u2019ve seen that even in our prior year. We\u2019re happy that we were able to raise and now expect growth of approximately 2% across Q3 and Q4. So, we like that. The trick about Q4 is you can\u2019t always carry the trends of the business forward into Q4 and it\u2019s a highly competitive quarter. Obviously, there is still a lot of unknowns around launches and availabilities. And so, right now, based on the information we have in front of us, we felt like, the Q4 was well positioned, we do still feel like it\u2019s still open at the hole that was left by the notes and we feel like it carries some level of mobile strength forward but accounts for just the changing dynamic of how sales flow in the quarter, given the highly promotional nature and competitive nature of the quarter. Curtis Nagle : Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up if I may. What\u2019s driving such strong performance in the gaming business that at least by my calculation, it looks like you\u2019re double what the industry is doing at the moment. Corie Barry : Thank you for the question. We feel like we\u2019re performing quite well in the switch, in particular that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the gaming category right now. We were happy with our performance over the quarter. We felt like we were well positioned, had good allocations, performed slightly better than we thought. That being said, obviously, we didn\u2019t list it as one of our largest comp -- weighted comp drivers, so it\u2019s good, and we like the change in the trajectory still given like Hubert said, we saw strength across a multitude of categories. And so, we like the switch right now. And again, as you think about what changes in Q4, I think you have to recognize the competitiveness around gaming hardware in particular and whether or not this kind of growth rate continues through Q4 broadly. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. Good morning, nice results, everyone. My question is about investments, somewhat around Best Buy 2020. I know -- I don\u2019t want to preempt what we\u2019re going to talk about in September. I want to talk about I guess what investments you wouldn\u2019t have made or had at the top line or what would have gone slower? And just thinking about the flow-through of this business, because we\u2019re used to a very significant and strong flow-through. Granted, you are pulling some things forward, but does Best Buy 2020 at least in the early days require a greater level of investment that even when we -- let\u2019s get back to a new normal of comp, I don\u2019t know 1 to 3 whatever we get to next year, doesn\u2019t provide the same type of flow-through that we\u2019ve been used to seeing for the past several years? Hubert Joly : Yes, so we\u2019ll be happy Simeon. We\u2019ll be happy to provide some more color and details on the growth opportunities and the kind of investments that are needed. At the highest level, the investments we\u2019re talking about in are people. So, if you take In-Home Advisor, clearly, we\u2019re adding people, we\u2019re training these people. This is a compensation level that\u2019s higher, and then we\u2019re equipping them with tools. For example, one of the great tools that they are actually very excited about is a new CRM system, customer relationship management system that we\u2019ve invested in and that we\u2019ll continue to invest in. From a savings standpoint, clearly, your first -- assigning these new associates and training in the month of July and then investing of course in the development and the rollout of the system. And then, there is a lead time before they can be [ph] productive, because it takes time to develop a book of business. The sales cycle tends to be slightly longer in this business. And of course, as it builds a portfolio of customers and deeper relationship, it takes time to ramp up. So, that\u2019s an example of kind of investments we\u2019re talking about. The revenue profile also on some of the initiatives we\u2019re talking about, in particular in the recurring revenue streams, related to services, this is something we\u2019ll have to walk you through; the profile is different from product sales. So, we\u2019ll try to provide as much detail as possible when we meet. But, yes, you\u2019re right, there is a phasing of these things. At the highest level, what we feel as a management team is that there is -- we have an opportunity rich environment. We have momentum. We feel our value proposition is resonating with customers. So, this is the time, play to win and invest in the context where we continue to focus on the cost takeout, which itself requires some investments. Corie, would you like to add some more details? Corie Barry : I would just build just a little bit on what you said. I think we\u2019ve said it before. You\u2019re going to see fluctuations quarter-to-quarter because as exactly Hubert stated, you\u2019re not going to see the perfect timing between the investments and the return on those investments. That being said, we\u2019ve also said out loud, we would expect the increases in operating margins to moderate over time. And, I think in general, everyone would want that as we reinvest into the business and make sure we remain competitive and remain differentiated in the marketplace. And so, we\u2019ll try to kind of guide you through what we think the puts and takes are going be on any given quarter. But broadly, I think we would expect the operating margin, just large increases that you\u2019ve been seeing, moderate. And we even had said that last quarter. Simeon Gutman : Great. Can I just ask one follow-up? If you take the entire investments that you have planned, let\u2019s say for the next couple of years, how much of that on a percentage can you pull forward? Just to give us a gauge of -- when you -- if you comp these 5 plus going forward, how much of that investment could we see actually lay on ahead of the payoff? Corie Barry : Yes. So, we\u2019re not going to provide the long-term forward-looking guidance right now, but suffice it to say, we\u2019re trying to make the best possible current decisions, given the climates that we\u2019re operating in, to invest in those things that we think will help us next year and the year after and return as quickly as possible. And so, wherever we think we can and we think we have the right business case, we\u2019re trying to pull those forward. And it\u2019s evolving, frankly, every week as we were more about some of the pilots and initiatives that we\u2019ve talked to you about. Operator : We will go next to Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matthew Fassler : Thanks a lot and good morning. I want to talk about two outliers that are positive and then maybe one of the only softer numbers in the print [ph] and that is the surge you had in the online business and then the small step back that you had in the services comp even as you are ramping up some of these really interesting innovative service offerings. So, if you could speak to each of those would be great? Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you. Online continues to be an area of growth. It\u2019s been a key area of focus for us since we first launched Renew Blue. So, much of the customer experience has been starting online. So, what we\u2019re seeing today is a continued effect of the cumulative investments we\u2019ve made in simplifying and streamlining the customer experience. There is a lot of details that you do to tweak and eliminate the frictions in logging and checkout every step in the journey. And then, the drive times also have been pretty strong for us in the months of July. We have Black Friday in July event that was quite strong. The Prime Day was also quite strong for us, as well as our teams mobilized around these drive times. So, continued momentum, and we imagine that --we\u2019re working to continue to drive these results knowing that our online strategy is not just about the online channel [indiscernible] and then there is the synergies between the two channels where we\u2019re uniquely positioned to help the customers in a unique way. So, you will see us continue to invest as a priority in digital and in general. As it relates to services, the services line in our comps is one of the hardest to track, in particular because of the way the accounting works for the extended warranties. And so, there is a difference between product sales numbers and the GAAP numbers. This is probably too much detail but there are all sorts of difference. Point of sales number is actually better than the GAAP number, and we\u2019ll be happy to provide any kind of offline tutorial on that. The other thing that\u2019s driving services, and again we\u2019ll have to talk about it during the investor day, we\u2019re shifting the business in services. Historically, a big part of our services revenue were the extended warranties. And they provide a very meaningful service to customers. I myself recently bought a dishwasher and I benefited from the service. But, we are focused on innovating in the service arena, in particular around what we tech support where we support all of the customers -- all of the products that customer has in their home through an ongoing subscription service. The revenue recognition of this is different. You don\u2019t recognize all of the revenue upfront; you recognize it over time. And as you know, we\u2019ve rolled out this service in Canada and we are piloting it in U.S. This will have an effect; it\u2019s purely GAAP versus cash flow. So, the cash flow doesn\u2019t change, but it has an impact as well. So, these are some of the puts and takes. It\u2019s harder to read than we would like. But, we continue to believe, generally speaking, that technical services as well as what we call, managed services or solutions like what we have with have Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint; recurring revenue drivers will be a good contributor to our future. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning. I was hoping you could provide us some additional color regarding the product mix differences between store sales and e-com sales today as well as the best way to think about the profitability impact of the e-commerce growth because obviously it\u2019s -- over half of the total comp growth is coming from e-commerce. Thanks. Corie Barry : Yes, absolutely, great question. So, the mix difference is between store and e-com, really not quite as pronounced as they historically were but there are obviously some key categories that are pre-underpenetrated online. I would use mobile as an example, where we are continually working on evolving our mobile experience. But so much of what you need to do or want to do to transfer data and understand your phone is much more of a physical experience than it is an easy digital one. We tend to still over-index in some of what you would consider smaller cube, overseeing nice growth in some of the areas where people get more and more comfortable around large cubes. So, that the mix isn\u2019t quite as different as it used to be but there are definitely some underpenetrated areas like mobile that creates a difference in the product assortment. In terms of profitability, and we\u2019ve talked about this before. Obviously, the biggest profitability difference between the two channels for us is around services and accessories, and a bit of a different profile online versus in-store. So, I don\u2019t consider that just natural product that\u2019s a bit of like the other things you need to complete your solutions. But, the teams have done a really exceptional job working on that customer experience in a very frictionless way online, but also letting people know what it is they need in addition to their product purchase, so just make the stuff work when they get home. And so, what\u2019s happened is while we mixed into the business and that does put some pressure on the margins, the teams have done a nice job improving the rates in the channel. And so kind of the mix rate at the end of the day is shaking out to be way less impactful than I think some others are seeing in the space. Scot Ciccarelli : So, Corie, is it fair to assume that it\u2019s some pressure but not as much as it had been, say 12 to 18 months ago, simply because the rate within e-commerce channel is improving? Corie Barry : Yes, I think that\u2019s fair. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Dan Binder with Jefferies. Dan Binder : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on a great quarter. My question was really two-fold. First, around investments. You broadly described the incremental investments that you\u2019re making in supply chain and I think shipping. I was wondering if you could just detail for us a little bit more what those things are specifically. And then, within the quarter, what was the main buckets for the $50 million in cost reductions? Corie Barry : So, on the investment side of things, we\u2019re not going to put every detail on the table, because we think some of them are pretty strategic in nature. But in general, think about this as on the supply chain side, us continuing to evolve our supply chain infrastructure strategically to enable obviously faster shipping when the customer wants and expects it. And so, we\u2019re putting some work behind the scenes on how do we need to continue to evolve both our partnerships and just our infrastructure to enable speed and choice when the customer wants it. But because as much in CE, [ph] it\u2019s much about choice and making sure that you\u2019re there and you feel comfortable about your product, potentially sitting on your front porch, if you\u2019re not there to receive it. On the cost reduction side, and the buckets that we\u2019re seeing there, we\u2019d hit on last time how we\u2019re really working hard to make this next round of cost reduction a little bit more about process and process improvements. And some of the places that we\u2019re actually seeing this last 50 million are around -- and they\u2019re actually some things that we\u2019ve talked about before, returning, replacements and damages and more things through -- particularly some of our recycling programs. We\u2019ve seen some nice improvements internationally from our business in Canada where they\u2019ve done some of the same work that we\u2019ve started here in the U.S. And we\u2019ve actually seen some other nice benefits from optimization in areas like marketing and some other areas where we\u2019re using some of this process to help pull out cost and at the same time allow us to reinvest. Dan Binder : Okay, thanks. And just as a follow-up, you talked a little bit about trends in home theater and the industry being softer. I was wondering if you could just detail little bit for us what you did see in TV unit ASPs and how that compare to the industry numbers that you follow? Corie Barry : Yes. So, like I said in the prepared remarks, we saw similar to Q1 performance across the industry. I think what changed a little bit is that we definitely, industry-wide, saw units down and ASPs up a bit. And for us, what we liked is again our positioning in the marketplace, as we\u2019re able to cater to a little bit more of that premium assortment and some of the more branded products and the higher end tiers. But the industry numbers that we saw were actually very similar to Q1, just a bit of a difference in composition as we saw a little bit more softness in units industry-wide and a little bit better ASPs. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Kate McShane with Citi Research. Kate McShane : Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering with regards to your testing of the in-home advisor services. Have you talked at all about the comp lift to the stores in those areas where the tests were conducted? Hubert Joly : Good morning, Kate. We\u2019ve not talked publicly about the list on the stores in the various pilots there have been different approaches in terms of the density of the in-home advisors. So, in some markets we had one in-home advisor per store; in other markets, it was one per several stores. What is very encouraging is that every incremental IHA we have is actually providing a great customer experience and then, [indiscernible] themselves very nicely, immediately and then over time. As we deploy this program next month in September, this will be available nationwide. We\u2019ll have a number of IHAs across the country and we\u2019ll talk about it next month. We then will pace ourselves to see how many we add over time. There is an internal debate at the companies how big is this going to be. The good thing about this is that individually they are profitable and then this is a case where supply creates demand. So, at this point, I\u2019m not going to give you today the elements to model this, but this is incrementally positive. And the big question is how many in the end will we have because the impact on the business is different if it is 250 in-home advisors nationwide versus 1,000 or more, and we\u2019ll know this only after ramping this up. This will be a gradual ramp up of the number of IHAs, in-home advisors over time. The summary today is it\u2019s a great customer experience, very exciting job opportunities for the associates, because it\u2019s a professional sales career and we like the economics. Kate McShane : Thank you. And I can ask one quick follow-up question with regards to the new relationship with Google and Alexa that you mentioned. I think you said that they would be Blue Shirts but will there be any employees from the vendors involved in that endeavor? Hubert Joly : Kate, thank you. Yes, we\u2019re very excited about continuing to partner with some of the world\u2019s foremost tech companies and in particular in the smartphone area and in particular around the voice. In case of Google and Amazon, these are Best Buy associates; there is no vendor labor and there is both Blue Shirt -- dedicated Blue Shirts especially trained with demos in the stores. It\u2019s a good opportunity to really understand what you can do with these products, and then of course the Geek Squad able to install setup and support. So, great customer experience by Best Buy employees. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : So, first question I had just with respect to the gross margin trend. So, would you speak -- despite the strong sales result, gross margins tick lower here, in the second quarter. So, I know Corie, I know you just said in your prepared remarks, but just if you could go over again what changed from the gross margin perspective going from earlier this year and into this quarter? And then, how should we think about that trajectory into the back half of the year? Corie Barry : Yes. Thank you for the question. I think in terms of what happened in Q2, it actually was very much in line with what we expected. Ticked down a bit enterprise wide but flat domestically. And that was while we lapped just over 10 basis points of impact from the AIG profit sharing the year prior. If you look back at the prepared remarks, here a couple of things changed. One, the wearables category really performed well for us. And we\u2019re very pleased with that, but it has a bit of a lower margin profile and therefore the mix had an impact on the business. And in general, we had said, we expected some of the massive GP increases that we had been seeing over time, to start to moderate. And that\u2019s a little bit of what we saw. So, there wasn\u2019t -- I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as anything really unusual in the gross profit. And in terms of how we think about that going forward. Obviously, we\u2019re lapping even larger AIG profit sharings in Q3, but we\u2019d expect kind of the same general flattish type of margin performance, gross profit performance in Q3 as we saw in Q2 with kind of similar continuing product composition. Brian Nagel : Got it. Just to be clear from a promotional standpoint in the sector; that was not a factor in Q2? Corie Barry : I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat the first part of that? Sorry. Brian Nagel : Sorry. Just to be clear, so from the standpoint of promotions within the sector, promotional activity, that was not a factor. So, the heightened promotions were not a factor in Q2? Corie Barry : I would not characterize that as a driving factor of the overall profitability. Brian Nagel : Got it. And then, my follow-up question, this is obviously a lot of moving parts here with the different products and the launches coming. But, as we look at the guidance you now have for the second half of the year, what\u2019s baked in there with respect to the potential in the iPhone 8, the TV category, some of your [indiscernible] particular driving categories for holiday season? Corie Barry : So, I\u2019ll try to hit on it a couple of things. One, obviously, we\u2019re assuming there are phone launches, we\u2019re assuming there is a Note launch and that that phone is a viable phone for the back half. We\u2019re assuming there is an iPhone 8 launch and that is also a viable phone for the back half. And obviously, we have to kind of draw the line in the sand in terms of when we think those things are launching but we\u2019ve made assumptions based on the best information possible. In terms of the TV category, we\u2019re assuming the industry performance continues on a similar trajectory that we\u2019ve been seeing. So, we baked that in. Obviously, again, the holiday season being a little trickier, we\u2019re doing the best we can to project both our own and our competitors\u2019 positioning. But, we\u2019re assuming that also continues. And then, I touched gaming little bit earlier, expecting potentially a little bit of moderation. And just remember, gaming becomes a smaller part of our business, percent of our business as we head into Q4; it\u2019s a highly competitive part of the environment. And so, again, we\u2019re trying to take our best account of where we think we\u2019ll be positioned, where our competitors will and we\u2019re pushing that forward also into the back half. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Given your comments about the operating margin expansion starting to crash [ph] and the fact that in 2Q, your SG&A was heavily influenced by increased incentive comp and higher variable costs. Looking out over the next couple of years, will your operating profit dollars just start to flow more consistently with your sales? And what\u2019s the risk that you\u2019ll increasingly need to deploy more investments in order to drive sales such that margins might even start to contract over time? Hubert Joly : Yes. So, we\u2019ll talk about the strategy, and the best outlook we can give you next month. But at the highest level, consistent with what we\u2019ve said before, as we go into Best Buy 2020, as we assess the opportunity we have to increase the gap with competition, the opportunity we have to play to win, we feel that number one priority in this phase is to see how we can gradually accelerate our revenue growth. We\u2019ve laid out the economic equation we\u2019re trying to solve. We continue to be committed to efficiencies, so that we can fund investments. We do not see at this point, driving the profit margin rate, the operating income rate as a priority. We think that this is a time -- it would not be realistic in this environment to assert this. We think that we\u2019re proud of the fact that operating income rate in fact has been increasing over the last little while and continues to increase this quarter. But we don\u2019t see it as a strategic priority to drive profit margin rate, we see it as a priority to increase the differentiation from a customer experience, drive the top-line growth, play-to-win in a time where I think the separation between winners and losers becomes increasingly clear. So, from a long-term perspective, that\u2019s how we are thinking. In the short-term, you\u2019ve seen us be very responsible. We\u2019re not going overboard where we\u2019re pacing ourselves. And when we see that things are going well, we tend to accelerate our investments. So, that\u2019s how we are thinking about it; more to come next month. Michael Lasser : And my follow-up question is, can you frame the impact from the decline in gross profit margin rate for the mobile category? And is this decline happening because of the changing economic profile of the category and do you expect that that\u2019s going to continue? Corie Barry : Yes. So, I think there are a lot of pieces that play in mobile. Some of it is absolutely, as you\u2019re alluding to, is just the evolution of the category of a more mature category, definitely with installment billing, people realize just how much their phone costs and in some cases are sweating assets or thinking about different ways to buy phones. You have phones that are also just offering forms and features that used to be supplied by accessories, things like submersibility in water or glass that is much less breakable. And so, I think you\u2019ve seen us talking about mobile actually as gross profit rate is attractive for a few quarter now and a lot of those different dynamics at play in the margin profile. That being said, it\u2019s still a fantastic category for us. And obviously, there is still a lot of consumer interest in it. And to what you\u2019ve been talking at, a lot of launches yet in front of us. And so, while the profit rates of the category have seen some pressure, as frankly you\u2019d expect for any category as it matures to this level, overarchingly we still really like the business. Michael Lasser : And can I just follow up on that? As those new launches roll in, how is that going to impact the profitability of the category? Corie Barry : In general, I would expect this to continue to be a category where we\u2019re going to see some profit rate pressure. And we\u2019ve actually baked that into the guidance that we gave you today. Operator : We\u2019ll go to next to David Schick with Consumer Edge Research. Q - David Schick : I wanted to get your thoughts on smart home products and services. In aggregate, as you look at the customers you\u2019re helping in those parts of the store, are those the existing customers of Best Buy or are you bringing somebody new? Anything you could tell us about how merchandising changes and service addition changes are evolving the customer base would be very helpful. Thank you. Hubert Joly : So, on the customer base, the Best Buy customer, our target customer, we\u2019ve talked about this, is a -- we call them the high touch tech fans. These are people who are passionate about technology and need a bit of help with us and that includes many of us. Incidentally, many of them are millennials. In fact, half of that target customer segment is millennials and we tend to do well with millennials. Our penetration of millennials is actually higher than some of the other demographics. So, the typical customer for the smart home, I don\u2019t think varies significantly from the rest of the store. One of the things we\u2019re excited about from the trend standpoint is the fact that the millennials are finally leaving their parents\u2019 home and investing in their new home. And of course because they are more digitally savvy, they tend to spend more. So that\u2019s one of the positive trends and opportunities that we can think about, which is also exciting as it -- stores with the merchandising solution and the partnerships, we\u2019ve talked about, provide a unique opportunity to get help, because there is a lot of device proliferation in that space and finding out what to buy, what is compatible, what works together, what use cases that\u2019s Best Buy is a great designation. In fact, I would assert the best destination in the country where you can get that advice. So, again, there is opportunity, typical customer, excited about the trends, in particular surrounding the millennials and a great destination for these customers. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matt McClintock : Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if we could focus on the computing segment. Two quarters in a row, it\u2019s driven or led comp store sales. And just looking forward and trying not to get into guidance for next year. But looking forward, could you talk about the broader trends that\u2019s driving that and the sustainability of those trends into next year and beyond? Thank you. Hubert Joly : So, I\u2019m going to start and Corie can amplify it. One of the things that has been a key factor for us, and it\u2019s always harder to predict what\u2019s there happen, but to what that is driving the business is the fact that the computing category has seen meaningful product innovation in the last several quarters in large part driven by the great collaboration that our merchant teams have with the key vendors, in particular in the Windows environment. There was recently, I think maybe two weeks ago by the way sort of product reviews in the Wall Street Journal where the gentlemen highlighting the excitement about these new products, there\u2019s been the creation of a premium category for laptops in particular with features and functionalities that people love. This is a great example of innovation combined with a great shopping experience driving demand, and then us doing quite well in that context with the ability to provide help and service and advice to customers. So, to your point, yes, we\u2019re not going to go into guidance for next year. But, this is a great example of product innovation and vendor partnerships, and the great customer experience in the stores and online driving the revenue performance. Matt McClintock : And then, if I could ask a follow-up on that, just as you transition the business model to more services, service-based retailing or however you\u2019re going to explain it to us at the analyst day. How should we think about that from a product category standpoint? I mean, are there some categories that just lend themselves naturally to providing more services than others, and could you maybe just preview or give us a little insight into how to think about that? Hubert Joly : Yes, I think -- to be clear, from a revenue standpoint, we\u2019re going to continue to see the vast majority of our revenues coming from products. And in some cases, the service approach we offer actually produces no immediate service revenue. If I take the In-Home Advisor program which you could say is a kind of service or it\u2019s a consultative service, that\u2019s a free value proposition that does not therefore generate immediate service revenue, that generates product revenue and then service revenue in the form of installation and then support. But bear in mind that the vast majority of our revenue is going to continue to be products. Where we play really with these approaches is when there is complexity. So, we tend to do really well when we\u2019re dealing with complex systems, large cube, high touch solutions where if you need to design a smart home solution, if you need to design a music streaming solution throughout your home, as I was explaining, that tends to be a forte, either because of our in-home channel, particularly well positioned to do this or in the stores, the great place for discovery, support and service and advice. So, at this point, I would leave it at this, but continued to focus on products and striving when -- it\u2019s a matter of helping customers and helping them imagine what\u2019s possible and then making it happen for them. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our final question from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer : Thanks. One of the benefits of your significant online market share growth is the ability to close some of the less productive retail stores. I believe your selling space is down about 0.7% year-over-year. What do you think is the minimum number of large format stores that Best Buy made in the U.S. to support the omni-channel strategy? Hubert Joly : I think that our view of the store portfolio has been very consistent since we began. We have a great store footprint, great locations throughout the U.S.; the vast, vast majority of our stores are profitable. And we\u2019ve always said that we would have a gradual optimization of the store footprint. Instantly, when we grow online revenue, we don\u2019t see it as a great way to close stores, we\u2019re not excited about closing stores. In fact, our focus is on growing the Company across the various touch points. Some of the online growth is cannibalistic, some of it is not. And so, we\u2019re here to drive this. We\u2019ll provide -- Corie will provide the latest thinking on the store portfolio at the Investor Day but this is -- since the beginning, it\u2019s not being the store shrinking strategy this has been a customer focus, how can we help you to get a great customer experience strategy. Corie Barry : And again, keep in mind, we always try to remind people so much of what we do online is enabled by the stores with 50% of it either picked up in or shipped from a store. And so, the goal at the end of the day is to make the store as productive as possible, not closing. Dan Wewer : Just as a follow-up, there was interesting article in today\u2019s Wall Street Journal comparing your In-Home Advisor approach to Amazon. I was curious, what in your test, I believe you\u2019re in five markets now or headed in five markets, what triggers the customer making an appointment for an In-Home Advisor? Is it their visiting the store and then being made aware of the service or is it something that they\u2019re seeing online and then triggering the appointment? Hubert Joly : Yes. So, today, we are in five markets; next month, we\u2019ll be in all major cities throughout the U.S. To your point, the way that people have learned about this service today other than listening to our investor calls has been through the in-store experience. So, typically, what will happen is that as the customer goes into the stores and having a conversation with an associate, the associates says or feels given what you are trying to accomplish might be easier, if we send somebody to your home to have a better conversation about, what\u2019s you\u2019re trying to accomplish and then what\u2019s possible. And then, there is a referral to the in-home associate or advisor that then goes to the home. As we run this up, we will ramp up the awareness building activities. So, the customers will be made aware of this on our own vehicles of the sites and emails and any other vehicle we choose to use. We expect also that word of mouth is going to work very nicely. In the Orlando markets, there is one of the in-home advisors, Jessica has built a reputation for ourselves in one of the communities there, and neighbors talk about her and are queuing up to get her service. So, word of mouth is a great example. And then as the recurring lifelong relationships you build, this is a situation where supply creates demands and over time you are going to build this. So, we\u2019re going pace our way into this but that\u2019s where we are today. Dan Wewer : Okay great thank you. Hubert Joly : Thank you so much and thank you all. In closing, of course we look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on September 19th here in Minnesota, great time of the year to visit. We thank you for your continued support and interest. And of course we at Best Buy here are especially thankful to our employees across the U.S., Canada and Mexico that made these results possible and are working hard to build the New Blue. Thank you again and have a great day. See you soon. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you, Mollie and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with a review of our third quarter performance, briefly discuss holiday and then review some of the progress we're making against our Best Buy 2020 : Building the New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. So today, we are reporting strong top and bottom line results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018. We grew Enterprise revenue 4.2% to $9.32 billion, which is a 4.4% Enterprise comp, and we increased earnings per share 30% to $0.78 compared to $0.60 last year. These results include the negative impact of 2 significant factors. First, despite what we characterize as moderate expectations for mobile phone launches in the quarter, revenue in the mobile category was materially lower than expected. This was due to the fact that a major new phone did not start selling until November, which is the first month of our fourth quarter. This resulted in significant softness in sales of existing mobile phone models in October as customers delayed their purchases. The related revenue impact in the quarter was more than $100 million. Second, like most retailers, we felt the impact of the natural disasters in South Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Our first priority during these disasters was, of course, the safety and well-being of our associates in the affected communities, and we're happy to share that all of our associates are safe even though some of them suffered material losses. We estimate the negative impact to our Enterprise comparable sales was 15 basis points to 20 basis points, and that with the related costs, including insurance, deductibles, repairs and employee-related pay, our earnings were negatively impacted by approximately $0.03. Now despite these two factors, the results we are announcing today are within the earnings guidance we shared in August and are strong in absolute terms. Earlier this year, we announced the launch of our growth strategy, Best Buy 2020 : Building the New Blue. And well, we're growing. In fact, year-to-date, our revenue growth rate is 3%. This is materially above what we had guided at the beginning of the year. Technology innovation is fueling demand, and our strategy is resonating with our customers. And while we are investing in key initiatives and capabilities, we're also able to generate significant returns for our shareholders through the growth of our EPS and our capital allocation strategy. As such, I want to thank all of our associates for their great work in delivering these results. I am incredibly proud of the collective and individual talent, the heart and the soul of this organization. Looking ahead, we are excited about our plans for holiday. Our teams across all functions are ready and keen to take care of our customers online, in our stores or in the customer's home. We have a curated assortment of great new products across multiple categories, including smart home, phones, gaming and tech toys. We have a compelling promotional calendar with strong brand messaging. We are, again, this year, offering free shipping with no minimum, and we're offering a range of new capabilities, including our new In-Home Advisor program now available nationwide, an updated gift center and same-day shipping in 40 cities. So while we are, as always, thoughtful about product availability during the fourth quarter, we're increasing our top line and bottom line guidance both for the fourth quarter and, again, for the year. Now we'll review some of our progress in the implementation of our Best Buy 2020 : Building the New Blue strategy. We are excited by the opportunities we have in this next chapter to develop deeper and stickier relationship with our customers and build a strong, vibrant, growing company with significant competitive advantages. We are committed to building a company that can thrive in both today's and tomorrow's environments. As we laid out at our Investor Day in September, Best Buy 2020 is designed to take advantage of key growth opportunities by expanding what we sell and evolving how we sell. The work we're doing in the smart home space is a great example of how we are expanding what we sell. We plan to build on our leading position in the smart home market by continuing to expand our curated assortment, demonstrating new technology solutions in a meaningful way and expanding in the solutions and services part of the market. We believe needs-based demonstrations and experiential merchandising are critical, and we have a unique capability to showcase the products, both online and in store. In this spirit, as we head into holiday, all of our stores have enhanced smart home departments. In addition, as previously announced, 700 stores have new Alexa and Google experiences developed in collaboration with Amazon and Google and 450 stores have a Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint home automation and security offering. To complement all of this, we've added an incremental 1,500 dedicated smart home store employees to make sure that when you come to shop with us, we'll do a great job identifying what smart home solution would work best for you. As we discussed at our Investor Day, as a natural offshoot of our smart home focus, we are testing opportunities to leverage technology to help the rapidly growing segment of aging seniors stay in their homes as long as possible. We're piloting a service called Best Buy Assured Living that uses a non-invasive set of smart home connectors and sensors to help adult children remotely check in on the health and safety of their aging parents. Aging parents also benefit from the increased automation in their home such as connected door locks and smart lighting. We're very early here, piloting the opportunity in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul and in the Denver market. As it relates to supporting customers, we're also focused on expanding what we sell. We believe that customer support needs are not limited to a specific product. The need now is to have all of their technology working together to improve and simplify their lives as promised. Total tech support is a new Geek Squad offering that provides support for all of the customers' technology no matter where or when they bought it. This support is available to customers 24/7 via online, in store and phone and includes significant discounts if in-home services are needed. In September, we expanded the pilot to just over 200 stores across 10 cities in the U.S. Meanwhile we are evolving how we sell to focus not only on selling products but also on solving customers' underlying needs. We see material opportunity in our ability to continue to improve the customer experience within and across channels. Almost all of our customers currently use both the store and the online channel, and they have different expectations on what the channels should do for them depending on their mindset. As an example, customers often use the online channel when they are most certain about their purchase and the store channel when they are less certain. In our online channel, we've made a great deal of progress and have driven innovation, and we continue to see strong growth in online sales. In Q3, we grew online sales 22% to $1.1 billion, which is now 13% of our Domestic revenue. We've also significantly improved the in-store experience as evidenced by increased NPS scores and our revenue growth. Going forward, we see continued opportunity in examining how customers use the various channels in their shopping journey and designing and linking experiences across channels. Ultimately, this makes it easier for customers to start their shopping process online and finish it in the store or vice versa. We are notably using this approach to more effectively address customer needs in areas where we have significant growth potential, particularly appliances and mobile phones. In appliances, for example, where a significant portion of sales are the result of broken appliances that need to be replaced, we are making it clear to customers searching online which appliances are available realtime at their local store for those customers who'd like to replace very quickly. In mobile, we're enhancing the online experience to smooth pre-orders and streamline phone choice, allowing customers to do most of the work online before they pick up their phone in store for activation. We're also improving the in-store experience to make the various carrier pricing options more clear, reducing the time it takes to activate a phone and using text alerts for clarity on the timing of activation. We're also focused on building our in-home channel. To that end, in September, we expanded our In-Home Advisor program to all major U.S. markets with 300 advisers. The In-Home Advisors are professional sales consultants with broad product knowledge, who have completed an extensive five week training program. They provide free consultations and serve as a single point of contact for customers covering all technology needs across all vendors. Our advisers are still ramping up, and we continue to be pleased with the results of the program. In fact, based on the early results, we're planning to expand the number of advisers to 335 by early next year based on initial demand. To deliver on our strategy, we're investing in a range of enablers. We have built a great set of assets over the past several years, and we're expanding on these assets by investing in key capabilities and tools. So, for example, we're making technology investments in Enterprise customer relationship management, the services platform and knowledge management tools. We're investing in our supply chain to build for volume, choice, speed and efficiencies that help us offset the normal volume-based increases in expense. For example, during the quarter, we opened a new distribution center in Compton, California, in time for the busy holiday season. As we've begun work on some of these investments, this is resulting in higher capital and operating expenses this year, and this is going to be a multiyear journey, which is why we are committed to creating efficiencies to help fund investments and offset ongoing pressures in the business. After reducing costs by $1.4 billion in the past five years, our current target, established in Q2 of this year, is $600 million in additional annualized cost reductions and gross profit optimization to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. During the quarter, we achieved $50 million towards our new goal to a total thus far of $100 million. So in summary, we delivered strong top and bottom line results in the third quarter despite the pressure from the later iconic phone launch and the multiple natural disasters. We've also made significant progress against our Best Buy 2020 strategy to position us well for long-term value creation. Additionally, we returned approximately $1.5 billion in cash to our shareholders so far this year through both dividends and stock buyback. We are pleased to announce that we're planning to spend approximately $2 billion on share repurchases this fiscal year, ahead of our original expectation of $1.5 billion. With all of this momentum as backdrop, we believe we are well-positioned for a successful holiday season and are, therefore, raising our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and for the year. So, again, I'd like to thank all of our associates for their work this last quarter and for, of course, what they will do this holiday season. You all are amazing. And now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry, for more details on our Q3 performance and our Q4 guidance. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you, Hubert. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On revenue of $9.32 billion, we delivered diluted earnings per share of $0.78, both of which were within our guidance range. As Hubert discussed, we saw strong top line growth with positive comps across almost all of our product categories. However, the lower than expected mobile phone revenue caused by the later phone launch, estimated to be more than $100 million, was material enough to pull our comparable sales below our comparable sales guidance range. In addition, as Hubert mentioned, we estimate that natural disasters had a 15 basis point to 20 basis point impact on our Enterprise comparable sales and a $0.03 negative impact on our earnings per share. Like many other companies, we made decisions to support our employees, our customers and our communities, including organizing the delivery of much needed supplies to our associates in Puerto Rico, where we have three stores and a distribution center, within a few days of the devastation. Many of these decisions came at a cost, but they were definitely the right thing to do. Slightly offsetting these pressures are lower than expected Q3 tax rate provided a $0.02 benefit. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 4.2% to $9.3 billion. Enterprise diluted earnings per share increased $0.18 or 30% to $0.78. This increase was primarily driven by the flow-through of higher Domestic revenue, a $0.07 per share benefit driven by a lower effective income tax rate and a $0.04 per share benefit from the net share count change. These increases were partially offset by higher Domestic SG&A from expected increases in growth investments and higher variable costs due to increased revenue. Additionally, we had $25 million or $0.05 per share of net negative impact from lapping the Q3 fiscal 2017 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 3.6% to $8.5 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 4.5%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 10 large-format and 44 Best Buy Mobile stores closed during the past year. From a merchandising perspective, we saw positive comps across almost all of our product categories with the largest drivers being appliances, computing and smart home. As it relates to the home theater category, the industry was down for the third straight quarter, but our Q3 sales were up slightly on a year-over-year basis, resulting in another quarter of material share gains in this category. As Hubert mentioned, mobile phone revenue was impacted by the timing of launches. Even though we saw $100 million of pressure, revenue in the mobile category was up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Domestic online revenue of $1.1 billion increased 22.3% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher conversion rates and higher average order value. International revenue of $829 million increased 10.1%. This increase was primarily driven by approximately 530 basis points of positive foreign currency impact and comparable sales growth of 3.8% due to growth in both Canada and Mexico. Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise gross profit rate decreased 10 basis points to 24.5%. The Domestic gross profit rate was flat versus last year at 24.7%. Improved margin rates across multiple categories, particularly in computing and smart home, were offset by, one, margin pressure in the appliances categories; and two, an approximately 25 basis point negative impact from lapping the $25 million Q3 fiscal 2017 periodic profit-sharing benefit from our service plan portfolio. The International gross profit rate decreased 210 basis points to 22.2%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to lower sales in the higher margin services categories, mainly driven by the launch of Canada's total tech support offer, a long-term recurring revenue model. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise SG&A was $1.93 billion or 20.7% of revenue, which increased $42 million on a dollar basis, but represented a 40 basis point rate decline. Domestic SG&A was $1.75 billion or 20.6% of revenue, an increase of $31 million. This increase was primarily due to expected increases in growth investments, higher advertising expenses and higher variable costs due to the increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by the flow-through of cost reductions. The 40 basis point rate decrease was driven by sales leverage. International SG&A was $181 million or 21.8% of revenue, an increase of $11 million. This increase was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. The 80 basis point rate decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the third quarter in line with our expectations. On the balance sheet, our inventory and payables were up 5% and 6% year-over-year, respectively, due to our strategic decision to bring in more inventory early, ahead of the holiday quarter. As it relates to capital expenditures, we are now expecting to spend approximately $750 million to $800 million in fiscal 2018 as we have chosen to accelerate certain strategic investments in our e-commerce and supply chain functions. This is versus our previous expectation of approximately $700 million. I would now like to talk about our full year fiscal 2018 guidance which, as a reminder, has 53 weeks versus 52 weeks last year. We are raising our revenue growth outlook to approximately 4% to 4.8% versus our previous outlook of approximately 4%. And we are raising our non-GAAP operating income growth outlook to 7% to 9.5% versus our previous outlook of 4% to 9%. As a result, we are raising our Q4 outlook versus what was implied in the annual expectations provided on our last earnings call. Our Q4 Enterprise revenue guidance is $14.2 billion to $14.5 billion, with comparable sales growth of 1% to 3%. On a segment basis, we are expecting Domestic comparable sales growth of 1% to 3% and International comparable sales growth of flat to 3%. Our Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations guidance is $1.89 to $1.99. Our Q4 EPS guidance assumes a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 36% to 36.5%, which is materially higher than last year's 30.2%, which benefited from a number of discrete items. Finally, our guidance assumes a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 296 million shares. Our Q4 guidance reflects a number of factors. First, as we discussed on last quarter's call, we made strategic decisions to proactively make additional investments in the back half of the year to continue to drive the Best Buy 2020 strategy forward. Those additional investments are in areas such as customer choice in shipping, e-commerce and our long-term strategic vision for supply chain. Second, the outlook includes approximately $20 million or $0.04 per share of lower profit share revenue than we received last Q4. Third, our fourth quarter and full year performance is expected to drive higher incentive compensation expenses in the fourth quarter than last year's fourth quarter. This higher incentive compensation is due to both better performance this year and the fact that we are lapping a reversal of incentive compensation expense in Q4 fiscal 2017 that adjusted accruals from earlier quarters of the year. Fourth, as a reminder, the extra week in the quarter adds approximately $100 million of additional SG&A expense. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll go first today to Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Good morning, Scott. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : So wanted to get your thoughts on the TV category as we get into the fourth quarter, and then my second question would be just labor costs, not only in the fourth quarter, but as we look out to next year, we're getting a lot of noise from people that it's becoming a pretty big problem. Wanted to get your take on that? So, those two things. Thanks. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: So I'll do my best here, and then maybe Hubert can add a little bit more color. In terms of TV, I mean, the first thing that I would say is we continue to be very excited about the technology innovation in the category. And within that, we feel like we're very uniquely positioned to show off those new technologies. Obviously, according to what we can see in the NPD data, in Q3, the industry TV revenue was down about 5%, which was better than the down 10% we saw in the first part of the year. For us, we actually \u2013 we saw that business was up slightly in the quarter. Similar to Q2, units were down, but ASPs were up, and a big part of that was mixing into those bigger screen sizes and more fully featured technologies. We like that positioning heading into the fourth quarter. Obviously, it's a highly competitive quarter, but we're excited about the plan that team has put together, and we think we're really well positioned. On top of that, you asked a little bit about labor expenses. One of the investments we have actually called out over almost the last two years is continued investments in specialty labor. And we, first of all, have been a little bit better positioned than some other retailers just given that a vast majority of our labor is a little bit more highly compensated as it is already specialty labor, and then we've been making investments on top of that to ensure we remain very competitive in the marketplace. So for us, we feel like that has been a piece of the investment, and we even said at Investor Day that likely going forward will continue to be a piece of the investment thesis. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: One thing I would add on this, Scott, is that we believe one of the drivers of our very strong performance is the much reduced turnover of the labor in the stores. We think it's at the historical low, it's been materially reduced really as a result of great leadership and focus on that to make it an exciting place to work together with the compensation, but there's other actions. And of course, if you have lower turnover, people are more proficient. It's a reflection of more engagement, and I think we've got a lot of feedback on the level of energy and proficiency in the stores, and we're very excited by it, and we're committed to continuing to work on this and to make it a great place, great employee experience resulting in a great customer experience. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC : Thanks, guys. Thanks for the thoughts. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice results. Was curious just on continuation of the industry backdrop balance versus market share. Could you give a perspective maybe on how NPD trended for your categories? And then do you feel like with this pickup in same-store sales growth that it's partially a result of accelerating market share gains in the industry? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah, thank you for your question. NPD performed much better, and it's not the first quarter, but it's around plus 2%, something like that. And of course, as you all know where we compete is much broader than NPD. We think appliances is performing well, but mobile, not maybe so strong this quarter. So there's a lot of \u2013 but in general, what we're seeing is technology innovation driving demand. And we spent quite a bit of time during Investor Day sharing our enthusiasm for the fact that this is an opportunity rich environment. When we look ahead, the pace of innovation, how meaningful it is and of course, the help that customers need, that creates a rich environment for us. In the quarter, to your question, we continue to gain market share. The pace of market share gain is relatively steady, steady as you go. And so the strong performance in the quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, is really the combination of technology innovation and the fact that our strategy is continuing to resonate. And we like that combo because it's \u2013 and hopefully, you see it as a great company in a great neighborhood. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: That's great. And maybe a quick follow-up, Hubert. There was a nice pickup in the appliance category this quarter with an acceleration. Could you provide a little bit of color on what drove that? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. We think that \u2013 I mean, the housing recovery by all measures is still young and still very far from the peaks we have seen a few years ago. So that's helpful, and we're continuing to gain share in this category. The fact that, of course, some competitors have suffered is another factor, but I would highlight, as far as what we can control, the continued investment in the customer experience. Our teams, rightfully so, are very proud of the fact that we were awarded the best performance by J. D. Power and Associates from a customer experience standpoint across all of their seven criteria. We're continuing to invest there. We think we continue to have many opportunities. So in general, strong category, strong focus on customer experience, and we think that this is an opportunity that's rich with opportunities for us. So excited about that. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Thank you very much. Good luck with the holiday season. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the Q4 outlook. So you're guiding to comps in the 2% range at the midpoint. Can you just remind us some of the things that were lapping from last year, including the Note7? You had some product supply issues. If we assume that you get some of that back or maybe even a lot of it back, and then you have this $100 million shift from Q3 to Q4, it would basically imply that the rest of the business would be down slightly in the fourth quarter. Obviously, it's been trending much better than that. So just wondering is that math, right? Is there reason for that other than just conservatism and that a lot of the holiday is still ahead of us? Thanks. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Seth, as per usual, you are very good with math. You're absolutely right. And that if everything performed perfectly, so as a reminder, last year we had $200 million of Note revenue we estimated on the quarter and than we said another $100 million to $200 million related to product shortages, because it's not a perfect science. We said thought that was the range. So $300 million to $400 million. And then obviously, there's the question of moving some of the volume from Q3 into Q4. Not all those things are perfectly additive because remember, where we saw some of the product shortages was in phones. And so that -you're kind of double counting there, obviously. And the underlying business, it's not that we particularly see a lot of risk. I think we're trying to be thoughtful about the puts and takes across the business. And obviously, during the holiday season and the competitive environment that you're going to see, not everything performs exactly like it does in Q2 and Q3 leading into the season. And so we do feel like we're very well-positioned. We feel like this range is thoughtful given the plans that we have in front of us, and it does incorporate all of those factors back into it. And obviously, like Hubert even said in the prepared remarks, we're always thoughtful again about availability as we head into the quarter. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: The only thing I would add, Seth, is that when we do the scorecards, we're mindful or thoughtful about share of wallet. There's only so much that customers will spend during the quarter. And if one category or one type of product do better, it's exciting, but there's secondary effects. So we're trying to be thoughtful about this, and so the 1% to 3% outlook reflects our best thinking that's what I would say. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. That's very helpful. Just follow-up question on your store comps. So if you exclude e-commerce, they've been up about 2% over the last two quarters, a pretty meaningful improvement. Can you just help us better understand the drivers of that? Are you seeing traffic actually pickup in the stores? Is that better conversion as you've improved service? Is it a change in basket? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Sure, happy to provide color. This is a great call out and a great reflection on the role that stores play in our category and of course, the great performance of our store teams across the company. I think we're seeing significant shifts in customer behaviors in terms of what they buy online and what they buy in the stores. So clearly, from a traffic standpoint, we're continuing to see traffic decline as customers tend to buy online the higher frequency, smaller items, and they tend to focus their trips to the store for more discovery, experiential discovery, interaction with our great Blue Shirts and gravitating to higher-ticket items, more complex solutions in the stores. So clearly, we're seeing increase in the basket or the average order value in the stores, also higher conversion rates. In fact, based on the higher proficiency and great engagement of our store associates, but also the fact that customers have done more research before they go to the stores. So you see a significant shift in the performance. But in totality, we're very excited about how we can help customers online and in how we can do great things for customers in the stores. And then looking ahead, I think we're going to continue to \u2013 you had felt our excitement about the in-home channel and I had some comments about how the initial response to our In-Home Advisor program is very, very positive. So lots of excitement in our ability to help customers online, in the stores and in their home is, in fact, a unique competitive advantage. And we're happy with how it's resonating with customers. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, great. Thanks very much and good luck for the holiday. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you Seth. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Thank you very much. I'll add my congratulations as well. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : First question relates to services. Obviously, it's a major initiative for you guys going forward. But if you look at the performance in this quarter, the comp performance within that category was the lowest of any category on what is the lowest base. I was wondering, and I understand it's early in the program, but where are you in terms of growing the services business compared to your early expectations that you laid out? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Alan. What we report in the comps in services is compared to what we're looking at for the future, a relatively narrow view of services. To a very large extent, it's the commission on the warranties as well as some of the tech support services from the Geek Squad. As you look at the overall strategy Best Buy 2020, there's many service-oriented components of the strategy that are actually not reflected in that number and will not impact that particular line. In-Home Advisor, as a great example, is a free consultation in the customer's home. So no revenue from the consultation, and of course, it triggers these enhanced revenues that are largely product and some services. So it's a service-oriented approach. Similarly, the more we're moving to managed services such as Best Buy Smart Home powered by Vivint, that's not today in that line either. So the service \u2013 and looking ahead, we may \u2013 we're going to think about how to best keep everyone on that journey so that we have some meaningful indicators. We're going to take our time to think about this. But \u2013 so hopefully, I'm clear in the fact that the service line is a narrow view of what is an overall service-oriented, customer-oriented strategy. Now on the performance in the quarter of that line, our business today in services is largely an attached business related to extended warranties and some installation services. The number is broadly in line with the comps, the aggregate comps, as it's an attached business. So not surprising that in the short term, there's no material change. Corie, anything I would have missed on that? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: No, I think you hit it. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Thank you, Hubert. I appreciate that explanation. The second question has to do with mobility and in particular, obviously, the iPhone launch. Can you maybe talk about your allocations of the new iPhones compared to past allocations? And historically, what type of lift to traffic in the stores has a new launch of an iPhone given you? Thank you very much. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for your question, Alan. I am very excited about a number of things. One is how our teams have improved the customer experience, in particular around launches, and it's a good \u2013 one thing is the allocations. I won't give you specific numbers about a specific product, but let me just say, in general, we have great relationship with the key handset vendors, and we work very closely with them. But in terms of what we control, the work we've done online, in particular, to facilitate the pre-order process is very, very strong and then the ability to continue to take orders even when the delivery lead times extent, we've worked with the key vendors on making it easier to continue to take pre-orders for out times. We have described on the call we've improved all of this, both online and then in the store. So really great performance there, making it easy to do most of the work online and then making it easier to purchase in the stores. The phone category is a very exciting category. We're focused on it. Whenever there is a great iconic launch, it creates excitement. In partnership with the handset vendors, we've created great experiences in the stores. So I think these are positive, and you saw that, in fact, the fact that this iconic phone launched in our fourth quarter had a material impact. So that gives you an indication of the impact in this category. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Alan, to your specific question about the traffic. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Yes. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Like with any launch that we see, whether it's sometimes it's gaming, sometimes it's mobile, we absolutely across our channels, I think that's what important, both online and in the stores, we absolutely can see some more peaky traffic. I think what's important to note, though, is reinforcing what Hubert said overarchingly our traffic patterns when you broaden it across a quarter haven't looked that much materially different. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC : Thank you both and best of luck for the holiday season. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you Alan. Operator : We'll go next to Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. I wanted to focus on the long-term initiatives, the in-home services and those other initiatives. So in your long-term plan, you have about $2 billion in incremental sales roughly. Can you break down how much of that is coming from these services and initiatives and how much from product, please? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Good morning. So we \u2013 and we said it at Investor Day, too. At this point, we're not breaking down specifically the long range plans from each of the initiatives. Part of that's simply being that we have many of them still very much in test mode. If you think about what we're doing in total tech support as an example, you're in 200 stores at this point and testing three different models to that plan. So it's difficult to for me to tell you on the longer tail where do we think that goes. What I would reinforce is in the places where we're starting to roll things out like In-Home Advisor, Hubert started to hit on the fact that we're excited about what we're seeing there. And in fact, we already started to increase the number of advisers we have slightly based on the demands that we're seeing. And so our hypothesis definitely was that that $2 billion would need to be supported by some of these initiatives and a combination of them likely, but we're really early in that process. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. Qualitatively \u2013 and again as soon as we can, we'll try to provide more color. But qualitatively, the direction of Best Buy 2020 is of course around growth, and it's around deeper, meaningful, stickier customer relationships and over time, building more recurring revenue streams. This is going to be a journey because you have to recognize that Best Buy is a relatively big company. So in order for these numbers to become meaningful, it's going to take time. But the direction is very exciting, and for me seeing how these new approaches resonate with customers is very encouraging. So sorry, we cannot be more precise. But hopefully, you feel the direction this is heading. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yes. And if I could follow up on that, you are adding 35 more in-home advisers. Can you talk about what are you seeing that's causing you to add that? Is it certain markets? Is there any way to break down like are certain markets working better than others? Or is it the ones that have been in place longer, they're starting to need some help? Just a little bit of color on the successes that are causing you to add those people. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Sure. So we're adding \u2013 we're moving from 300 to 375. So that's 75 additional. So it's a meaningful. It's more than 20% higher that initially planned, and we'll probably continue to add next year. So I think all of you could actually test this. We underestimated demand across the country, and so the lead time if you were to try to get an In-Home Advisor now, we wouldn't be into your home this afternoon. It would be several days. We're trying to work the lead times down. I think we're probably out a week, something like this at this point, and so we were a bit \"overwhelmed\" by the initial demand. And this is a case where we'll try to pace ourselves because these are highly skilled professionals. And if you rush it, if you grow too quickly then you run the risk of deteriorating quality. So while we are pleased to be adding 75 by the beginning of next year, we don't want to go overboard, so it's going to be a fine balance, but the quick answer to your question, we underestimated the demand and the days out were a bit too high, frankly. Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the color. I appreciate that. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about what you're seeing on the connected home side in terms of where are we on that adoption curve? You started to see strong results in that category about a year ago. So are we stacking comps higher in that category? And how long do you think the tail is in terms of the consumers adoption of Alexa and the In-Home Advisor, the Google platform? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yes, Google Home. I think we're still early days. This is a significant wave, and we'll be able to measure it based on the number of devices that people have in their homes that are connected, and it's not just the voice assistance. It's all of the devices that are connected, and there was actually a survey of my home. I'll share an anecdote with you. I have 90 connected devices in my home. Now that's a bit extreme compared to the average American home, but we're in the teens probably nationwide. And so we certainly anticipate, I referenced it in my prepared remarks that during this holiday this is going to be the voice assistance in particular, but smart home more generally speaking are going to be in high demand. We think it's going to continue because what we're seeing is once people have bought, let's say, a smart camera or a smart lock, a smart device, they'll tend to then continue to add. So this is a very exciting space and we think it's still early, frankly. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Sure. I guess, just following up on that, so from the actual voice assistant, is that sort of the primary driver of growth at this point? And any sort of differentiation in terms of the adoption of those specific devices versus the cameras and the locks and thermostats and so forth? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: One of the things that's been most exciting about smart home and that supports much of what Hubert said, is that within the category, depending on the quarter, we're actually seeing different aspects of the category grow. Sometimes it's been monitoring that many people are interested in, in the cameras. Definitely, voice consistently has been a big part of the growth story, but we're seeing different pieces of that within kind of the sub-categories within that, all growing at different points. So the nice part is we definitely feel like heading into holiday voice assist continues to be a very big driver both just of curiosity but also of purchases. But the good part is that surrounding that, we're also seeing the other parts of smart home grow nicely within the category. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: And this whole smart home trend, of course, plays, and I'll state the obvious, plays really well to our strengths, all right? Because we are a player with online store and in-home capabilities, the ability to help customers across a wide range of devices and brands. We're really well positioned from the discovery stage then to the implementation and support stage. So a big part of Best Buy 2020 is about winning the home. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Understood, and then the follow-up question is the International gross margin took a pretty big hit. Is that how you rolled out the total tech services? Is that something we should think about in terms of the rollout in the U.S.? Thanks very much. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: That's a great question. So I would not, at this point, correlate the two, because like I said, in the U.S., you're at 200 stores, but three different models that we're testing, and we're doing that so that when we're ready we can come to you with a very fulsome point of view about what we think the implications are. I mean, that being said, obviously, moving to a model that looks more like support over time where you have ratable payments over time looks quite different than what Hubert talked about earlier, which is attaching a warranty to the business on the front side. And so we've rolled out well, and the customers are adopting the product, and they're enjoying their interactions with the product in Canada. It's more a question of as you provide the support model over time, and it will look great as we get into the over time part of it. It's just that the first part is you're rolling it out, and you incur some of those expenses upfront, but you get the revenue tail over time, it causes a little bit of a different financial model in the near term, but I would not correlate that yet to the U.S. because we're very early in determining what it is that we want to do here. And once we know that, I promise you we'll be quite clear on what we think the implications are. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: And what I would add is a big difference between Canada and the U.S. is that in Canada, the only version we're offering is a monthly subscription. So of course, very different than if you sell an annual subscription. In some markets in the U.S., we have monthly, but we also have annual. So I really want to reinforce the fact that what Corie said that don't extrapolate to the U.S. at this point. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Have a great holiday. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. With everything being pulled forward and holiday now really starting at the beginning of November, I wondered if you could comment at all on November in terms of what you're seeing so far from the competitive environment? And is there anything markedly different than you anticipated? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Good morning, Kate, and thank you for the question. Every holiday changes slightly, but every holiday is massively promotional. I think you're right in that, definitely, especially if you look at the trends over the last 5, 10 years, you can see the holiday pulling earlier and earlier, and you can see much bigger peaks on those large promotional periods like Thanksgiving week or like Christmas week. And so that's changing kind of the composition of how holiday builds. I wouldn't say there's anything that I see out there, and I think the team would support this, that we'd say is massively more promotional or massively different year-over-year. It's more how the holidays are flowing, continues to evolve over time. Again, not something unexpected. We even talked about bringing in some of our inventory a little earlier so we could support some of these earlier sales. And so it's not unexpected, but it's definitely kind of changing the composition of the holiday. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. And one conclusion, Kate, I've drawn from being here for the last several years is that nothing is over until the fat lady sings, meaning that \u2013 that's an opera reference, right, okay? No, seriously. You have to wait until the end of holiday to see what the results are because the timing varies significantly, including this year, if you remember last year there was a presidential election. And the consumer was distracted for a few days, so clearly, this year, we're seeing a different pattern. But no conclusion can be drawn until the end of that singing that I was referencing. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's great. Thank you. And can you just remind us with regards to how the fulfillment to the customers is changing this year versus last? I think you had mentioned that there is a number of cities where you're going to have same-day shipping to customers, and can you just tell us what is incremental this year versus last year? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: In terms of what we're offering in terms of shipping options? Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: So that like last year, Kate, we're offering free shipping with no minimum. So that's not a change. The change is the same-day delivery in 40 cities. That is not free. The charge varies a little bit. I think it's going to be $5.99, I believe the last time I ordered something for same-day delivery, that's what I paid. So that's \u2013 same-day delivery in 40 cities is really the new factor. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: I think in general, and we talk about some of the supply chain expensing included into the Q4 guide. In general, we're trying to build for speed and flexibility. So it's same day, it's next day, it's two-day, it's weekend, it's cut-off times, it's all those things that the team is continuing to invest in so that whenever customers want it, they have the flexibility to get it in the timeframe that matters to them. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Good morning. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hubert, I'd like to actually stay with the In-Home Advisor just for a second. You're hiring 75 more in-home advisers because the demand was better than you thought. I know you alluded to potentially marketing the program maybe this holiday season at some point at your Investor Day. Can you talk about how that went? I know you have a commercial out there, but did you pull back on marketing spend, because there's just been so much demand and you didn't want to maybe frustrate your consumer? Or are your marketing plans continuing exactly how you expected? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Matt. The plans are continuing as expected. We asked ourselves the question, the marketing team and the store team seeing the early results, reviewed things and the weight of the marketing on in-home advisers is actually relatively light. And so there was no anxiety around that. Our focus is more on operationally doing a great job, we're trying to do a great job of being responsive to customers and reducing these lead time, and so on and so forth. So that's been the approach. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then Corie, just a housekeeping question. You extended the share repurchase to $2 billion this year. Can you update us on your thoughts on the level of cash balance that you would prefer to keep on your balance sheet going forward? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. A great question. And so first, I just want to make sure that I'm clear that we're not updating the $3 billion of repurchase that we set at the beginning of the year over the two years. We still are planning to achieve that amount. That being said, we've never come out and said exactly what we believe the ending cash balance is that we're seeking, but we're very clear that we're using our new capital allocation strategy to make sure that we continue to work that balance down in a really thoughtful way. We've always said and as a reminder, first, we want to reinvest in the business where we feel like we have the right investments and the right return. And so we continue to do that. But at the same point, we're obviously pacing in some of this repurchase and the dividend so that we make sure we return cash wherever possible. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: If I could follow-up on that, just theoretically, as your business model shifts more towards service or reoccurring revenue stream that Hubert outlined at the Investor Day, would that imply that you could maintain a lower cash balance than historically on the balance sheet? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think there's a lot of things actually that work into implying that you likely can have a lower cash balance certainly than we do today. One is just the overall strength of the business and the performance, and that's what Hubert alluded to, these really strong partnerships with our vendors. Those are some of the most important things. And then obviously, over time, as you continue to beef up that stability in your business, that is absolutely what gives you more confidence to go ahead and work that cash balance down. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: I do want to reiterate that the development of recurring revenue stream is something that's going to take time. So I don't want you to assume that already next year this could be a very material part of our business. It's going to take time. It's a very meaningful transformation, but it's going to take time. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for the color. Looking forward to that though Hubert. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Great. Same here. Thank you. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : We'll go next to Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Good quarter, guys. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: A quick question on the earlier one, conservatism maybe on the fourth quarter outlook. Any reason to think that $1,000, as people are veering towards the X that price point could eat into other sales? And then can you just remind me, if I'm buying out the phone versus taking an installment plan, is the revenue any different to you? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: So let me start with kind of you referenced really what the share of wallet question, and Hubert even hit on this, which is it is difficult when you have $1,000 price point phone, even a $800, a $500 price point phone. And obviously, when you're thinking about how much of your expendable income you're going to spend on CE, we are quite thoughtful about that share of wallet question, particularly over the holidays when people often go in with a budget and are trying to think about how to stretch that budget as far as they can. And so that's absolutely part of what we are thoughtful about when it comes to Q4. Then obviously, over the last two years, three years, four years, the Q4 has not played like the earlier quarters of the year. And so we're trying to take some of that knowledge we've gained into account as we think about where we believe the fourth quarter is going to go. In terms of the revenue profile, from a revenue perspective, in whatever way we sell the phone, the revenue profile is similar. The piece that looks different is depending on whether or not there's a plan attached to that and what the consumer decides to purchase alongside the hardware. That's what changes the profile, but the revenue profile is the same no matter what. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then thinking past fourth quarter and into next year, you're going to have some tough product compares next year. Do you expect the momentum generally to continue? And then will the service offering be meaningful enough next year to enable the business to continue comping, I don't know, at these current rates, but in healthy low-single digit rates? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yes, obviously, we're not, Simeon, providing guidance for next year today. This year is going to turn out, I mean, so far this year, the growth rate have been very significant. And based on our outlook, would have been a very strong year. We provided two months ago a three-year outlook in terms of the revenue with implied revenue growth rates on a compounded basis that are below the number that we have so far this year. So we're not providing guidance for next year. But yes, carrying over these exact numbers for next year, I would not encourage you to do this at this point in time. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Well, with this I want to conclude our call and really thank you for your continued work on our behalf, following us and sharing our excitement about where we are and where we are going. Sometimes when you look at these numbers, you have to go back a few years ago and thinking about Best Buy with the kind of comps and EPS growth we're reporting today, 4.4% comps and 30% EPS growth on top of a 51% EPS growth last year, you have to almost pinch yourself thinking about where we are compared to where we were five years ago, so very excited, which gives me the opportunity to thank again all of our associates. They are just terrific, amazing, dedicated, big heart, big soul, and great skills. And then finally, we look forward to seeing you in the stores. If you want to get that Sharp, 50-inch, 4K TV at $179.99, I would encourage you to be early in the stores on Thanksgiving at 5 :00 because can you imagine that? 4K TV, $179.99, 50-inch, how cool is that? In any event, we'll see you in stores or online, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This does conclude our call for today. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to Best Buy's Q4 Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 :00 a.m. Eastern Time today. I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mollie O'Brien - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Good morning, and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO and Corie Barry, our CFO. This morning's conference call must be considered in conjunction with the earnings press release we issued this morning. Today's release and conference call both contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain business events. These non-GAAP financial measures are provided to facilitate meaningful year-over-year comparisons, but should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures for the period. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are going to useful can be found in this morning's earning release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com. Today's earnings release and conference call also include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address the financial condition, results of operations, business initiatives, growth plans, operational investments and prospects of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and SEC filings for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. As a reminder, the fourth quarter we are reporting today includes 14 weeks compared to last year's 13-week quarter. We estimate the extra week was approximately $760 million in revenue and approximately $0.20 of non-GAAP diluted EPS. The extra week is excluded from our comparable sales calculations. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and of our fiscal 2018 annual performance, and then provide a preview of our fiscal 2019 priorities as we continue to implement Best Buy 2020 : Building The New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. So, today we are reporting a fourth quarter Enterprise comparable sales growth of 9% and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.42, which is up 25% compared to last year. These are very strong and better-than-expected results. The strong comps are the results of a combination of factors. First, strong execution of our strategy combined with better product availability; second, a continued healthy consumer confidence and positive macro conditions; third, strength in the gaming category; and fourth, a favorable competitive environment, as we benefited from the exit or decline of certain competitors. Let me elaborate. Customers are responding very positively to our Best Buy 2020 strategy. We are gaining market share and continuing to improve our Net Promoter Scores across the company in a material fashion. Specifically, during the quarter, we continued to demonstrate our ability to partner with vendors to commercialize new technology across a broad spectrum of products. This strength was supported by an effective 30-day promotional plan that customers found compelling. In parallel to this, a key driver of our success is the mobilization of the company, particularly the associates on the front line, who are on a mission to enrich peoples' lives through technology. This comes to life in a very powerful way in our stores where I am impressed by the level of engagement and proficiency of our associates, their desire and ability to truly connect with customers, understand what they're trying to accomplish and then find a solution that will satisfy their needs. We're also making progress online where we have continued to streamline the buying process, enabled faster and more efficient delivery, and further enhanced the buy online, pick up in store experience for our customers. Online comparable sales increased 18% in the fourth quarter and were 20% of our total domestic sales. As I mentioned earlier, product availability was much better this year and was a factor in driving our strong growth. You may recall that last year, we had both product recalls and product availability constraints across multiple vendors and categories. This year, product availability was much better across the industry. And additionally, we deliberately invested in having more product in stock and available for customers. From a profitability standpoint, we grew operating income dollars by 10% on revenue growth of 14%, which led to a 20-basis point decline in the operating income rate. Let me break this down for you by focusing on the Domestic segment, which makes over 90% of the Enterprise. So, in the Domestic segment, we delivered a flat gross profit rate with SG&A expenses, while SG&A expenses grew slightly more than the revenue growth rate. This is due first to the increase in incentive compensation expenses for more than 85,000 of our store and corporate employees as a result of the very strong performance this year; and second, to the investment we have made in the business, partially offset by efficiencies and cost savings. At the EPS level, our Q4 non-GAAP EPS grew by 25%. This result was positively impacted by a lower tax rate due to both tax reform and other discrete items. Turning to our full year results, our performance in fiscal 2018 was strong. We grew our comparable sales 5.6%, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 20 basis points, and increased our non-GAAP EPS by 26%, which are a materially better result than what we expected when we began the year. We returned $2.4 billion to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. We continued to improve our Net Promoter Scores and drive market share gains, proof that our strategy is resonating with customers. We reduced store employee turnover and increased overall employee engagement. And we made significant progress against key Best Buy 2020 initiatives. For example, last September, we launched our new In-Home Advisor program nationally and significantly expanded our Total Tech Support pilot. We continued to upgrade the experience in the stores and online, and we began investing in the transformation of our supply chain and other key systems and capabilities necessary to enable our strategy. And so, I want to enthusiastically thank our associates for their great work in delivering these results. The level of energy and dedication to serving customers that I see across the company is very inspiring. Now looking ahead, our focus is on the continued implementation of our Best Buy 2020 strategy. We continue to believe we have a material opportunity ahead of us to grow the company. We also know there continues to be real pressures from areas like wages, supply chain and channel shift. In that context, our mindset has not changed. We are playing to win and, of course, the strategy we outlined in September has not changed. The purpose of our Best Buy 2020 strategy is to enrich lives through technology. As we outlined last September, we plan to fulfill our purpose and grow the company by expanding what we sell and evolving how we sell and building the key enablers that are needed, while continuing to take cost out. Let me highlight a few of our fiscal 2019 priorities along these lines. First, in fiscal 2019, we will continue to ramp up our In-Home Advisor program as we add advisors and improve the related tools and systems that help them do their jobs. Second, we are planning a nationwide launch of our Total Tech Support program this coming spring. As a reminder, Total Tech Support is a new Geek Squad offering we began testing last year. We provide support for all of the customers' technology, no matter where and when they bought it. We believe that customer support needs are often not limited to a specific product. The need now is to have all of their technology work together. This support is available to customers 24/7 online, in-store and on the phone. The price of this service is $199 per year and includes discounts on other services like in-home services and extended warranty programs. Third, we will continue to develop the proficiency of our associates and their ability to deeply understand and address customer needs. Fourth, we will continue to streamline the online buying process for our customers. Online shoppers need to be able to seamlessly navigate our site and quickly and intelligently narrow their product or service selection. For example, we will be further enhancing the search functionality with natural language capability, so customers can find what they need by simply typing in phrases like best laptop for students, quiet dishwasher or sturdy camera. Fifth, from the multi-channel standpoint, building on our success with in-store pickup, we continue to test new and convenient ways for customers to get their orders. For example, we are piloting a new feature on our mobile app that allows customers to tell us when they are on their way to pick up their large TV or major appliance, so we can have it ready for them when they arrive and they won't have to wait at the store pickup counter for an associate to bring the product from the backroom. And we are also testing lockers and curbside pickup solutions. In addition, we will continue to explore and invest in a range of digital solutions such as voice assistance across a variety of customer touch points as well as personalization initiatives. Now to successfully expand what we sell and evolve how we sell, we are investing in a range of enablers as we described in September across technology, stores, supply chain, new business initiatives and cost take-out projects. For example, we are continuing the technology investments we began last year in Enterprise customer relationship management and knowledge management tools, expanding the usage from our In-Home Advisors to associates across our services organization and our call centers. This will help us build a more seamless, more effective experience for our customers and paves the way towards a more relationship-based approach to the customer experience we offer. We're also building out a new services platform to help power our Total Tech Support offering and provide the ability for customers to get easy and quick access to our Geek Squad tech experts, including a new app with video chat capability. In stores, we are building a number of digital tools that are designed to relieve customer pain points like streamlining the checkout for long, complex customer orders and significantly reducing processing times and, therefore, customer wait times for mobile phone transactions. We will also continue to invest in specialty labor in areas such as appliances, In-Home Advisor and smart home. As it relates to our supply chain, we will continue the long-term strategic investments we started last year that are designed to expand our bandwidth for growth and speed. Of course, our fiscal 2019 priorities also include initiatives that increase productivity to offset pressures and fund investments. Our current productivity target established in Q2 of fiscal 2018 is $600 million in additional annualized cost reductions and gross profit optimization to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. During the fourth quarter, we achieved approximately $135 million towards our new goal for a total thus far of $235 million. A significant portion of the $135 million flowed through the income statement in the fourth quarter with the largest portion being gross profit optimization, driven primarily by a material decrease in price erosion in our stores. This was achieved by making improvements to processes and systems that resulted in fewer price overrides in the stores, more accurate price matching and better return on clearance pricing. Now as a part of our strategy to continuously optimize our business, yesterday we announced our intent to close our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. effective May 31. Let me say a few words about this. First, we are very grateful for the work our stand-alone stores associates have done over the last several years, and we will work hard to retain the maximum number of these employees as we value their expertise and as we have a range of opportunities for them within the company. Why are we closing these stores? We began opening these stores more than a decade ago before the iPhone was even launched. Back then the mobile phone business was in a period of rapid growth and margins were high. Fast forward to 2018 and the mobile phone business has matured, margins have compressed and the cost of operations in our stand-alone stores is higher than in our big-box stores. We're committed to and remain excited about the mobile phone category. We simply believe that it makes more sense for us to grow this category in our big-box stores and online. We are excited by the superior customer experience we're building there. The Mobile 2020 work we began last year makes it easier for a customer to research and compare plans and then purchase and set up a phone. In support of this goal, hundreds of our big-box stores now include dedicated vendor experiences associated with carriers and manufacturers like Apple, AT&T, Samsung, Sprint and Verizon and we're adding more of these this year. So, in summary, we are operating in an opportunity rich environment driven by innovation and customer needs for help. We are the market share leader with unique opportunities to expand what we sell and evolve how we sell and build the companies that customers love. As we head into fiscal 2019, we are all highly motivated to continue to propel the company forward. Corie will provide a more detailed outlook, but at a high level, we're expecting comparable sales to be flat to up 2%, which is on top of the 5.6% we delivered in fiscal 2018; an operating income rate of approximately 4.5%, which is flat to last year on a comparable 52-week basis; and non-GAAP EPS of $4.80 to $5, an increase of 9% to 13% or an increase of 14% to 18% compared to last year on a comparable 52-week basis. As it relates to our target for fiscal 2021, while it would be premature to update our revenue and operating income targets for that year, we are increasing our EPS target for fiscal 2021 from the $4.35 to $5.00 range we provided in September to a $5.50 to $5.75 range as a result of tax reform. And now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry, for more details on our Q4 performance and our fiscal 2019 guidance. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you, Hubert. Good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year and versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter, I would like to provide additional context on our GAAP versus non-GAAP results. Enterprise GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.23 per share versus non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42. The non-GAAP number excludes the following items related to tax reform. One, a one-time repatriation tax on the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries; two, revaluation of our net deferred tax asset at the lower corporate statutory rate; three, the payment of appreciation bonuses primarily to our hourly store associates; and four, a charitable donation to the Best Buy Foundation. In addition, we also incurred the initial restructuring charges associated with our intent to close our remaining U.S. Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores. Versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter, Enterprise revenue of $15.4 billion exceeded our expectations and was driven by higher-than-expected revenue in both our Domestic and International segments and nearly all product categories. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.42 also exceeded our expectations due to the lower non-GAAP tax rate and the flow-through of the higher revenue. A lower-than-expected tax rate provided a $0.29 per share benefit versus our expectations and was mainly the result of the resolution of the three tax items and a lower tax rate for the month of January due to tax reform changes. While the gross profit rate and non-GAAP SG&A rate were in line with our original expectations, we did not gain incremental SG&A leverage with the higher sales due primarily to the incentive compensation for both our corporate and field employees exceeding expectations. I will provide additional details on this later in my remarks. I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 14% to $15.4 billion, which included approximately $760 million from the extra week. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased $0.49 or 25% to $2.42. This increase was primarily driven by an estimated $0.20 per share benefit from the extra week, a $0.15 per share benefit from the net share count change on a 52-week basis, a $0.10 per share benefit driven by the lower tax rate and the flow-through of the higher revenue, which was largely offset by the higher incentive compensation and the negative impact of approximately $0.03 per share from a lower periodic profit sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio versus last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 13.4% to $14 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 9% and approximately $715 million of revenue from the extra week. These gains were partially offset by the loss of revenue from 18 large-format stores closed during the past year. From a merchandising perspective, we generated comparable sales growth across most of our categories, with the largest drivers being mobile phones, gaming, appliances, smart homes, wearables and home theater. As it relates to mobile phones, the category was positively impacted by sales of the Samsung Note, which we were not able to sell last year due to a recall. Also as we mentioned on our call last quarter, we had approximately $100 million shift from Q3 into Q4 due to the later launch of the iPhone X. Domestic online revenue of $2.8 billion was 20% of Domestic revenue and increased 17.9% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher conversion rates and higher average order values. International revenue of $1.4 billion increased 20.3%. This increase was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 9.9% due to growth in both Canada and Mexico, approximately 580 basis points of positive foreign currency impact, and approximately $45 million of revenue from the extra week. Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise gross profit rate decreased 20 basis points to 22.3% due to a lower rate in Canada. The Domestic gross profit rate of 22.3% was flat to last year. The gross profit optimization that Hubert mentioned earlier helped offset pressure in the mobile phone category, the impact of mixing into certain lower-margin products and the approximate 15-basis point negative impact from the lower periodic profit sharing benefit. The International gross profit rate decreased 220 basis points to 22.4%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to, one, lower sales in the higher-margin services category primarily driven by the launch of Canada's total tech support offer, a long-term recurring revenue model; two, a decrease margin rate in the home theater category; and three, an approximate 15-basis point negative impact from a lower periodic profit sharing benefit. Turning to SG&A, Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $2.4 billion or 15.9% of revenue, which increased $299 million on a dollar basis and was flat from a rate perspective versus last year. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $2.2 billion or 15.8% of revenue versus $1.9 billion or 15.7% of revenue last year. The $276 million increase was primarily due to higher incentive compensation, the impact of the extra week, investments, and higher variable costs due to increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by the flow-through of cost reductions. I would like to spend a little more time on the higher incentive compensation expense due to the magnitude of the impact it had on our Q4 results. The higher expense was driven by both our retail and corporate plans, which used targeted performance metrics established at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, we started the year with an annual guidance of approximately 1.5% revenue growth and low single-digit growth in non-GAAP operating income, both of which we significantly exceeded. Our corporate incentive expense aligns with annual performance goals and has accrued over the course of the year based on expected full year performance. In Q4 of last year, due to the lower-than-expected performance, we both reversed expenses for certain metrics that had been accrued over the course of the year and did not accrue additional expense within the quarter for certain metrics. This year, we had the reverse effect, as certain metrics exceeded our previous expectations for the full year, which had a disproportionate negative impact on the fourth quarter, even though payment amounts were related to full year performance. International non-GAAP SG&A was $223 million or 16.2% of revenue, an increase of $23 million. This increase was primarily driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the extra week. The 130-basis point rate decrease was primarily driven by sales leverage. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the fourth quarter in line with our expectations. On the balance sheet, our inventory was up 7%, our payables were down 2%, and our receivables balance was down 22%. Our owned inventory position and receivables would have been roughly flat if last year would have also included an extra week. As it relates to capital allocation, our approach has not changed. Our strategy is to fund operations and investments in growth, including potential acquisitions, and then to return excess free cash flow over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining investment-grade credit metrics. We continue to target a non-GAAP dividend payout ratio between 35% and 45%. In the context of our overall strategy, our improved performance and the savings brought about by tax reform, we have taken and plan to take the following measures that benefit employees, our community, the business and our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, for our employees, we paid one-time $1,000 bonuses to both full-time store associates and non-bonus eligible corporate employees and $500 to part-time store associates. We also made a $20 million charitable contribution to the Best Buy Foundation. Going forward, we are investing in the enablers necessary to propel our strategies. This includes both people and systems, and the related costs are reflected in our annual guidance. For our people, we will continue to invest in specialty labor and plan to invest in improvements to our employee benefit programs. In support of our systems investments, we are raising our fiscal 2019 capital expenditure plan to $850 million to $900 million from the expectations we shared at Investor Day of $750 million to $850 million. This morning, we announced that we increased our dividend 32% and increased our share buyback plans for fiscal 2019 by $500 million to $1.5 billion. I would now like to talk about our full year fiscal 2019 guidance which, as a reminder, has 52 weeks versus 53 weeks in fiscal 2018. We are expecting the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $41 billion to $42 billion; Enterprise comparable sales of flat to up 2%; Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.5%, which is flat to fiscal 2018's rate on a 52-week basis despite the investments we are accelerating as a result of tax reform; Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $4.80 to $5.00, an increase of 9% to 13%. This represents an increase of 14% to 18% when compared to fiscal 2018 on a 52-week basis. And finally, we are expecting a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%. I would like to call out a number of assumptions reflected in our annual guidance. Our investments, in particular, in specialty labor, supply chain and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $35 million of lower profit share revenue, will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies. The increased investments in supply chain as well as higher transportation costs, in particular, are expected to add approximately 25 basis points of gross profit pressure each quarter to our Domestic business. The national rollout of our Total Tech Support offering in Q2 will pressure the gross profit rate of the Domestic business. This is due in part to recognizing the revenue over the term of the membership. On a full year basis, we expect the rollout to have a negative impact of approximately 15 to 20 basis points on our Domestic gross profit rate. The Best Buy Mobile small-format store closures are estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately $225 million with flat to slightly positive impact on operating income. And finally, our guidance reflects lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our performance targets to align with our fiscal 2019 expectations. I would also like to talk specifically about our Q1 fiscal 2019 guidance. We are expecting the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $8.65 billion to $8.75 billion; comparable sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%; Domestic comparable sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%; and International comparable sales growth of flat to 3%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.68 to $0.73, an increase of 13% to 22%; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 22% to 22.5%; and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 290 million shares. Please note that our Q1 guidance reflects the following impacts. We estimate that the negative impacts from calendar shift total approximately $100 million in revenue, with the biggest driver being the timing of Super Bowl, as related sales were pulled forward into the extra week in Q4 fiscal 2018 versus Q1 fiscal 2019. As I just mentioned, increased investments in supply chain, as well as higher transportation costs are expected to add approximately 25 basis points of gross profit rate pressure. We will have approximately $8 million of lower Domestic gross profit due to lapping a legal settlement received last year. And we expect the International gross profit rate pressure we saw in Q4 to continue into the first quarter. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. And we'll go ahead with our first question from Matt Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks so much, and congratulations on a terrific print. My first question and primary question relates to gross margin. You spoke about lower store price erosion as a driver of Domestic gross margin rate. Can you talk about what that means? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Sure. Absolutely, Matt. So, when we're talking about erosion, what we're looking at, we kind of broke it up into three buckets actually when we talked about it. We talked about price overrides in the stores, more accurate price matching and better return on clearance pricing. Essentially, that is decisions that we make at the store level to move through inventory for various reasons, clearance obviously makes sense given the nature of clearance items. But above and beyond that, the things like price overrides are decisions that are often made at the store level around price matching or competitive price matching, and we built in a lot more science behind the scenes, when and how to match and how to price that clearance merchandise, so that it moves as fast as you would like it to and you garner the most value out of it as possible. So, this is an excellent example of both corporate and our field employees working together to try and build both science and then processes in the field that help build these efficiencies. And it's a lot of what we've talked about before about these being these really cross-functional efforts to try to pull cost out. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: So, it sounds like this is more about execution than about the environment. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: You've got it. That's exactly the right way to frame it up. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And just a quick follow-up on sales, to the extent that you're guiding to a much more subdued comp performance in 2018 than you posted last year, which categories do you expect to be smaller contributors or be challenged by tough compares relative to 2017? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: We've got a couple major things that are happening for sure. Remember, we benefited disproportionately this year from filling in the hole that was left by the lack of a Note device the year prior. We'll still have a little bit of that into this year, but only about a half a year of that, so there is just a hole there. Remember, we also had some of the real product storages last year in Q4 that we lapped this year. We aren't going to have that same lap next year. We had good product availability this year, which we specifically called out. And the other thing we specifically called out was gaming and, in particular, the Switch which launched, as a reminder, last year in Q1. And so now this year we're going to be lapping that full gaming cycle. And so those were big drivers of growth that just by the nature of what they were, you'd expect to decelerate a bit as we head into the next year. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks so much, Corie. Operator : And we'll go ahead with our next question from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good morning guys. Two questions. First, hopefully this is an easy one. With better hindsight, can you size the impact of the call-back on last year's product shortages? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. I think last year we had talked about in Q4 about a $400 million figure that included primarily phones, but it was also activities around appliances with the recall and in general, shortages. And so this year, we're benefiting from anniversarying this. In addition to this, we deliberately invested in better product availability, better in-stock across our channels, so as to be able to meet customer demand. And so it's really the combination of the two factors that were quite helpful. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. So, still a good gauge in terms of $400 million. And then, I guess a bigger question, Hubert, like \u2013 but before this past year, I think you guys have kind of characterized your company and positioned your company as a premium dividend payer, throws off a lot of cash, gaining share in an industry that's kind of a flat to slow growth kind of market. But you guys just put up some of the best comp growth you've had in a very long time this past year. Does that reassess how you're thinking about the longer-term growth trajectory of this business? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: So, I think what we are saying today is very consistent with what we said in September. We have an opportunity rich environment where there is increasing product innovation and the need for help on the part of the customers. And we think that we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of that and we're building all of the enablers to be able to capture these growth opportunities. So, we've provided a fiscal 2021 outlook in terms of revenue and operating income rate, where certainly compared to Renew Blue, in Best Buy 2020, we'll have more focus on growth and building a moat for the company. So, we're becoming more of a growth-oriented company for sure. We're maintaining the premium dividend payer status. Initially, in the last one or two years, we said \u2013 we see these opportunities. We said initially you're not going to believe us, give us time to be able to build that and you're finding us on the way in this direction. We're not updating today our fiscal 2021 revenue and operating income numbers because we think it's premature, it's really \u2013 we're four months after September, five months after September. We've upgraded the EPS target because of the benefit of tax reform. So, that's a material upgrade. But, yes, we're gradually evolving the status of the company with a very strong focus on playing to win, growing the company on the basis of a company that does extraordinary things for customers. I want the customers \u2013 we went from customers that didn't like us, they now like us, I'd like them to love us, and we think that it positions us well from a growth standpoint. We're not changing the capital allocation strategy of premium dividend and return of capital (36:19) today based on the results of our performance. So, that's how I would summarize it, Scot. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thanks a lot, guys. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And we'll go ahead with our next question from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Good morning, Brian. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Congratulations on a really nice quarter and year. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: I guess so my one question. Corie, thanks for all the detail on the SG&A. I just want to, so to say, probe further on the incentive compensation. The question I have there is, is there a way to break out, as we look at the results, the actual impact of the incentive compensation in the fourth quarter? And then as we look into 2018 or, I guess, even beyond, how should we think about, so to say, the leverage point in your model given the investments you're making? Or maybe said better, any \u2013 where could (37:19) upside to sales \u2013 to your sales plan actually make its way to the bottom line? Thanks. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Sure. So, I'll start with the first part of the one question. But let me take a step back here for a second on incentive comp metrics. These are about annual plans that we set at the beginning of the year. And we reminded you, at the beginning of the year, we set, essentially on a 52-week basis, flat top line, flat bottom line guidance. And we called out on Q3, we expected incentive comp to have a higher impact in Q4. And that was based on the performance we genuinely thought we could see for Q4 at that point. As it relates specifically to the fourth quarter, there were three things that happened that had a disproportionate impact on Q4. First, and I talked about it, the fourth quarter didn't come in as planned last year, as I'm sure you remember, and so we reversed out expense that we had accrued already throughout the year. Second, in the fourth quarter, many metrics came in higher than we'd been accruing for all year this year. Obviously, we outperformed in a lot of different ways. And that meant the fourth quarter expense included amounts that would have been accrued for in earlier quarters if we would have known the whole year was going to perform as well. And then three, the fourth quarter just, in and of itself, was way better than expected. And so when you stack those four things up, the impact to the fourth quarter was just north of $100 million. But to put that in perspective, year-over-year our increase in incentive comp was about $130 million for the whole year. You can see the disproportionate impacts the accrual had on this fourth quarter. That being said, I want to make sure I'm crystal clear that we're really excited to be able to sharing the performance with our associates, and that more than 85,000 people received some \u2013 or will receive some portion of this payout. So, I want to make sure that comes across very clearly. To the extent of your second point on leverage and where the leverage point is, I think Hubert said it really well. When we set up for Investor Day, we said we're going to aim for top line growth and then we are going to do what we need to do to reinvest in the business and maintain that flattish operating income rate, but we're going to pick different points to accelerate some of our initiatives or launch some of our initiatives depending on kind of how that top line flows for us. And so it's not as easy as the math of when exactly do you get leverage. It's a question of how quickly we can get legs under a multitude of the initiatives that we talked about from a strategic perspective and how can we deliver on that overall financial equation that we're driving for the growth and then the relative stability in operating income rates. Obviously, a little volatile quarter-to-quarter, but in general a progression toward flat to maybe up just a bit in that op income rate. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: And maybe if I pile on the basic belief we have. And I think it's very important from an investment thesis standpoint is that down the road, the space we are in is a space where there's going to be outsized return for the winners versus the losers. And this is a time to play to win and build \u2013 invest in our growth capabilities, build the moat so that we position ourselves for long-term success in a very significant fashion. So, I think in the short term, the return we're providing to shareholders on the basis of the growth, the EPS growth, the return of capital we're excited about, I hope you share that perspective, and we are also positioning ourselves for long-term success again with the view that there is going to be an increasing difference between winners and losers, and we know what camp we want to be in. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Got it. Very helpful. Congratulations again. Thank you. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, if we roll back the clock, a year ago you were guiding to an implied comp of around flattish. You did north of a 5.6%. What did better from a product category side from the Switch to drive that performance? Or was it just you gained much more share than you were assuming at that point? And how does that frame potential upside from a product category perspective for this year? And as part of that question, maybe you can talk about what do you think is more important for the business, product cycles or the overall health of consumer spending, because maybe some of the product cycles might fade this year, but the overall spending environment might pick up. Thank you. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you so much, Michael. I want to use this opportunity to convey a key thought. Yes, there's product cycles, and we love product innovation because we have this unique ability to commercialize new technology. What is driving the increased performance is not a particular \u2013 with the exception of gaming, which we always have ups and downs. It's not a particular product, it's in the context where consumer confidence is good. I think we estimate the overall market for technology products in calendar 2017 was flattish, so better than negative, but not overly positive. What's driving the result is, it's our strategy and our execution. Our positioning as a company that can address customer needs and truly help them achieve what they're trying to do in their life and then provide the support along the way, the quality of the execution, the increasing gap in our \u2013 and uniqueness of what we do for customers is really what we think is driving the performance. And this is also what is positioning us. From a product standpoint, yes, gaming was helpful. Equally important is, of course, in retail, you always have to look at what happened last year. So, last year, in the fourth quarter, we had the product availability issues. So, that is certainly boosting our Q4 and total year performance. And this won't happen \u2013 once you've anniversaried that, it doesn't happen again. But I want to convey that increasingly, we're trying to build this moat, and there will be new product introductions, but it's the strategic positioning that's really helpful. Now underneath this, every year the booming products will evolve. So, this year we've had gaming. I think smart home has been helpful. Home appliances has been helpful, and some of these things will fluctuate and will ride these waves. But again, it's this emphasis on the uniqueness of the strategic positioning. Corie, any details you want to add? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: The only thing that I would add is, if you went back and looked at the category drivers for each of the last four quarters, you would see that, of course, we've called out gaming and we've been very explicit. But under gaming, it has been a rotating mix of categories that we've gained share in and that are very reflective of our positioning. Computing has come up multiple times. Home theater has come up. Smart home, as we brought those products to bear, and I think that just underlines what it is Hubert was saying that it's not just things spike when there's product launches. These have been categories that have been called out for quarter after quarter after quarter of excellent performance. And I think that underlies (44:41) the feeling and data and evidence that we have that the strategy is taking hold in terms of the shopping experience. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Okay? Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : Hi. It's Dan Binder. Thank you. My question was \u2013 congratulations by the way on a great quarter. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : My question was centered around the services business, the rollout, the pressure on gross margins and maybe a starting point, could you give us a sense of the International gross margin erosion? How much of that was from the services rollout specifically? And why, when you do it in the U.S., won't it be as significant as what we've been seeing in Canada? And finally, with the impact that you did give us, can you help us understand what you think the sales benefit is? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: So, I'll start with answering your question from a customer standpoint, and then Corie will add color on a profit basis. So, what is exciting in what's happening here is the customer response to some of our initiatives. In-Home Advisor, I think, can be characterized as a service initiative, but recognizing there is no revenue attached to this. But this is a consultative approach in the home to help customers and address their needs where we really like how it's been framed. We like the customer response, and we'll gradually increase that. The benefit of this initiative is in product sales, unlocking demand and building relationships. Total Tech Support is equally exciting. It complements in a way the upfront consultative approach In-Home Advisor with the ongoing support across all of the customers' portfolio. The fact that we've decided to roll this out in the spring in the U.S. is a clear sign. Corie will go through the mechanics of some of the profitability. We see Total Tech Support, number one, as a service offering with its own P&L, but also as a part of the flywheel we're trying to build, building an end-to-end relationship with the customers, so we like the customer response on this one. From a profit standpoint, Corie? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: All right, Dan. I'll do my best to parse this apart. Let me start with International. In the International business, the gross profit compression is about half services and about half other product things that we called out on the walk. And so it's not all, to be clear, the Total Tech Support offer. I'm going to take one step back, Hubert talked about this a little bit. But remember, we rolled one version in Canada, and that is a monthly-pay version that has various attributes set up with it. We've tested a few different versions here in the U.S. in 200 stores, so a pretty wide breadth in our test. And ultimately, as we said in the prepared remarks, we're going to go with an annual plan that you pay for up front here in the U.S. So, it's a different plan, and we've seen just slightly different results here in the U.S. even than what we saw in Canada. As to Hubert's point, we like the customer demand. We like the customer experience, and so all of that is hanging. The change in the model here is that it's a recurring revenue relationship model. So, you incur more expense up front, right, at the point that someone purchases is they often get value up front, but you're going to amortize and recognize that revenue over time. And so the first year, that creates a little bit of imbalance. But what we really like about it is that as people stay on the plan over time, it becomes much more accretive into the out-years. And so to your question about revenue lift, it's not as much in year one because you have that amortization over time impact, but as you get out into the out-years, years two and three and we start to think about bringing the longer-term strategy to life, this becomes a nice accretive model over time. And it's why we want to start with what is it customers want. We hear they want support and then how do we build that model to give them that across all their devices over time. Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. Operator : We'll go ahead with our next question from David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead. David Schick, your line is open. David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi there. Can you hear me okay? Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good morning, David. David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay, great. Thanks so much for the question. I want to go back to something Hubert just said about commercializing technology. And I realize in any quarter, there's discrete items, plus or minus. But the general lift, could you characterize what's going on as more about early adopters getting very involved in 4K and more TVs and smart home and services? Or is this the beginning of everybody else? I'm not sure which would lead to longer and better growth. It might be the same, the answer, but just to understand where we are in this wave as you sort of position for that. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, David. Let me distinguish the market and then our growth. The market, in general, is driven by this overall technology innovation we're seeing. In our lives, technology is more and more pervasive. The number of items that are technology enabled in our homes keeps going up. Of course, early adopters play a role there. But the overall market as near as we can tell is really difficult to measure from a hardware standpoint. The overall market seems flattish. What is happening in driving our revenue is actually not so much that, but what we do with it. So, it's the question of how do we take advantage of this. If I take the TV home theater segment, our teams have played a key role working with the vendors on the definition and then introduction of 4K technology. And I remember there was a debate one or two years ago about at some point, will Best Buy surrender market share to the mass channel. So, I'm going to paraphrase a famous politician, we will never surrender. And what we are seeing is that because of the continued innovation and the way we are able to merchandise both online, in the stores, support customers, we're continuing to get market share. And so there can be a notion of these fast cycles and sometime it's true. The tablets went up quickly and then down. But if you take the TV category or the computing category or the smart home category, there's continuous innovation, so it's not an up and then down. And then we are able to gradually gain share over time. We do have a focus from a customer standpoint on a segment, which we call the high-touch tech fans, so people who like technology and need help with us, good news is that's a lot of us, it's not just early adopters. And that's how we take advantage of this. So, I hope it helps because that's still \u2013 a core to the strategy we're pursuing is take advantage of the assets we have to help customers and expand our business on that basis. David A. Schick - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we will go ahead... Mollie O'Brien - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Next question, please? Operator : We'll go ahead with our next question from Greg Melich of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Hi. Thanks. I'd love to \u2013 first, congrats, a great quarter and executing is huge like that. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : On the tax reform, my rough estimates here are that it's about $180 million, maybe $200 million a year savings from what your tax rate used to be to the 25%. And I just want to frame it, are we thinking about, say, roughly half of that now going with CapEx acceleration? And then given the flat guidance \u2013 given the top-line growth for margin, that maybe $50 million is going in some margin investment, given all the things you're doing. Is that a fair way to look at it when you think about how much of the tax gains you're keeping, so to speak, versus what's going back into the business or the income statement? Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Greg. I think your characterization of the annual tax savings is absolutely in the ballpark. In terms of how we are using that, we're not providing a breakdown. What is exciting, I think, is that we're able to have every one of our stakeholders benefit from this. So, clearly, we're investing in the employees of the company. We've talked about investments in additional benefits in specialty labor. We'll continue \u2013 skills and talent is key to our winning in this space, so we'll continue to invest in that. We're investing in the customer experience and all of the enablers and then, of course, the shareholders are benefiting as well. What I particularly find exciting is that while we are clearly accelerating our investments, we are able to maintain, on a comparable basis, a flat OI rate. And so it was a lot of debate actually throughout the country of how much investments-related tax savings would actually deteriorate the operating income rate. In our case, we're able to accelerate the investments, do what we need and maintain the OI rate. How is that possible? Because of the efficiencies we're driving throughout the business and, of course, the return from these investments. So, we're not providing a detailed breakdown. I think some of the estimates you had were correct. But what I want to highlight is that despite the acceleration of investments, we're maintaining a flat OI rate. We're not deteriorating the OI rate in this phase of accelerated investments. Gregory Scott Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC : Got it. Thanks. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Feldman of Telsey Group. Please go ahead. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Yeah. Hi, good morning guys, and again congratulations on the strong quarter. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : Wanted to ask about the online business. I know it was another good quarter, but just compared to the annual growth rate, it did slow a little bit. And I was just wondering if it was just because of the big comparison. Or is there anything else you're seeing there? And I know you touched on a couple of the new ideas or initiatives in the online business. If you could maybe just dive into those a little bit more in detail, that'd be great. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Yeah. So, I'll start. The size of Q4 is massively larger in our online business. And just from a seasonality perspective, this is typically what you see in the seasonality of our online growth. The top-line growth number falls back just a bit. But in terms of the percent of the business, that 20% of the business, that percent of business has continued a pretty steady march quarter to quarter to quarter to quarter. So, there wasn't anything that changed. It's just a little bit of the seasonality of the business. And what's really important and what we like to call out is that conversion was a key driver for us, which means it's not just pushing more traffic to the website that we love to do that, it is once the traffic is there the experience is so much meaningfully better that you're actually converting more customers. And that's why in the examples that we gave you around kind of the natural language search capability, that is \u2013 the last thing you want to do is bounce someone away from your website. And what do people do the minute they come to your website? They search and they search using whatever is in their heads. You search for a quiet dishwasher because that's what's important to you. And while that seems really basic, being able to pick up on those natural language cues and then give you assorted list of answers that exactly address your concern, it seems very nuanced. It's a huge deal because the faster I can get someone at the end of the day to that product that they're looking for with the closest match to their natural language request, the more the likelihood they're actually going to flow through on that purchase. And so the examples we gave you are all about that \u2013 a real end-to-end customer experience through the website and taking away as much friction as possible when someone comes to visit us. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Let me quickly add two or three things. One, with this growth rate of 18%, we believe we're getting market share online. Number two, what matters to us and probably to our investors is the overall growth rate of the company. Number three, if you do the math, you would conclude that in Q4 and for the full year, on a four-wall basis, so excluding in-store pickup and ship from store, are (57:51) stores at a very nice comp both for the full year and in Q4. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC : That's great. Thank you, guys. Good luck with this quarter. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And your final question will come from the line of Christopher Horvers of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, good morning and phenomenal quarter. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Thank you. Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC : In thinking I had two questions. So, as you think about the first quarter guide, I know Best Buy likes to be very conservative in terms of their outlook. But if I recall, there was strength more in the back half of the quarter on the Switch and I think the Galaxy and you're guiding to a pretty sharp deceleration on a one- and two-year basis. So, can you talk about that rationale? Are you seeing sharp slowdowns after a 9% in the fourth quarter? And then as a follow-up, the gross margin benefit from the price erosion efforts at the store, that seems new. Is that something that will continue as you look out into the first three quarters of this year until we sort of lap it? Thank you. Corie Barry - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Sure. So, I will try to handle those. In terms of the deceleration into Q1, you actually teed up very nicely, Chris. It was a volatile quarter last year, started quite slow, ended quite strong. And so we're thoughtful about that as we try to phase out the quarter. This is less about anything I'm seeing in this exact moment, and it's more about the things I called out in the script. One is the flat-out timing, and we said it, you had $100 million of iPhone revenue that pushed into Q4. And then you also had $100 million associated with the Super Bowl shift that pushed into Q4. So, that means those were things that were disproportionately heavy in Q4 and then would have taken actually revenue out of in the Super Bowl shift example, Q1. So, those are just real and that's about $200 million between those two that isn't comparable between the two quarters. The second is gaming, you called it out, you have to remember Switch launched last year in March. And so we are going to start lapping that and then obviously, you also called out the Galaxy which \u2013 always the timing of the launch is just a little bit different. So, those are the biggest thing \u2013 and then the last thing I would call out is that some of the general product availability issues we had in Q4 last year eased as we came into Q1. And so you just don't have that same lap that you had in Q1. I would also make sure that I call out, we talked about some of the operating income rate pressures. If you adjust it for that Super Bowl shift and the legal settlement that we had, our operating income rate would be roughly flat year-over-year on that Q1 guide. And so I want to make sure I'm clear about that, that moving that Super Bowl week out of Q1 has a pretty large impact overall both revenue and operating income on the quarter. To your second question on the price erosion, the store teams have been working on this for a while. We said that a disproportionate amount of that actually flowed through straight into Q4. We'll have a little bit going forward, but not nearly as much as I think some of the benefit that we saw out of the back part of last year. Hubert Joly - Best Buy Co., Inc.: Very good. I'm conscious of time. I want to thank all of you for your attention, your support and your kind words. It's true that this is an exciting time at the company. We see the opportunities ahead. I want to make sure I do a good job of giving credit to our associates who are delivering amazing performance for our customers. You guys rock. Have a good day. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam. Mollie O'Brien: Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Corie Barry, our CFO.  During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.  I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with a review of our first quarter performance and then provide an update on our progress against our fiscal 2019 priorities as we continue to implement our Best Buy 2020, Building The New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our outlook. So today, we're reporting a first quarter Enterprise comparable sales growth of 7.1% and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.82, which is up 37% compared to last year. This strong performance was broad-based with positive comparable sales across all channels, geographies and most of our product categories. The top line strength is a result of 3 main factors : continued healthy consumer confidence, product innovation in multiple areas of technology and our unique value proposition resonating with customers. We are executing well, and customers are responding positively to the unique experience we provide to them online, in stores and in their homes. This is, of course, tied to our continued investments in the customer experience. And so I want to thank all of our associates for their commitment to our company's purpose, to enrich lives through technology, and their continued great leadership and execution. Now we not only had a strong first quarter, we also continued to make significant progress in the implementation of our strategy. As I mentioned, our purpose as a company is clear, it is to enrich lives through technology. We aim to do this by addressing key human needs in areas such as entertainment, productivity, communication, food preparation, security and health and wellness. To fulfill our purpose and grow the company, we're focused on expanding what we sell and evolving how we sell and building the related key enablers while continuing to take costs out. I'd like to share a few examples of how we're making progress, beginning with expanding what we sell. For the first 2 examples illustrate how we are leveraging our unique assets to help leading technology companies commercialize their new products. We recently announced a partnership with Amazon that leverages our product expertise as well as our merchandising, marketing and sales know-how. In a multiyear exclusive partnership, we're working together to bring the latest generation of Fire TV-enabled smart TVs to market. The exclusivity of our partnership extends to all smart TVs with a Fire TV experience built in. The TVs will be available exclusively in Best Buy stores, on bestbuy.com and on amazon.com through Best Buy as a third-party seller. We will be rolling out more than 10 models this year beginning this June. Our unique in-store and online experience also makes us the logical partner for tech companies innovating in areas like virtual reality, which is still an emerging technology that customers need to experience in person, and Best Buy is the only retailer where customers can demo the new Oculus Go virtual reality headset from Facebook, which is now available in more than 700 stores and on bestbuy.com. Now in addition to products, we also have some very exciting services initiatives focused on expanding what we sell. The first initiative that I want to highlight is our Total Tech Support program. We rolled out Total Tech Support nationwide earlier this week after piloting the program with more than 200,000 customers in 200 stores in 10 major markets. Total Tech Support is a great example of Best Buy focus on helping customers get the most out of their technology well beyond the initial purchase transaction. For $199 per year, members get unlimited Geek Squad support online, via chat, in stores, in the palm of their hands with the new Best Buy home app. All their technology is covered no matter where or when they bought it as we believe that support should not be limited to a specific product, and we believe that the customer need is to have all their technology work together. We're launching this program nationwide at a time we hit our highest-ever NPS scores for the quality of our service delivery, setting up our members to benefit from the best Geek Squad experience we've ever delivered on all their tech. Tech support is a great value as members also receive free Internet security software and discounts on in-home services and purchases of annual Geek Squad protection and AppleCare service plans. What is equally exciting is that the features and capabilities provided by Total Tech Support will be expanded over time. The second services initiative is the health space -- is in the health space. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we're exploring the health space with a focus on older Americans. We already assort a variety of health-related products and technology products designed for seniors, like specially designed phones and medical alert systems. We're also testing a service called Assured Living to help the aging population stay healthy at home with assistance from technology products and services, and we will continue to learn and refine our approach in this space. Now turning to evolving how we sell. We continue to improve the customer experience across all of the ways our customers interact with us. In the digital channel, we're focused on streamlining the online buying process for our customers. In our stores, we continue to work with our associates to develop their proficiency and their ability to deeply understand and meet customer needs. And in the home channel, our In-Home Advisor program is ramping up well. Since launching nationwide last September, we've seen strong results similar to those we saw during our pilots. At the end of the quarter, we had 380 advisers providing free in-home consultations to help customers address their needs across our full range of products and services. While it is very important that the customer have a great experience in their first consultation, a goal of the program is that this initial interaction is the beginning of a deeper and more relationship-based experience with Best Buy over the long term. We believe the program will continue to improve and mature as our advisers are in their roles longer, master what are sophisticated skills and as we further enhance the tools and systems that help them do their jobs. In addition, we're using technology to bring together the advantages of our various channels in a way that is seamless and intuitive to customers. Here's an example. Our customers told us that it can be hard to compare products in store if you don't want to speak with an associate. So we recently launched a new app feature that makes it easy for customers to use their mobile phones to compare products when shopping in a store. With the scan to compare feature, customers can use their app to scan the QR codes of up to 3 products and then see the comparison of the specs and features of the products on their phone to help them research and determine which product best meets their needs. Now getting across all of this is how we are evolving as a company and as a brand. For the last several years with the expert service and unbeatable price tagline, we've emphasized employee expertise and price competitiveness and it has served us well. And so as we transition to our Building The New Blue strategy, it felt appropriate to elevate our brand identity. The functional elements of expertise and price are, of course, still important, but it is not the whole Best Buy story. So let me explain the essence of our new brand identity. Our brand identity starts from within, with our people. It is about how, as a company, we aim to be an inspiring friend who helps customers understand how technology can help them achieve great new things. It celebrates the role of our Blue Shirts, of our agents and all of our associates play in support of this with 3 key behaviors : be human, make it real and think about tomorrow. And our new internal and externally focused rallying cry, Let's Talk About What's Possible, encapsulates this. And one thing that is exciting is that this new brand identity celebrates who we are when we are at our best. Now you may have already begun seeing the new expression of our brand on our website, in our app and in marketing vehicles, and we continue to roll this out gradually. Importantly, our goal over time is to ensure our new brand identity comes to life in everything we do. To implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy, we are investing in a range of enablers, as we described at our Investor Day in September, across people, technology and supply chain. We are investing in areas such as specialty labor, enterprise customer relationship management, knowledge management capabilities, the new services platform and new digital tools for sales associates to help them be more productive. We've also begun a multiyear transformation of our supply chain designed to expand our bandwidth for growth and speed. We're investing to significantly increase automation, build more local distribution capabilities for online orders and expand the space and improve the customer experience for our growing sales of large products that must be delivered. To help offset our investments and pressures in the business, we continue our long-standing diligence on increasing productivity and decreasing costs. Our current productivity target established in Q2 of fiscal 2018 is $600 million in additional annualized cost reductions and gross profits optimization to be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. During the first quarter, we achieved approximately $70 million in annualized reductions, bringing the cumulative total to $305 million towards our goal. Now another element of our Best Buy 2020 strategy that we not often talk with you about is our focus on contributing to the common good. We believe businesses exist not only to deliver value to shareholders, but also to positively impact their various stakeholders and to contribute to the common good. For us, that is tied to our purpose to enrich lives through technology. And we are particularly exciting -- excited about the commitment we made last year to help prepare 1 million underserved teens for tech-reliant jobs each year by 2020. One of the ways we are and will be doing this is through our growing number of Teen Tech Centers. We're making progress in attracting a wide range of industry partners to work with us on this important effort, and we are heartened to find that companies and organizations, large and small, are eager to engage with us. So in summary, we continue to believe that we are operating in an opportunity-rich environment driven by technology innovation and customer's need for help. We are the market share leader with unique opportunities to expand what we sell and evolve how we sell and build a company that customers love. We're focused on providing services and solutions that solve real customer needs and on building deeper customer relationships. We want to provide ongoing value to our customers beyond their periodic technology product purchases to inspire them with what technology can do for them and support them to make sure all their tech is working the way they want. We are excited, of course, by our growth momentum and opportunities, and we're investing in people, technology and supply chain in support of our strategy. And we believe this has the opportunity to continue to generate significant value for our shareholders. And now I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry, for more details in our Q1 performance and our fiscal 2019 guidance. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $9.1 billion, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.82, both of which exceeded our expectations. The higher-than-expected revenue occurred in most product categories, with the home theater, computing and tablet categories being the largest drivers. The EPS was primarily driven by better-than-expected performance in both the Domestic and International segments. Our gross profit rate and SG&A rate were both in line with our expectations. SG&A dollars were higher than expected, primarily due to incremental incentive compensation expense for our field employees and increased variable costs associated with the higher revenue. A lower effective tax rate also provided a benefit of approximately $0.02 versus our earnings per share guidance. I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 6.8% to $9.1 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 7.1%. I would like to add a few clarifying points on our comparable sales calculation. First, our comparable sales are computed on like-for-like fiscal weeks and are not shifted to more closely aligned calendar weeks following last year's 53-week year. If we were to adjust our last year Q1 comparable sales to match this year's calendar week, the comp would be approximately 70 basis points higher than the 7.1% we reported. Second, as a result of our March 1 announcement to close all our Domestic Best Buy Mobile stores, we excluded these stores from our Q1 fiscal 2019 comparable sales results beginning this past March. Lastly, in Q1 fiscal 2019, we adopted new revenue recognition guidance that will change the timing of revenue recognition and the presentation of revenue for certain items. The adoption had an immaterial impact on the company's revenue and net earnings for the quarter and had no impact on cash flow. We expect the impact to be immaterial on an ongoing basis. The comparable sales base has been adjusted to incorporate minor changes in presentation as a result of the new standard. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.22 or 37% to $0.82. This increase was primarily driven by a $0.15 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate and a $0.07 per share benefit from the net share count change. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 6.3% to $8.4 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 7.1%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 17 large formats and 193 Best Buy Mobile store closures. From a merchandising perspective, the company generated comparable sales growth across most of its categories, with the largest drivers being mobile phones, appliances, computing, tablets and smart home. Domestic online revenue of $1.14 billion increased 12% on a comparable basis, primarily due to higher average order values and higher conversion. As a percentage of total Domestic revenue, online revenue increased 70 basis points to 13.6% versus 12.9% last year. Our online sales growth reflects multiple factors, including the types of products and the needs of customers. For example, in the first quarter, we lapped launches that over-indexed to the online channel last year such as the Nintendo Switch and the Samsung S8. Based on our data, we believe we continue to gain share online. We also continue to see our customers shopping in multiple channels as well as material increases in the number of customers choosing to pick up their online orders in stores. In our International segment, revenue increased 13.1% to $697 million. This was primarily driven by : comparable sales growth of 6.4%, driven by growth in both Canada and Mexico; approximately 500 basis points of positive foreign currency impact; and incremental revenue associated with 6 new large format store openings in Mexico over the past year. Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise gross profit rate decreased 40 basis points to 23.3%. The Domestic gross profit rate was 23.3% versus 23.6% last year. The gross profit rate decrease of approximately 30 basis points, was driven primarily by rate pressure in the mobile phones category and prior year legal settlement proceeds of $8 million or 10 basis points in the services category. These pressures were partially offset by gross profit optimization initiatives and an approximately $5 million legal settlement that occurred in the current year. The International gross profit rate decreased 110 basis points to 23.4%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada due to : one, lower sales in the higher-margin services category, primarily driven by the launch of Canada's Total Tech Support offer, a long-term recurring revenue model; and two, margin pressure in the computing and mobile phone category. Partially offsetting these items was a favorable legal settlement of approximately $2.8 million. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.82 billion or 20% of revenue, which increased $101 million but decreased 20 basis points versus last year. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.66 billion or 19.7% of revenue versus $1.57 billion or 19.9% of revenue last year. The $86 million increase was primarily due to : growth investments, which include specialty labor and higher depreciation expense; higher variable costs due to increased revenue; and higher incentive compensation. These increases were partially offset by the flow-through of cost reductions and reduced advertising expense. International non-GAAP SG&A was $164 million or 23.5% of revenue versus $149 million or 24.2% of revenue last year. The $15 million increase was primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and increased depreciation. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate decreased to 20% from 35.6% last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate as a result of tax reform and lower income tax expense associated with stock-based compensation. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the first quarter in line with our expectations. I would now like to talk about our Q2 and full year fiscal 2019 guidance. Our Q2 guidance reflects our expectations for continued momentum in the business as well as lapping strong comparable sales last year. It also reflects continued investments in our long-term strategy. Our second quarter outlook is the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion; comparable sales growth of 3% to 4%; Domestic comparable sales growth of 3% to 4%; International comparable sales growth of 1% to 4%; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.77 to $0.82, which is an increase of 12% to 19%; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of 25.5% to 26%; and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 285 million shares. Please note that our Q2 guidance assumes the following impacts. In the Domestic segment, the calendar shift is estimated to benefit Q2 comparable sales by approximately 150 basis points. Increased investments in supply chain as well as higher transportation costs are expected to add approximately 25 basis points of gross profit pressure. The national rollout of Total Tech Support is expected to add approximately 25 basis points of gross profit pressure because we incur costs as members tend to receive services and discounts immediately when they join the program while we recognize the related revenue equally over 12 months. I now want to spend some time talking about our full year guidance. We are pleased with the first quarter performance and the strong start to the year. We also recognize that it's early in the year and the first quarter historically has represented approximately 15% of our annual operating income. At this time, we are not updating our full year fiscal 2019 guidance provided at the start of the year. As a reminder, our full year fiscal 2019 guidance is the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $41 billion to $42 billion; Enterprise comparable sales of flat to up 2%; non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.5%, which is flat to FY '18's rate on a 52-week basis; non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $4.80 to $5, an increase of 9% to 13%. This represents an increase of 14% to 18% when compared to fiscal '18 on a 52-week basis; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; capital expenditures of $850 million to $900 million; and finally, share repurchases totaling at least $1.5 billion. As a reminder, there are additional assumptions in our annual guidance that I would like to call out. Our investments, in particular, in specialty labor, supply chain and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments, and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $35 million of lower profit share revenue, will be partially offset by a combination of return to new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiency. The increased investments in supply chain as well as higher transportation costs are expected to pressure the Domestic gross profit rate by approximately 25 basis points each quarter for the remainder of the year. The national rollout of Total Tech Support is expected to pressure the Domestic gross profit rate by approximately 15- to 20 basis points with the largest impact in our fiscal second and third quarters. We continue to expect the Best Buy Mobile small format store closures that we announced last quarter will negatively impact revenue by approximately $225 million with flat to slightly positive impacts on operating income. Finally, our guidance reflects lower annual incentive comp expense as we reset our performance target to align with our fiscal 2019 expectations. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Dan Wewer of Raymond James. Daniel Wewer : Corie, I wanted to follow up on your comments about Total Tech Support and margin implications. How do you see the gross margin rate evolving in the second year that a customer is in the program? And also if you could discuss what type of operating expenses are associated with Total Tech Support and the implications for the operating profit rate. Corie Barry : Yes. Thanks, Dan. As we look into the out-years, second, third, further years out in the program and you start to lap some of that initial first year usage, we like what we see in some of those out-years. And here's what I'd say, if you just take one step back, and I think Hubert did a nice job in his comments talking about -- our purpose here is around creating more relationships with our customers and longer-term relationships with our customers. And so both financially, but more importantly, in terms of our interaction with our customers, as you get into those out-years, it becomes a less dilutive financial model for us. In terms of our ability to deliver and fulfill on our offer, as of right now, we like the infrastructure we have in place to deliver on that. We've been testing for a while. We have a nice, broad cadre of Geek Squad agents, both who can help you remotely, who can help chat, who can help phone. And thus far, we have a lot of the infrastructure in place to actually deliver on this offer. And hence, the reason that the combination of both the customer interaction that we really, really like and the ability to already have a lot of fulfillment infrastructure in place. As time goes on, we really fundamentally believe this is the right thing to do for the business. Daniel Wewer : And then just as a quick follow-up. Inventory finished the quarter up almost 9% per square foot year-over-year. How do you see the growth in inventory playing out for the balance of the year? Corie Barry : Yes. I feel very good about our inventory situation. So I'd say a couple of things. One, big kudos to our inventory demand planning teams who have found a way to have the quality of our inventory be as good as I've ever seen it in my history here. We have less at-risk inventory than we've ever had in our history. So that's one important note. Two, we absolutely have built inventory in line with the sales figures that we've been seeing. And frankly, it is very much reflected in our NPS results, where our customers are consistently telling us one of the big drivers of that improved customer experience year-over-year is inventory availability, both online and in stores. And so I feel very good about the targeted quality of the inventory and then also the levels in support of the business we've been seeing. I think we've proven even historically that we'll ratchet that up and down as we see sales figures, but we have found it to be very much in our advantage to make sure we have the inventory there for our customers. Operator : We will now take our next question from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : A big-picture question for you, Hubert. Just regarding the Supreme Court case with South Dakota versus Wayfair in reference to state sales tax, I know you've had some public statements out there. It sounds like you're in support of a more level playing field. I guess -- but I was curious to get insights on you is, do you have a sense today of what amount of industry shares done in a tax-free environment? And then when you look at Amazon rolling out sales tax to first-party purchases, where have you seen market share lift in those states? Hubert Joly : So thank you. So yes, we are very excited about the decision of the Supreme Court to take this case and to hopefully revert Quill and, indeed, establish a level playing field. In terms of the first part of your question, there's been significant progress in the last several years in terms of pure online players collecting on their first-party sales, including Amazon today, based on our understanding, collects the sales tax across the country where there's sales tax on their first-party business. They don't, in general, on their third-party business or marketplace business. Trying to estimate this may not be very precise, but let's maybe imagine it could be half of their business, where they don't collect the sales tax. That's very meaningful. And of course, there's other players. Wayfair is party to the lawsuits. They don't collect across the country. So it is still a meaningful fight, given the large market share that Amazon first and third party enjoy online. In terms of the impact on our business, as you can imagine, on large purchases now, the average ticket in our business is not -- I mean, it's higher than most other categories, but it's not thousands of dollars. It's, let's say, it's maybe around $200 or something like this. But there's some product part of our business where customers are going to pay several hundred dollars, several thousand dollars and an 8% on, let's say, $1,000 is very meaningful. And so when we studied, in the last 5 years, really to see states start collecting the sales tax on the first-party business, it was helpful incrementally. Now as a company, we've never relied on this as a way to restore our competitiveness and move forward. But I would say it's incrementally positive as we -- not a game changer, but incrementally positive. That's how I would characterize it. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Kate McShane of Citi. Kate McShane : Corie, I was wondering if you could remind us why the calendar shift is going to have that level of impact and what week you're gaining in the second quarter. Corie Barry : Yes. So we're trying to be as clear as we can on the calendar shift here. So in second quarter, when we adjust, we keep this year the same, and we adjust last year's comp base. What that does is it takes out a week in May, the first week in May, and it brings in a week in August, the first week in August. Those August weeks are back-to-school weeks and heading into football weeks. They tend to be much heavier weeks. So you back out that lighter May week out of the base, and you put in that heavier August, pre back-to-school week. And so when you go apples-to-apples then, it takes that comp down for Q2. Q2 is the quarter with the largest week shift effect to it. As you head into the back half, it becomes much more minimal in the 50 to 70 basis point range. But this is a lot more. We thought it was important to be transparent. You pick up a lot of extra because of the shift of the weeks. Does that makes sense, Kate? Kate McShane : Yes, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up question with regards to the upside that you saw to your comp this quarter, how it compared versus your plan and how should we think about the parameters as to what could drive a higher-than-guided comp in Q2. Corie Barry : Yes. So in Q1, we saw a few things happen. And in terms of our internal plan, and I think you heard it in our prepared remarks, our incentive comp was higher than expected. That's because even versus all of our internal plans, this is a materially better outcome than we had expected. And again, we said it, we saw strength in almost every category, which was really nice coming out of holiday. In terms of potential upside into Q2, so let me take a step back. One more thing that we saw in Q1 because I think it's pertinent is you did see some pretty good overall industry health. And we had said in the prepared remarks, we're continuing to see consumer health, we continue to see industry health and then we like very much how we're positioned within those 2 things. And so we saw even NPD for our categories again only 60% roughly of what we have. But we saw NPD up about 2.8%, which is -- that reflects a good, healthy interest in technology. So as we head into Q2, there's a few things that could continue to perform better than we see right now. You could continue to see even more strength in home theater, I think, depending on how the new models hit. We came out of transition very cleanly. We've got a beautiful new set of TVs. You potentially could see a bit more strength there. We aren't expecting one of the categories that was strong. You saw in our list of categories was tablets. That had a lot to do with kind of a refresh of the line and some of the pens and things that came with some of these new tablets. We aren't expecting that to continue quite at the pace that we've been seeing. But if that demand continues to be very strong, you might some upside there. So I think there's a few -- like the boats can continue to rise. But we felt like given what we could see in front of us, the Q2 and what we're lapping from last year, we felt like the Q2 was a very reasonable, reasonable guide. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Matt McClintock of Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Yes. Actually, I would like to take the answer to the last question and kind of extrapolate it longer term. Hubert, you'd said in your prepared remarks product innovation in multiple areas. And I was trying to think about the broad-based innovation and strength we're seeing in the industry today and try to compare it to historical times when your business was strong just off of one specific product category, whether that be tablets or televisions, et cetera. Can you kind of think longer term and give us your views on how this industry -- the strength that we're seeing today -- could actually be sustainable well beyond what a typical historical product cycle has been in the past for your business? That's my first question. Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you, Matt. I think we -- and we had talked about this at Investor Day and have spoken about this consistently. I continue to be impressed by the magnitude and pace and breadth of technology innovation. What is unique in this era is how technology now gets embedded into more and more things -- lightbulbs, doorbells, large appliances, small appliances, and then how all of these products are now connected. People call this the Internet of Things and so forth and with broader and broader application. One of the things we've talked about is how technology can help people stay in their home for longer, and there's a lot of excitement around helping people do that and reduce -- improves people's health and wellness and reduce health care costs for the country. And of course, what's exciting about the future is that we're just at the beginning of this era. The penetration of these devices and the use-cases are just beginning. And so I think we are in for a -- I mean, predicting the future is always tricky. I can share with you what I believe and what we believe as a company is that we're in a cycle -- I don't even want to talk about the cycle. There's a wave that will continue to deepen and broaden, and so I think we have this positive environment. One of the reasons we talk about an opportunity-rich environment is because of this. The other reason is that even though we are a leader, market share [Audio Gap] customers is only 26%. So this gives us multiple drivers over time to really sustain significant growth for the company. Matthew McClintock : And then just as a follow-up, kind of related. Corie, you did a really good job of explaining the online business and the share gains that you're taking even at a reduced growth rate. I was just wondering, at this stage of evolution of where technology is today, are we seeing strength in the brick-and-mortar channel relative to the online channel just because consumers are less familiar with some of this product and it's for earlier stages and so they need that customer service, they need to go into the store? Is that potentially the explanation for why we're seeing that type of trend? Corie Barry : So I'm going to try to separate this into a couple of pieces. One, I do fundamentally believe that there is a need amongst consumers to touch, feel, make final decisions, particularly when you're talking about the price points that Hubert mentioned earlier and the technologies. So I do believe there's a need there. I don't want to imply that I think all the business is suddenly going to switch into the stores. I think what we're trying to say is -- and Hubert teed it up -- there is more interplay between all the channels. And I know it gets overused, but it's fundamentally true. Our data shows us, we literally do not have a customer who only shops us in one channel. I mean, there might be one. But on the whole, we don't have customers that only shop us in one channel. And I think you saw in my remarks I talked about -- like this was very much about some specific products where we had good availability, we moved through a ton online and you lap some of that. It doesn't change the fundamental belief, which is our customers are in multiple channels. I mean, the fact that we continue to see material increases in in-store pickup even with all of the fulfillment options that are available to customers just says to me people want to play amongst the channels and get things and see things and touch them in the way that they want. So I don't want to imply I think the whole world is shifting, but I think it just continues to emphasize our point of view that perfectly isolating these channels separately and talking about their growth individually is exceptionally hard to do. Hubert Joly : The other thing I would add is that back to the continued product innovation, the need to integrate these products and the need for customer for help, that plays really well to our ability to help customers across technology and product categories and ecosystems and across multiple touch points. The ability we have to help them online, in the stores and then in their home. These 2 things across product categories, ecosystems and across touch points gives us a very unique competitive advantage. So that's why you can hear and feel the excitement about the opportunities we have, and of course, you see the momentum that we have. Operator : We will now take our next question from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Michael Baker : I'm going to ask 2 questions if I could. First, not increasing the guidance. I get it's early in the year, and a lot can happen. But in the first quarter last year, I believe you did increase your guidance. So I'm just wondering if there's anything more to read into the not-increasing-guidance here except that it's early in the quarter or early in the year. Corie Barry : Genuinely, there is not more to read into. I know we did it last year. We just felt like there's so much of the year still in front of us, set it specifically at only 15%. What I would say out loud is we believe right now, we're trending toward the higher end of our revenue range, and it was a wide range we gave this year. And that's one thing, we gave much wider ranges this year even than we did last year. And so we kind of like where we're headed right now. But we just want to give ourselves plenty of room as we head through the rest of the year, given how much of the year there is left. Michael Baker : Yes, okay. That makes perfect sense. Second question, just on some of the cost. You talked about 3 things. Can you sort of give us order of magnitude between the investments presumably and things like In-Home Advisors versus higher associate pay and incentive comp? And I guess what I'm getting at is, are we still in the phase in the in-home services where you're in investment mode, where you're spending upfront for revenues to hopefully eventually catch up and start to leverage that spend? Corie Barry : Yes. So to be clear, we put those things in the order of size. So investments being the largest, the variables as the next piece and then the incentive comp being the smallest of those 3 drivers year-over-year. In terms of the investments and where we are, remember, we launched the In-Home Advisors full scale in the back half of last year and, actually, just before holiday, relatively heading into holiday. We have continued to ramp up that program since then. We, right now, ended the quarter with about 380 In-Home Advisors. They also ramped up performance to exactly your question as they become more educated, have a little bit more time in role and grow their skill base. And so you're still absolutely seeing a little bit of a mismatch between we're investing, we're training, we're bringing new people on and their productivity is ramping over time. And so I think throughout, still, this year as we add more In-Home Advisors, as they continue to gain confidence and build their book of business, you're going to continue to see that program ramp. Operator : We will take our next question from Anthony Chukumba of Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : I have 2 questions. So the first question, the 7.1% comp store sales growth in the first quarter, when is the last time you put up a comp like that in the first quarter? I -- my model just doesn't go back that far. Corie Barry : It was a long time ago. We're just focused on moving forward, Anthony. We're not going to compare it to how long it's been, but it's a long time. I could say over 10 years. Anthony Chukumba : Got it, fair enough. Fair enough. I guess I'll go back and look in the microfiche. Second question, so service -- the services business. So this is the second quarter in a row in which you've done a 7% comp in the services business. I know we sort of touched on this a little bit before. But I guess I'm just trying to figure out what's driving that because you only have 380 In-Home Advisors at this point, and you just rolled out Total Tech Support. So I'm just trying to figure out what exactly is driving the growth that we're seeing there. Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you, Anthony. The -- so to be clear, the scope of the [ slide ] does not include In-Home Advisor, because by the way, In-Home Advisor, the visits are free. What it includes is the extended warranties, installation and support services. And you're right, Total Tech Support is new. So it's not material here. I think in general, the growth of our online business is related to, of course, the growth of our product business because a lot of it is attached, and of course, we are selling more products. So that's the first driver. And then second, I think that over the last several quarters, our teams have done an increasingly good job of selling solutions and positioning not just the hardware, but also the services. So we're seeing selectively attach rates go up, and it's been helpful from that standpoint. Now of course, as we move to Total Tech Support, because of the revenue recognition that Corie described, you'll see some different direction as we move forward. But we're -- one thing I'm excited about is that the services focus is increasingly becoming a core focus of the company, and that's really apparent in the way we're launching Total Tech Support. It's not an afterthought. It's not oh, by the way, I need to sell this to you. This is a core element of our brand positioning and brand identity. So now to be clear, the focus of our strategy is not principally to drive services revenue. It's to build the relationship, the overall relationship with customers. So as we move forward, you've not heard us say the services revenue is going to be x percent of our total revenue. Services is a component of a bigger relationship, and over time, we may use services as a way to broaden the relationship with customers or as a revenue driver. It's not a goal -- the services P&L is not a goal in and of itself. Corie Barry : Anthony, just one more clarifier to just -- I know you weren't saying this, but I just want to make sure I'm clear. On the In-Home Advisor side of things, there isn't revenue associated with In-Home Advisor in and of itself. Often, it sells more services so it may drive more. But I just want to be clear. We don't characterize the products that are sold by In-Home Advisors as a services sale. That is just included in the normal product side of things. Operator : We'll take our next question from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I wanted to focus on margin, incremental margins. In the U.S. business, sales were up like $500 million. EBIT rose. I think it was just about $5 million. So I want to talk about where the buckets that are being spent on. Is it performing as you planned? Are you investing anywhere? And I think you mentioned this in the past, Corie, that there's not many places you can speed up investments. So you're probably investing ratably. But just trying to think about flow-through, where you are on the continuum and in the context of not promising much margin upside over time, but just thinking about flow-through. Corie Barry : Yes. So we -- the investments that we hit on were paced roughly how we expected them to be paced, both on the people side and on the capital side. And so I'd characterize our investment profile as very much in line with what we had expected and how we had guided. There was, this time around, some gross profit rates pressure, which we had also guided for and, in fact, was a little bit better than even what we had guided for, meaning it was a little less of a drain year-over-year. And really, that had to do with some of the evolving economics of mobile, which we've talked about quite a bit, somewhat offset by some of the cost reduction. I think Q1 is continuing on the journey that we laid out, which is, for the year, a relatively flattish OI rate on a 52-week basis. We're going to make these investments ratably over the year, so that we can continue to ramp up some of the things we talked about, like In-Home Advisor and Total Tech Support. We feel like it's important to get this running start early in the year. And frankly, I'm exceptionally proud of the team to have, even in a more rapid way than in some prior years, ramped up some of the technology builds and some of the physical work in the stores even faster than we've done historically. So I think we're -- we feel like we're right on pace with what we would expect, and we feel like we're investing in the right things. We're monitoring the returns, and then trust me, if they're not returning the way that we think they should be, we're going to make some different decisions. Simeon Gutman : And if I can follow up just on the TV category. Can you share with us how units are performing for you, if you can disclose that? And then for ASPs, I think that's -- it's been an ASP increasing story. Can you share with us if that's accelerating, decelerating or staying the same? Corie Barry : Yes. So broadly, in TVs, we -- it's a better performance than we expected. We continue to see a similar theme for us, which is ASPs continue to increase, and so we like the positioning of the category. We saw unit growth decelerate a little bit for us in Q1, but like I said, better than even our internal projections. And so I think versus the industry, there's a little bit of noise in the industry numbers, because again, that 53rd week makes things funky. We think we were like roughly flattish versus the industry, maybe down just a little bit. But we like the positioning. We like that we transitioned very cleanly into the new lines, and we're excited with the lines that we have heading into Q2. Operator : We'll now take our next question from David Schick of Consumer Edge Research. David Schick : Just wanted to walk through the math, the recapture math on the Best Buy Mobile stores that are closing. How many of those customers are you seeing back in the store? How's that going? Are you losing them -- you would lose some, are you losing them at any different rate than you expect? Corie Barry : Yes. So it's obviously very early in us closing all these stores, so it's a little bit early to comment broadly on what you're seeing when it's a closure of this size. We obviously have been closing some stores over time, and so we have a relatively good feel for recapture rates based on that. Based on those expectations, so far, we're not seeing anything that would give us pause or worry us that this is kind of turning out in a different way than we would have expected. But like I said, it's still very early in closing these stores. Operator : We'll take our next question from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : So I guess my first question is more bigger-picture perspective. You now put up 2 consecutive quarters of really solid, outsized sales growth. It's clearly happening as you --as there's been a number of internal initiatives at Best Buy, but also where we've seen sales across retail pick up as well. So the question I have is as you look at your data and you know your customers really well, how much of what we're seeing right now, from an industry demand perspective, is potentially a catch-up, maybe after a period of more subdued spending versus actual true demand that could prove more sustainable? Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you for highlighting the last 2 quarters. For a minute, I would like to -- the last 4 quarters of comp's above 4%. You see there's no doubt that the consumer environment is better. And you're right, we're seeing strong numbers across many, many retailers. The -- of course, I think our numbers are higher than probably most retailers, I would say. In our case, it's really a combination, right? So you have the consumer that is feeling better. You have the continued housing recovery, it's helpful. And it's the technology innovation that's driving us, and of course, we're continuing to gain market share. So we have 3 engines, if you will, driving our current growth. Now of course, if one of the engines slows down, that's going to have an impact. But it doesn't impact the other 2 engines. So now on the 7%, what percentage is -- the first one is hard to know. What we know is that the combination of the first and the second is material because Corie highlighted NPD at 2.8%. Again, it's a fraction of what we do, but we all remember the days where NPD was negative. And so the combination of the first 2 factors is helping this, no doubt. Hard to know between the first and the 2, what is the breakdown. Brian Nagel : Okay, that's -- that is helpful. The second question I have is sort of one. With regards to TVs,, I think it's a follow-on to a prior question, but obviously, still very early here in 2018. The holiday season still a ways off. But how should we think about just some of the innovations in the TV category that we'll see through the balance of this year as a potential sales driver in that important category versus what we've seen maybe in the last year, last couple of years? Corie Barry : I mean, I think this is a space where we've actually talked a lot about the idea of continued innovation and evolution, and it is definitely a space where we get the cycle question a lot. And instead, I think it's actually turning into something that is more like what you're asking, which is it started with 4K. Creeping up behind that, you can see technologies around OLED or QLED, HDR technologies, 8K on the horizon. I think that -- the far horizon, by the way, but still on the horizon. And I think this evolution of the technologies over time is going to continue to be the case in TV, and for us, it's why we think it's so important to highlight those new technologies. The second piece that I would say it's not just about technology. It is still also about size. There are still a lot of people who want to have a larger TV experience. And so that combination of the 2, I think it creates a lot of runway for people to experience both really cool technologies, but also frankly, just having a lot more TV for their money in their homes. Operator : We'll now take our final question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : A lot of my questions have been answered, so -- but I did want to go back to something that Simeon touched on and just make sure I understood the answer. And I hate to be so short-term focused, but it seems like with the 7% comp, the -- call it the flow-through or the profitability really would've been -- I thought it would've been more. And I guess I'm just trying to understand why it was -- the quarter was great, so I'm not trying to be overly critical here, honestly. I'm just trying to understand why maybe there wasn't as much flow-through. Corie Barry : Yes. So let me try to lay out kind of the 2 sides of this. On one side, especially as it relates to SG&A, we said out loud for the year, we were going to continue to invest against our strategic priority. The guide that we even gave for Q1 would say we're starting that investment early in the year. We're starting it in Q1 because we want to ramp as we go through the year. And so we knew there would be investments, and then we said on top of that, some level of variability in SG&A. The pressure in margin -- gross profit, excuse me, that we talked about was really a function of, and we talked about this, kind of that continued evolution of the mobile space and a bit of pressure there, and again, something we have seen in front of us and we assumed would be the case for the quarter. The teams are continuing to do excellent work in both gross profit optimization initiatives. They're continuing to pull cost out of the model. But we knew the phasing of the year. We knew we would be making some investments even earlier in the year. So even on the 7% comp, the gross profit pressure side of things, that's not going to change as much on the 7% comp. That's more volume. That's the mix of business that you're doing. And then on the SG&A side, like we said a couple of things that came up that we hadn't had in our forecast, is a comp this big and the incentive compensation that flows through with that. And so -- I mean, I think it's tough because from our internal perspective, most things were in line with what we would've expected for the quarter, except for we actually just saw a lot better performance than we expected and, therefore, got that wonderful opportunity to share that with our employees, which is not a bad situation. Hubert Joly : Yes. And what I would add is that one of the things that are pleasing, I was going to say, is that we're able also to drive the top line, make the investments we're making. And because we're able to offset them, that profitability -- you're not seeing a [ drag ] of our -- a significant [ drag ] in our margin. There's others who are in a different situation from that standpoint. And so we likely -- it's really in line with what we had discussed at Investor Day, which is we're pushing the transformation of the company, pushing to growth. We're not trying to increase the profitability because we are trying to position the company for the future, continue to position the company for the future. There's -- a key belief we have is that the return for the winners in this space are going to be outsized because there's going to be greater and greater differentiation between winners and losers. And so this is the time, clearly, to invest, and we are pleased to be able to offset a lot of the investments. That's not to minimize your question, but stepping back and thinking strategically at what we're trying to do, we are pleased to be able to grow the company while continuing to increase the earnings. And we fundamentally believe there is significant shareholder value-creation opportunity as we move forward. So because of time, I'm going to just very briefly close and thank you all for your attention and reiterate my immense gratitude and appreciation and admiration for all of the associates at the company, who are delivering these results and who are helping customers enrich their lives through technology every day. It's beautiful to watch the leadership and the talent that exists at the company. And many of you are customers, so I appreciate your support as well. Have a great day. Thank you.

Welcome to Best Buy\u2019s Q2 Fiscal Year 2019 Earnings. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 :00 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019ll now turn the conference call over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O\u2019Brien: Good morning and thank you. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Corie Barry, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earning release, which is available on our website investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we\u2019ll make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the Company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company\u2019s current earnings release and our most recent 10-K, for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin today with a review of our second quarter performance and provide an update on our progress as we continue to implement Best Buy 2020 : Building the New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our outlook. We are happy to report strong top and bottom line results for the second quarter that exceeded our expectations. We grew our Enterprise comparable sales by 6.2% and we delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.91, which is up 32% compared to last year. The top-line performance was broad-based with positive comparable sales across all channels, geographies and most product categories. Our strong revenue growth was helped by the favorable environment in which we operate and driven by how customers are responding to the unique and elevated experience we\u2019re building. We are particularly encouraged with the continued progress of our Net Promoter Scores and our continued market share gains. We also saw our second quarter non-GAAP operating income rate expand by 20 basis points to 3.8%, this fits with our guidance for flat operating income rates for the year, driven by our ability to drive cost take out that helps offset investments and pressures in the business. So, I want to thank all of our associates across the Company for their hard work in delivering these great results. So, we\u2019re pleased with the strength of our financial performance. We\u2019re also excited about the progress we\u2019re making as we execute our Best Buy 2020 strategy which entails expanding what we sell and evolving how we sell. Let me provide a few highlights, starting with our acquisition of GreatCall. Earlier this month, we announced our intent to acquire GreatCall, a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers. GreatCall offers easy to use mobile products and connected devices tailored for seniors. These are combined with a range of services including a simple one touch connection to U.S. based specially-trained agents who can connect the user to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel. Our acquisition of GreatCall is exciting for five reasons. First, it is right in line with our strategy. Our purpose as a Company is service to enrich lives through technology by addressing key human needs. One of these needs we highlighted during our Investor Day meeting last September is health and wellness, the space we\u2019ve decided to expand into with a focus on aging consumers and how technology can help them live a more independent life. Second reason, the health market is an exciting space, especially as it relates to seniors. There are approximately 50 million people over the age of 65, a number expected to grow by more than 50% within the next 20 years. Helping this fast-growing population live longer in their homes, provide significant benefits not only for seniors and their families, but also for payers and providers. Third reason, we\u2019re acquiring a great company. GreatCall is a profitable, growing, recurring revenue business that already has more than 900,000 paying subscribers and more than $300 million in annual revenue. They have an established expertise in serving the aging population and their caregivers and they have a strong management team and a culture that is well aligned with Best Buy\u2019s. Fourth reason, we see significant value-creation opportunities, driving an attractive return on investment. The combination of their products, services, and expertise with Best Buy assets, including our merchandising, marketing, sales and service capabilities, provides the opportunity to both scale their existing consumer business and pursue commercial opportunities with payers and providers. Finally, we believe this acquisition can be a beachhead for Best Buy in the health space, providing the entry point to more growth opportunities. We expect to close this transaction by the end of the third quarter. We anticipate the impact on our non-GAAP earnings to be neutral this year and next year as we invest in the business and accretive to earnings by our fiscal \u201821. The second highlight of the quarter is the rollout of our new Total Tech Support program. We launched the program nationally at the end of May and we\u2019re pleased with the initial results. Our retail teams are very engaged and excited about the program. And customer sign-ups are in line with our expectations. From a financial standpoint, the impact of the rollout on our domestic gross profit was in line with the expectation we shared last quarter. As a reminder, for $199 per year Total Tech Support members get unlimited Geek Squad support online via chat, in-stores in the palm of their hands with the new Best Buy home app. All their technology is covered, no matter where or when they bought it, as we believe that support should not be limited to a specific product and that the customer need is to have all their technology work together. Members also receive free internet security software and discounts on in-home services and purchases of annual Geek Squad protection and AppleCare service plans. We are working on additional capabilities as we continue to advance the program. And we believe our current rollout is just the beginnings in terms of the benefits we will offer members over time. I think, you\u2019ll all be happy to know that you will be able to purchase A Total Tech Support membership as a gift for someone else this holiday season, which is something customers have been asking us for. A third highlight of the quarter is the launch of the first Fire TV Edition smart TV that\u2019s part of our product development partnership with Amazon. This partnership is a great example of how we are leveraging our expertise and unique merchandising, marketing and sales assets to help leading technology companies commercialize their new products. As a reminder, the TVs are available only in Best Buy stores on bestbuy.com and on Amazon.com through Best Buy as a third-party seller. We\u2019re planning to launch additional models in September and October. A fourth highlight of the quarter has been the rollout of our new brand rallying cry : Let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s possible. The rollout included training sessions or brand rallies across the Company including our stores. Each store dedicated significant time on a Saturday in June to immerse all store associates in the new rallying cry. The rallying cry and the related guiding behaviors which are Be Human, Make It Real, and Think About Tomorrow, are resonating strongly with our associates and are a source of inspiration for all of us. In line with this, the fifth highlight of the quarter is the continuing progress of the proficiency of our associates and of the quality of our execution across channels that is driving enhanced Net Promoter Scores and revenue growth. The level of knowledge of our sales associates and their focus on addressing the needs of our customers in a helpful and inspiring fashion is exciting to watch. In fact, I\u2019m pleased to announce that according to the JD Power 2018 Appliance Retailer Satisfaction Study, Best Buy ranked highest in customer satisfaction amongst appliance retailers for the second year in a row. Another highlight of the quarter is the continued expansion of our In-Home Advisor program. Based on the strength of demand, we\u2019ve increased the number of advisors from 300 in September last year at the beginning of nationwide launch to more than 430 at the end of the second quarter. As a reminder, our In-Home Advisors provides free in-home consultations to help customers address their needs across our full range of products and services. The goal of the program is that the initial consultation is the beginning of a deeper and more relationship-based experience with Best Buy over the long term. Like our Total Tech Support offer, we are early in the journey and expect the program to continue to improve and mature as our advisors are in their roles longer and master with our sophisticated skills, and as we further enhance the sophistications of the tools and systems that help them do their job. In addition, we\u2019re continuing to use technology to improve and streamline the online buying experience for our customers and to bring together the advantages of our various channels in a way that is intuitive to customers. As a result, based on the data we have, we believe we are continuing to gain market share online. And while are of course focused on continuing to drive online revenue, we are more and more focused on how to build deeper relationships and drive total revenue from customers. We are pleased with our overall revenue growth and the progress we are making on continuing to improve the customer experience across all the ways our customers want to engage with us. For example, to further improve the buy online pickup in store experience, our mobile app home screen will display the order ID barcode when an online order is ready for pickup in a store, reducing the amount of time the customer has to spend at the pickup counter. Another example is related to improving the research process. Customers perform research in stores by scanning product tags and getting information and reviews. However, they often lose track of products discounts once they leave the store. And so, we\u2019ve added a feature called scan history to the Best Buy app to retain customer\u2019s product scan and scan to compare history so that they can reference it and continue research after leaving the store. So, as we implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy and in support of expanding we sell and evolving how we sell as I just outlined, we\u2019re continuing to invest in a range of enablers across technology, people and supply chain. Specifically, we\u2019re continuing to invest in areas such as specialty labor, enterprise customer relationship management, knowledge management capabilities, and our new service platform. In the supply chain area, we are investing to increase capacity, further increase speed of delivery and drive efficiency. As an example of this, we recently opened a new distribution center in Compton, California. Compared to the old center we were leasing in Chino, California, the new distribution center is wholesale to consumers with 50 million consumers within 50 miles. This center has significantly more capacity for our growing large cube categories like large appliances and large TVs. And as a result, we\u2019ve seen significant improvements in our productivity and home delivery Net Promoter Scores. We\u2019re also using a section of this 600,000 square foot facility to build out a completely new automated system that will facilitated faster and more efficient online order delivery to the local metro area as well as the whole West Coast. To help offset our investments and pressures in the business, we continue our long-standing diligence on increasing productivity and decreasing cost. Our current target established in Q2 of last fiscal year is $600 million in additional annualized cost reductions and gross profit optimization to be completed by the end of fiscal \u201821. During the second quarter, we achieved approximately $70 million in additional annualized reductions, bringing the cumulative total to $375 million towards our goal. So, looking ahead. As a result of the strong performance in the first half of year and our updated expectations for the back half, we are raising our full year sales and earnings guidance. We now expect fiscal 2019 comparable sales growth of 3.5% to 4.5% versus our original guidance of flat to 2% and we are raising our expectations for our non-GAAP diluted EPS to a range of $4.95 to $5.10 versus our original guidance of $4.80 to $5. We continue to expect an approximately flat non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.5% for the year. Corie will provide further details on our outlook for the full year and Q3. You\u2019ll note that the profile of the next two quarters is not completely linear as we\u2019re expecting an operating income rate decline in Q3 followed by an increase in Q4 to result in an approximately flat rate for the year. Typical to the past several years, we remain focused on managing the business for long-term success rather than ensuring the straight line quarterly margin performance. In conclusion, we are very excited about the opportunities in front of us, enriching lives with technology and providing services and solutions that solve real customer needs and build deeper customer relationships and the related value-creation opportunities that this entails. So, I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the leadership, passion, talent, ingenuity and hard work of our associates across the Company. You are making it all possible. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Corie Barry for more details on our Q2 performance and our fiscal 2019 guidance. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our second quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $9.4 billion, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.91, both of which exceeded our expectations. We saw better than expected top-line results across multiple categories, with home theater, gaming, health and wearables and mobile phones being the largest drivers. Our gross profit rate was in line with our expectations, whereas our SG&A rate was favorable due to the higher revenue combined with slightly lower than expected spend. I will now talk about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 4.9% to $9.4 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 6.2%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.22 or 32% to $0.91. This increase was primarily driven by an $0.08 per share benefit driven by a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate and $0.08 per share benefit from the net share count change and the flow through of higher revenue. Our comparable sales growth of 6.2% included a 150 basis-point benefit from the calendar shift. As we discussed last quarter, our reported comparable sales are computed on like-for-like fiscal week and are not shifted to more closely aligned calendar week following last year\u2019s 53-week year. For the remainder of the year, in Q3, we expect the calendar shift to have a negative impact of approximately 70 basis points on our reported comparable sales and in Q4 we expect a positive impact of approximately 50 basis points. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 4.4% to $8.6 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 6%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 292 Best Buy Mobile and 17 large-format store closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were home theater, computing, appliances, gaming, mobile phones and smart home. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our digital imaging and tablet category. Domestic online revenue of $1.21 billion was 14% of domestic revenue compared to 13.2% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 10.1% on top of 31.2% growth in the second quarter of last year, primarily driven by higher conversion and increased traffic. Let me take a minute to provide a couple of additional points on this topic. As Hubert said, we are pleased with our overall revenue growth and the progress we are making on improving the customer experience. We believe based on the most recent data we have, we are continuing to gain market share online. Regarding our online comp specifically, I would add that the consumer electronics category is a more mature online category than several other retail categories, with customer buying patterns moving online earlier than most. As many of you know, we have been focused on our multi-channel capabilities and have been investing heavily for several years. For example, we have been offering our customers the option to buy online and pickup in store for more than 10 years, and all our stores have been shipping product to fulfill online orders since the beginning of 2014. In the last five years, we have doubled our online sales and on an annual basis, they are now approximately 15% of our total domestic sales. Now, back to our Q2 sales results. In our International segment, revenue increased 10.8% to $740 million. This was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 7.6%, driven by both Canada and Mexico, incremental revenue associated with six new large-format store openings in Mexico over the past year, and approximately 60 basis points of positive foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit. The Enterprise gross profit rate decreased 30 basis points to 23.8%. The Domestic gross profit rate was 23.8% versus 24% last year. The rate decline of approximately 20 basis points was driven primarily by higher supply chain costs from both, investments and higher transportation expense as well as the national rollout of our Total Tech Support offer. Both of these were in line with the expectations we shared last quarter of approximately 25 basis points of pressure each. These pressures were partially offset by higher overall product margin rate, which included the benefit of our gross profit optimization initiative. From a category perspective, increases in the smart home and appliance categories were partially offset by rate pressure in mobile phones and computing. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 200 basis points to 23.1%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, driven by lower rates in the home theater and mobile phone categories. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise SG&A was $1.88 billion or 20% of revenue, which increased $47 million but decreased approximately 50 basis points versus last year. Domestic SG&A was $1.71 billion or 19.8% of revenue versus $1.67 billion or 28.2% of revenue last year. The $43 million increase was primarily due to growth investments, which include specialty labor, higher depreciation expense, and higher variable costs due to increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by cost reductions and lower incentive compensation. The specialty labor investments include additional dedicated labor in areas such as In-Home Advisor, appliances, and smart home. In addition, it also includes the impact of competitive wage and benefit investments we have made in relation to rising wage rates across the retail industry. As we\u2019ve stated in prior quarters and on our investor day, increasing wage rates are an ongoing pressure in our business that we are balancing with a combination of returns from a new initiative and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies. International SG&A was $165 million or 22.3% of revenue, versus $161 million or 24.1% of revenue last year. The $4 million increase was primarily due to increased variable costs associated with higher revenue and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate decreased to 25.4% from 32.6% last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate, as a result of tax reform. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the second quarter in line with our expectations. We returned approximately $500 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. As it relates to our acquisition of GreatCall, we plan to use existing cash for the $800 million purchase. The acquisition of GreatCall is not expected to impact our previously communicated plan to spend $1.5 billion on share repurchases this fiscal year. I would not like to talk about our annual and Q3 guidance. As Hubert mentioned, we are raising our full year guidance for revenue and EPS to reflect the outperformance in the first half of the year and our expectations for the back half. For the full year, we are now expecting the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $42.3 billion to $43.7 billion; Enterprise comparable sales increase of 3.5% to 4.5%; non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.5%, which is flat to fiscal 2018\u2019s rate on a 52-week basis; non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $4.95 to $5.10, an increase of 12% to 15%, this represents an increase of 17% to 21% when compared to fiscal 2018 on a 52-week basis; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and capital expenditures of approximately $850 million. There are assumptions in our annual guidance that I would like to remind you of. We continue to expect the Best Buy Mobile small-format store closures to negatively impact revenue by approximately $225 million, with flat to slightly positive impact on our operating income. Our investments, in particular in specialty labor, supply chain, and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business, including approximately $40 million of lower profit share revenue in the fourth quarter will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiency. Specifically, the higher supply chain costs from increased investments and higher transportation expense are expected to pressure the domestic gross profit rate by approximately 25 basis points. The national rollout of Total Tech Support is expected to pressure the domestic gross profit rate by approximately 15 to 20 basis points. Also, our guidance reflects lower annual incentive compensation expense in the fourth quarter as at the beginning of the year we reset our performance target to align with our 2019 expectations. Finally, our guidance does not reflect any impact from the GreatCall acquisition, as we are pending close of the deal. As Hubert stated earlier, we expect the impact of the acquisition to be neutral to our non-GAAP earnings in fiscal 2019. As Hubert also mentioned earlier, the quarterly composition in terms of year-over-year operating income rate performance is not linear and we expect more pressure on our operating income rate in Q3 than the other quarters in the year. I would note that this is consistent with how we saw the composition of the quarter\u2019s unfolding at the beginning of the year. Our Q3 outlook is as follows : Enterprise revenue in the range of $9.4 billion to $9.5 billion; comparable sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5%; Domestic comparable sales growth of 2.5% to 3.5%; International comparable sales growth of 2% to 4%; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.79 to $0.84; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; and our diluted weighted average share count of approximately 281 million shares. A few additional comments specific to our third quarter guidance. As I mentioned earlier, the calendar shift is estimated to negatively impact Q3 domestic comparable sales by approximately 70 basis points. We expect to see our gross profit rate pressured due to the following. One, approximately 30 basis points of gross profit pressure from supply chain, including increased investments as well as higher transportation costs; two, approximately 20 basis points from the rollout of Total Tech Support as we incur costs as members tend to repeat services and discounts immediately when they join the program while we recognize the related revenue equally over 12 months; and three, while we experienced these pressures in Q2 as well, we partially offset them with better year-over-year merchandise margins including the impact of gross profit optimization initiative. As we knew in plan [ph] for when we entered the year, we are lapping a unique collection of benefits that occurred in Q3 of last year and thus do not expect as much merchandise margin expansion in Q3 of this year. We expect the SG&A dollar growth rate to be in the low single digits. This is largely due to higher investments, particularly higher depreciation expense and specialty labor including investments in competitive wages and benefits. In addition, due to timing of incentive compensation accruals last year, we expect to see slightly higher incentive compensation costs in Q3 before the material year-over-year decline expected in Q4. Finally, due to the calendar shift this year, which results in Q3 ending a week closer to the holiday season, we expect to end the third quarter with an inventory balance increase of approximately 18% compared to the third quarter of last year. On a like-for-like calendar basis, our Q3 ending inventory balance is expected to be up just slightly compared to last year. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot of for taking my question. Hubert Joly : Good morning, Michael. Michael Lasser : What the slope of growth in services going to look like from here? Should we expect that that particular comp rate should accelerate? And as that becomes a bigger piece of the business, how is that going to affect the gross margin over time? Corie Barry : Yes. I\u2019ll start and then Hubert can add. And you were cutting out a little bit, but I think what you were looking for was the slope of the growth on services and how that could potentially impact the margin profile. Obviously pleased with the growth that we saw and reported in Q2. But most of that growth transparently is still coming from our more traditional warranty business. Obviously, we\u2019re starting to see revenue flow from the Total Tech Support offer, but that is as we\u2019ve talked about, amortized over 12 months, so takes a little bit longer to ramp. We were excited about the trajectory of the business and believe especially as we get deeper into the growth trajectory of Total Tech Support that will help add some of that ongoing growth to the topline and the stability of the business. And so, we\u2019re not going to guide services in particular. But at the end of the day we like, and the subscriptions are right inline where we thought we would be at this point and they\u2019re going to start to add value, particularly as consumers still see value in the existing warranty portfolio that we offer in the business. To your point on the margins specifically, as we delve deeper into and have more of that recurring relationship with our customers, that is certainly not harmful on a margin basis over time, but what\u2019s more important to us genuinely transparently is making sure that we\u2019re serving the customers and we\u2019re developing that longer term, stickier relationship with them. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re most focused on at this point. Hubert Joly : Yes. I was going to comment on that -- the Best Buy 2020 strategy, as strong solutions and services orientation, but it is not always translated into service revenue. And a clear example of that is the In-Home Advisor program. As I said on the call and as you know, the first visit is free and then and it results in sale into products and some services revenue. The broader orientation is really focusing all of our activities on the customer needs and building the relationship with the customer. The biggest opportunity is in the expansion of our share of wallet of our existing and prospective customers, which is still today around 25%, 26%, as we discussed at our Investor Day. So, while we report and track services revenue, the strategy is much bigger than this particular line in revenue breakdown. Michael Lasser : And Hubert, I have one more question for you. Given the healthy results that the vast [ph] merchant achieved in the consumer electronics category this quarter, is this the point in the cycle where there is going to be a handoff from the specialty channel to the mass channel? And if not, why is this time different? Hubert Joly : So, again, you\u2019re cutting a little bit in and out. I think you were asking about whether we intend to have a handoff of our business to the mass channel. The clear answer is absolutely not. We noted, like everyone else, the strong results of number of other retailers including in the category. Bear in mind that everybody\u2019s business is different in terms of mix. So, depending on their category and the quarter, the headline number can be high. But, we note that we continue to gain market share across all of the categories that we compete in. And there is absolutely no intension to have a handoff. We are polite and sort of nice, but not to this point. We think that we are building an elevated and unique customer experience. If your customer that is excited about technology and is looking for help and support and a relationship, we are building something that\u2019s very, very special. And we feel it\u2019s working. So, I know in the past, there has been this idea that once technology matures, it goes to the mass channel and then we have to move on. That\u2019s not at all what we are seeing; that\u2019s not at all the intention. And we\u2019re very excited about the opportunities we have to build a very unique customer experience and deep sticky customer relationships. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Matt Fassler : Thanks a lot and good morning. I\u2019d like a little more color on the comments you made on online and the maturation of online. Obviously, there is lots of nuance I\u2019m sure within that. Are there categories that are still growing at a rapid rate online? And is there ongoing innovation that you think could reignite elements of the categories you think about your e-commerce opportunity here? Hubert Joly : Thank you, Matt. To be clear, we continue to very excited by online and all of the digital capabilities we\u2019re building for our customers. When I see how we\u2019ve evolved over the last 5 or 6 years, customer experience on the site and the app, the delivery, all of this, we look at things and I say, oh my God, our teams are really doing some great things. What we are referring to is a number of things. One is, as you will all appreciate, consumer electronics was one of the first categories that started to move online, and so the overall penetration is higher than in other categories. In fact, in our business, online is about 15% of our business. So, we\u2019ve doubled the business, we\u2019ve gone from $3 billion six years ago to now $6 billion. You\u2019ll also note that we\u2019ve been a pioneer. I mean, we\u2019ve been doing in-store pickup for more than 10 years and we started ship from store in 2014. So, with our teams, we continue to be investing in the shopping experience, but the angle is shifting a bit and is in line with our Best Buy 2020 strategy, which is to build a broader customer relationship with our customers across all the touch points to use technology to improve the experience whether it\u2019s in research, whether it\u2019s in the shopping, whether it\u2019s in services with our Geek Squad, we\u2019re able to remotely help you with the support of your product. So, on a category-by-category basis, there is some products when there is a hot game console that tends to fly off the shelf. It\u2019s really a well-known product and commodity. When it\u2019s a more complex buying experience, then the customers will appreciate having conversation, seeing the experience -- experiencing the products in the stores and so and so forth. So, I think yes, it\u2019s maturing, we\u2019ll continue to invest but it\u2019s a broader approach in the category. Corie, anything you\u2019d like to add, no? Okay. Matt Fassler : If there is an opportunity for a very brief follow-up within that context, the entertainment software business reaccelerated having declined in Q1 and outperformed the chain against the very tough compare. Any specific drivers of that category\u2019s bounce back? Corie Barry : Yes. So, what we saw, there was some -- a little bit unexpected strength in gaming and a couple of facets on that. One, as we talked about before, we tend to over index on gaming consoles. And that is where we saw some particular strength across consoles. And secondarily, as we mentioned last quarter, we continue to see strength in some of the accessories and peripherals as games like and social games, in particular like Fortnite take off, there are accessories that tend to make that a more compelling gaming experience. And so, we saw a little bit better results even than we expected in that category. Operator : And our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Can you please talk about your latest thoughts on the potential impact of tariffs and specifically how you view the price elasticity in the categories where you see risk? Hubert Joly : So, there\u2019s been a number of waves tariff increases over the last several months, starting with select appliances, and then the $36 billion with China followed by another $14 billion with China at the rate of 25%. Those results in our guidance reflect the impact of these tariffs. Not surprisingly, when there is a price increase, there is an impact. And in that context, while we -- I\u2019m going to say, [indiscernible] the administration is doing some very important international trade goals, and these are difficult negotiations. We\u2019ve been in dialogue with them on how to minimize the impact on consumers, and you\u2019ve seen that in the $50 billion, the 36 plus 14, there is less consumer electronics products than originally contemplated. So, I think specifically it\u2019s been reported that the tariffs have had some impact on appliances during the first half of the year. It\u2019s not completely easy to measure, because a lot of the appliance purchases -- the stress situation where your fridge is broken, it\u2019s not a discretionary decision, which is why we\u2019re going to continue to be in close dialogue with the administration as we look ahead to minimize the disruption on the U.S. consumer and the U.S. economy. Scot Ciccarelli : Are there specific areas in terms of price elasticity where to the degree that there is price increases that you\u2019re kind of forced to pass on where you don\u2019t think you can make it up in the velocity? Hubert Joly : Yes. Specifically, the impact is going to be tightly linked to the gross profit margin rates on the products. When gross profit rate is very low, then -- let\u2019s say 25% -- let\u2019s say gross profit rate is 20% on that particular product, 25% increase in the tariff is going to essentially result in a 20% price increase. There are material members. On the other hand, anytime our gross profit rate is materially higher, so let\u2019s say 50%, then the impact, if we pass everything along is cut in half. And so, that\u2019s a key differentiator. Of course, it\u2019s also related to the ability of our vendors to observe the tariffs, and of course we are having negotiations, or over time, usually not in the short term but over time, to diversify the supply base. So, it\u2019s a complex undertaking. Of course, we are very much following this and ongoing dialogue continues as we want to be sensitive, and I know the administration is as well, to the impact on the American families, workers, schools, small businesses and so forth. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the home theater strength that you saw in the quarter? Maybe parse out the share that you\u2019re seeing the there, unit growth versus ASP, and whether or not the Amazon partnership sort of lifted that comp as a result of Prime Day and the launch of the product? Corie Barry : So, good morning, Chris. What we did see and what we like is very strong market growth, and leading to very strong consumer interest in the category. So, that is one of the most exciting things. Obviously, per what we can see in NPV, TVs were up double-digit growth in Q2. So, that is excellent. Also, similar to the industry and what we could see in the industry, units were up, while ASPs were down. We are lapping some pretty significant share gains from TVs last year. And we saw just a little bit of share decline, but honestly on the size of the industry strength, we saw very minimal and in fact less than we saw in Q1. So, we like the positioning, we\u2019re excited that the consumer is adopting it. And we\u2019ve always said, we\u2019d expect that our share gains moderate over time. We also said we wouldn\u2019t expect them to drop off a cliff and to completely off the business to Hubert\u2019s point. And so, we like that the consumer is excited, we like the amount of volume that we\u2019re seeing in the category and we very much like our positioning within it. Chris Horvers : Understood. And then\u2026 Corie Barry : I\u2019m sorry, the part of your question. Let me make sure I hit on, you asked specifically about Amazon. Obviously, we\u2019re not going to comment on specific skews. But partnerships like this and the idea of interesting technology evolution continuing in categories like this, I think that\u2019s what\u2019s actually more important because I think this idea that we can showcase these technologies in unique way that no one else can, that\u2019s what\u2019s the real differentiator here. So, while I\u2019m not going to give you exactly what those skews delivered, certainly we like the idea being able to showcase this technology that no one else really can. Chris Horvers : Understood. And then, help us think about the fourth quarter. It looks like your implied comp for the fourth quarter, based on the rates is sort of flattish, I think at the high end. So, can you just reflect back and talk about what last year what you thought was sort of one time in shift versus what you really think the underlying business will look like in the fourth quarter ex those shifts? Corie Barry : Yes. So, based on the comp deltas that we\u2019re seeing, and remember we have the 53rd week in Q4, so it gets a little tricky. The guide would imply a comp of basically flat to up 3%, somewhere in that range for Q4. And so, within that as we\u2019re lapping what we saw last year. Remember, last year we specifically called out some incredible strength in gaming, particularly due to the switch which we knew we would be comping against this year. And last year, we were comping against some of the product availability issues from the year prior, so two years ago. Those are the pieces that we\u2019ve factored out. And instead what we\u2019re looking at is we head into Q4 this year is some of that continued strength in those very four categories, smart home, computing, home theater, appliances, the places that we feel very strong about our positioning with the consumer and what we bring to the table. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Zack Fadem Wells Fargo. Zack Fadem : To clarify on the tariffs on appliance prices in the quarter, it looks the category was up 10% in the U.S. but could you speak to the impact of pricing here versus unit sales? And with higher prices, have you seen any signs that demand could be softening or perhaps behavior is changing in favor of trade down in the category, anything like that? Hubert Joly : We\u2019re of course very pleased to report, I think it\u2019s the 31 consecutive quarter of positive comps in appliances. We believe that the low double digits comparable reporting represents another market share gain in the category. It is true that in certain sub-segments, longer in particular, this is where you\u2019ve seen the price increase. And so, -- but it\u2019s -- appliance -- it\u2019s about a quarter maybe of the total category, so it\u2019s not the end of the world. In terms of macro factors which is your question with what\u2019s happening in the housing and so forth, appliances are driven by new housing but also renovations and moves and so forth. So, we\u2019re watching the sector, but we\u2019re also watching the fact that as we discussed in previous quarters there is a significant change in the competitive landscape and significant tailwind from the competitive situation. And so, we believe revenue growth is principally driven by the continued strength in the category because it\u2019s fluctuate -- positive category. And the market share gains which themselves are driven by the competitive situation and the continued improvements we\u2019ve made in proficiency, the specialty labor investments we\u2019ve made, the supply chain investments we\u2019ve made and so forth. So, we continue to be upbeat and positive around this category as we move forward. We have talked about in addition to this, during Investor Day, about the favorable demographic aspects with the millennials finally leaving their parent\u2019s house and which leads them have to invest in all of the shiny objects we sell in our stores appliances and others as well. We continue to monitor this, but this is what we see at this point. Zack Fadem : Thanks, Hubert. That\u2019s helpful. And with the national Total Tech rollout, could you speak to how your initial customer adoption trends compare to your test markets? And for the pilot markets where you\u2019ve now been there for more than a year, could you also comment on what you\u2019re seeing on the renewal rates there, and if you\u2019re seeing any easing of the initial gross margin pressure? Thanks. Hubert Joly : So, the sales activities are very consistent with the pilots in the U.S., even though of course during the pilots, we had a whole range of options, we were testing, but at the highest level, it\u2019s very consistent. In terms of the renewal rate, the pilot is not truly indicative at this point, because we did not have credit card on file as an option when we were initially piloting and we rolled this out as part of the national expansion. So, we\u2019re going to have to wait for longer to have the read of that. And I think as I said in the prepared remarks, the impact on gross profit is very much in line with the expectations we had indicated when we launched this. And the situation is different from that we have seen in Canada. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Greg Melich with MoffettNathanson. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. I have really one follow-up question and then one will little longer term. So, the longer term one I would say is about the cash flow. I think, Corie, you mentioned cash will be used for the acquisition. As you\u2019re thinking about next year, now that we\u2019re -- lots changes since the Analyst Day, how much cash do you want to run the business and how you\u2019re thinking about the dividend versus buyback structure and leverage ratio going into next year? Corie Barry : Yes. So, obviously, I\u2019m not going guide at this point an exact cash balance. But, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve been working that cash balance down here over the last couple of years, in particular with some of the more aggressive buybacks and dividends. We\u2019re not going to guide next year at this point. We\u2019ll do that as we head in. But you can see that and especially us using cash on hand as well as for the acquisition of GreatCall that we continue to work that down to a place that we feel is not just suitable to run the business but suitable to help us in any large kinds of unexpected risk. And we\u2019ll continue to work that down. As it relates to our capital allocation strategy, we\u2019ve stayed very consistent with that, not just at Investor Day but prior to that where we\u2019ve said priority one is to invest in the business, whether that\u2019s in a form of the capital we\u2019re using internally or whether that\u2019s in the form of an acquisition like GreatCall. After that, the next priority being a premium dividend payer for our shareholders, and then finally returning excess cash through share repurchases. And that remains our strategy going forward. And we\u2019ll provide more clarity on exactly what that means for next year as we head in. Greg Melich : Got it. And then, the follow-up is just to understand the comp a little better, the make-up of it, there has been a lot of talk of pricing and tariffs et cetera. Could you help us understand, of that 6% comp, how much would have been ticket growth as opposed to number of transactions, just maybe a mix or a balance of it? Corie Barry : So, in the comps -- let me just take a big step back, broadly across our channels, what we saw was actually increases in traffic, increases in our transactions and increases in our close rate or our conversion if you think about it that way. So, when we meld all our channels together, and that\u2019s what\u2019s most important to us, that\u2019s what we saw across everything. And that\u2019s been a relatively consistent as we\u2019ve had last few quarters here. In terms specifically of tariffs, the super minimal at this point is you\u2019re basically talking about laundry where they\u2019ve been impacted or a few smaller categories. So, it\u2019s a tiny little slice; that is not going to be the driver at this point. More so, what we\u2019re excited about is that the underlying drivers across the channel have remained pretty consistent with good traffic, good conversion and therefore very nice transaction growth. Operator : And our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : Good morning and congrats on another very strong quarter against a very tough comparison. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Anthony Chukumba : I wanted to just quickly touch based on the GreatCall acquisition. You mentioned some of the different opportunities to scale the business and engrave the business. I guess, I was wondering about Assured Living from two perspectives. One, how did your experience with Assured Living sort of informed the GreatCall acquisition? In other words, I would have seen that maybe you\u2019re happy with the results of the Assured Living and that\u2019s why you started to do the GreatCall acquisition. And then, two, how are you planning to integrate, if at all GreatCall with Assured Living? Thank you. Hubert Joly : Let me start with the second part. We will be initially running GreatCall as a separate entity because it is a different business. We will be -- and we\u2019ve studied -- we have a number of, as you would expect, integration task forces, pursuing targeted value creation opportunities, in particular related to selling the existing products, like Jitterbug phones more aggressively, if I can put it this way, it\u2019s been in our stores for a long way but we both GreatCall and Best Buy teams feel, there is more that we can do there. So, it\u2019s going to be a separate business with targeted points of integration, targeted value creation opportunities. Most of GreatCall\u2019s business today in these consumer products. They have a small but promising business that\u2019s another good Assured Living. And across both Assured Living and GreatCall, we believe we have a -- there is an exciting opportunity in this idea of monitoring the behaviors in health of seniors in their homes with potentially very significant benefit of course for the aging seniors, their caregivers as well as the payers and providers. Today, in both cases, this is a small business. We think the potential is material, which rests in part on the ability to demonstrate the solution as a material benefit, as I indicated. And we\u2019re going to be working together to see we go after this market. So, think in this area, small parallel tracks with a big opportunity down the road. Anthony Chukumba : Got it. And so, just one, not even a related follow-up question but just more of a comment. I\u2019m really glad to hear about Minnesota [indiscernible] but you\u2019re not going to give away all your market share to the mass market. So, good to hear. Hubert Joly : How is that coming from a Frenchman who\u2019s been in Minnesota for 10 years, I\u2019m learning still the local practices. Operator : And our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, I just wanted to follow up a little on the growth in the home theater. So, as commented, it was a nice pickup, particularly in units. I guess, what\u2019s driving it? Is it interest in OLED, or HDR, continued trade up or something else that\u2019s caused the pickup? Corie Barry : Yes. I think you\u2019ve got a couple of things going on. And we\u2019ve been talking about them for a while. I think speed of adoption has increased. And so, it\u2019s a combination of larger screen sizes, so the idea of more fits in the home and you have the very nice form factor that\u2019s coming with new TVs. And then secondarily, those being coupled with higher technologies, 4K, HDR, particularly in those spaces incredibly available now. And I think those two combined with price points now that have come down to a range that feels like more and more people are ready for adoption here. I think you just hit a bit of the sweet spot between those things. And again, it\u2019s part of why we said we feel uniquely well positioned, because when those become some of the important pieces, being able to see it and be able to really have a line of sight to how this will look in my home and exactly what technology I\u2019m buying is pretty important. But I think you just have this real sweet spot now between lot more size for the money, a great technology that fits behind it, things more 4K, HDR kind of technologies and at a price point that makes sense for my budget. Curtis Nagle : Okay. That makes sense. And then, just a quick follow-up. Forgive me, if you gave this out already. But, what\u2019s the expectation for the free cash flow for the year? Corie Barry : We haven\u2019t guided free cash flow specifically. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re kind of just updating you each quarter they come. But where we are now right now is exactly where we had expected to be at this point in the year. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our last question from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Good quarter, guys. One, to just dig into the In-Home Advisor a little bit. You clearly ramped that up. Could you give us an update, if that\u2019s starting to move the needle on the same store sales, now that you\u2019re annualizing that rollout? And as a follow on, are there any categories where IHA is over-indexing to that that would might be able to see some of the outperformance working? Corie Barry : Yes. Peter, we -- as you said, we continue to expand our IHA program and have done that as we said we always would, in line with the demand that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. Obviously, we\u2019re not going to give out exactly about the revenue associated with IHAs. But, you can be rest assured that it was both part of how we guided and part of over-achingly where we\u2019re seeing strength in the business. In terms of categories where we tend to see strength, as we talked about before, home theater is a very nice lead into things that you want to do in your homes. But, we\u2019ve also seen some nice strength in what I\u2019ll call, broadly, smart home and networking, this idea that somebody can come in and help me figure out how these things work together, as well as a better foray into some of the appliance space where I can actually have someone physically help me walk through. And one of the hardest things about appliances is to figure out how to measure them. And so, when you have someone who is there to help you with what\u2019s to have, what\u2019s not, what exactly am I trying to get in the space, we\u2019ve also found that to be helpful. So, those -- as you would expect, those tend to be the leading categories. And now, we\u2019re just starting to get our arms around and building on a great feel for yet is as you use those as kind of your foray or your first run categories than what do you see over time in some of those more secondary categories. And we\u2019re still, like I said, learning in that space, but we like that. It\u2019s stretching across the home into a few of the different rooms and capabilities. Hubert Joly : Very good. As we conclude this call, I want to thank you for your continued interest in your work on Company. And of course we have immense appreciation for the Best Buy teams across the business for what they do for customers and for our shareholders every day. You all have a great day. Thank you. Operator : And that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I will begin today with a review of our third quarter performance, provide an update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020 : Building the New Blue strategy and share our excitements for the holiday season. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our outlook for the fourth quarter. In summary, team just delivered another strong quarter and we continued to make progress in the implementation of our strategy. We are excited about our continued momentum and the opportunities we have ahead of us. So, specifically, in the third quarter, we grew enterprise comparable sales by 4.3% on top of 4.4% last year, and we delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.93, which is up 19% compared to last year. We also continued to enhance the experience we provide to our customers across the many ways they interact with us. Our top-line performance was driven by positive comparable sales across all channels, geographies and most product categories. Similar to the first half of the year, our strong revenue growth in the quarter was helped by favorable environment and driven by how customers are responding to the unique and elevated experience we are building. Our Non-GAAP earnings per share outperformance was driven by a better than expected gross margin rate and helped by a lower than expected tax rates. And I wanted to thank our associates across the Company for their hard work and dedication, in delivering these great results. I am equally appreciative of their passionate focus on implementing our Best Buy 2020 strategy and on continuing to build the Company that has a unique, competitive positioning and a strong human, purposeful culture. Let me start with how we are expanding what we do for our customers. Last month, we completed the acquisition of GreatCall, a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers. GreatCall\u2019s life in its new home is off to a great start. We are working together to bring existing solutions to more customers and help fuel future growth in both the consumer and commercial markets. As such, and as a first step, we\u2019ve recently rolled out new dedicated endcaps in our mobile department that showcase GreatCall\u2019s easy-to-use mobile phone products and connected devices that are tailored for seniors and come with a range of relevant services. For example, with GreatCall\u2019s five-star service through a simple one-touch connection, customers can talk to U.S.-based especially trained agents who can connect them to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel. Beyond this, we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us to help aging consumers live longer in their homes with the use of technology, something that can provide significant benefits for the seniors and their families as well as for payers and providers. During the third quarter, we also continued to see encouraging results from our Total Tech Support program that we rolled out nationally in May. Customer signups as well as fulfillment costs are tracking in line with our expectations. Having a service that provides unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology, no matter where or when they bought is a compelling and unique value proposition for our members. In addition, discounts on installations, protection and in-home services provide customers with another reason to grow their relationship with Best Buy. Let me now say a few words about how we are evolving and how we sell. During the quarter, we expanded our free in-home advisor consultation program to approximately 530 advisors compared to 300 at the nationwide launch a year ago. We are pleased by both the ongoing customer demand and the fact that the performance of the program continues to track in line with our expectations. As expected, it is proving out to be an important part of our strategy to build deeper and more relationship-based experiences with our customers. We are continuing to invest in customer experience enhancements. So, for example, we just rolled out the ability for our customers to make an appointment with an advisor while they are still in our stores, rather than leaving the store and waiting for us to call and schedule an appointment. Regarding our efforts to improve the multi-channel shopping experience, we\u2019re especially excited about the ways in which we are making it easier for our customers to use the Best Buy app to shop online and in our stores. Let me give you a few examples. Frequently, we see customers in-store trying to compare multiple products to one another including specs, price, reviews or features. With the Best Buy app, they can now use their phone to scan products and use an in-app feature to easily compare the results. If they want, they can saves these results for later, if they\u2019re still researching a purchase. We also recently launched a new functionality that makes it much easier for customers to find open box items both online and in-store. In addition to increasing the use -- the ease of shopping, this feature raises customer confidence in purchasing these types of products by being more clear about the meaning of different condition categories, as well as the eligibility of any existing manufacturer\u2019s warranty or Geek Squad protection. The app also makes it easier for customers to determine whether a given product is currently available in the local store. Taking it one step further, we just launched a feature that can notify a customer, if a product in their online cart is currently available in the store they are in. This is helpful because customers often use the online cart as a way of keeping track of products they\u2019re interested in. In fact, 72% of customers who use the app come into one of our stores with an item already in their cart and we now have the ability to tell them in the moment that the product is available for purchase. The last example is one of our customers\u2019 favorites. We call it the On My Way feature, which allows customers buying large items to use the app to tell their local store that they are on their way to pick up their purchase. This message allows our Blue Shirt to have the item ready for pickup at the front of the store, making the in-store pickup experience faster and more pleasant for the customer. These innovations along with the dozens we\u2019ve rolled out in recent quarters, continue to blur the lines between online and physical shopping. This is increasingly how our customers want to shop, and our innovation pipeline closely mirrors and enables this changing behavior. Consequently, our in-app conversion rate is up and the usage of the Best Buy app by customers while they are in our stores has increased significantly. In Q3, we continued focus on driving productivity and cost takeout to help offset investments and pressures in the business. We achieved approximately $90 million in additional annualized cost reductions bringing the cumulative total to $465 million since Q2 of fiscal 2018 towards our goal of fiscal \u201821 goal of $600 million. As we\u2019ve discussed, we are investing in a range of enablers that are necessary to execute our Best Buy 2020 strategy. Most of them are multi-year investments in areas such as specialty labor, enterprise customer relationship management, knowledge management capabilities, our services platform and our supply chain. We\u2019re tracking according to plan on our investments, and we are pleased to see how they are beginning to return. So, for example, in supply chain, we\u2019ve seen our net promoter score for metro home delivery of large appliances and TVs increase more than 1,700 basis points over the last two years. This is due to investments in things like new metro delivery pads, located close to customers as well as a 60% increase in our distribution center square footage, which significantly decreases the reliance on outside space, and increases efficiency and accuracy. We have been a pioneer in fast and free delivery, and we continue to invest in our capabilities, because we know how important speed is to our customers. So, in Q3, we delivered about 80% of small packages in two days and almost a third were delivered next day, a third were delivered next day for free and with no membership fee required. We have also been one of the leaders in buy online and pickup in store, even with all of the great shipping options. Many customers find significant value in picking up their purchases in our stores whether it is because they want it right away or simply want to control the timing. In fact, we have seen seven straight quarters of growth for in-store pick-up as a percentage of online sales and more than 40% of our online revenue is now picked up in our stores. We are continuing to invest in labor. We\u2019re investing in specialty labor in areas such as in-home advisor, appliances and smart home. And we are also investing in compensation and benefit of our associates. Two things I want to highlight. Number one, because of the investments we\u2019ve made, we are competitive in the marketplace. In fact, our employee turnover rate in stores has been materially reduced over the last couple of years and is now in the low-30%. Second, the current industry trends we are all seeing are relatively in line with the expectations we had when we addressed the topic of wage pressure at our Investor Day last year. Our strategy here has been to approach the topic holistically. While starting base pay is of course important, we always look at creating an attractive overall employee value proposition including hourly wages, incentives for both full-time and part-time associates, employee benefits, skill developments, career advancement, and importantly, a purposeful human culture. And on the topic of benefits, we are excited about some of the unique benefits we offer to our employees including the employee discount on all of the cool stuff we are selling and tuition reimbursement, as well as four newly announced benefits including paid caregiver leave, backup child care, paid time off for part-time employees and enhanced mental health resources. Staying on the topic of people, I am excited to share that during the quarter, we promoted two key leaders to new and expanded roles in support of our Best Buy 2020 strategy and to help us accelerate our progress. So, first, Corie Barry, our Chief Financial Officer has been promoted to Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Transformation and Finance Officer responsible for orchestrating our transformation. In addition to finance, Corie now oversees our strategic growth office, our health business, a newly created transformation team in our digital and technology organization. All of you know Corie of course, and the strong skills and experience she brings to this expanded role. This focus on transformation underscores the major pivot we\u2019re making as an organization with our Best Buy 2020 strategy as we are moving from a transaction to a relationship orientation and evolving from a product to a need-based solution orientation. Second, Mike Mohan has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer of our U.S. business, responsible for running the domestic business and in partnership with Corie, getting us to where we want to be as a company. As you know, Mike has been with Best Buy since 2004 and has been responsible for our merchandising, marketing and supply chain functions. He now has added all the channels including online, in-store and home, and our services teams to his scope. Over the last several years, Mike has demonstrated his ability to lead and drive changing ways of large and complex business. I am personally very excited to work with Corie and Mike in this new construct and to continue to work with our team on our strategy and our growth plans and on continuing to strengthen our culture. I could not be more inspired by the opportunities ahead of us as we implement our Best Buy 2020\u2019s Building the New Blue strategy. And I know that you will want to join me in congratulating Corie and Mike for their new expanded responsibilities. Looking immediately ahead, we are excited about our holiday plans and everything we have to offer our customers this holiday season. What matters of course during holiday includes assortments, deals, product availability, help, convenience and speed. And our team has put together a best-in-class assortment, prepared an amazing set of deals and ensured we have great inventory availability across other product categories we carry. This makes us a natural destination for everything tech related including TVs, computing, gaming, a growing toy assortment, phones, smart home devices, and large and small appliances. We released our Black Friday ad two weeks ago with 52 pages of the best deals of the holiday to help our customers find the best deals for their friends and families.  Notably, this will be our first holiday with Total Tech Support and we excited to offer it to customers as a giftable item. This is the number one thing our retail teams have been asking for since the launch of Total Tech Support last May. It is a great way for gift givers to ensure the technology they\u2019re giving to their loved ones, will be set up and working as it should be. Once again, this year, we offer our customers compelling delivery options such as free shipping on everything all season long, fast in-store pickup that can be ready in one hour, and same day and next day delivery options. We also materially upgraded our online gift center and our new gift finder will make it easier to get just the right gifts for kids, teens, parents, grandparents, significant others and families. For customers in our stores, our Blue Shirt Associates, Geek Squad agents and in-home advisors are ready to help our customers find great gifts and solutions. Whether you\u2019re shopping digitally or in our stores, Best Buy can help customers find gifts for everyone on their gift list. Now, beyond holiday, we continue to be excited by the opportunities that exist for us in the marketplace. We like the continued rate of technology innovation and the capabilities technology can bring to people\u2019s lives. We like our opportunity to offer customers a more consultative approach to truly address their needs, provide them an increasing range of services and solutions, expand our relationship with them and become a bigger part of their lives. And we particularly like the opportunities we have in the connected health space following the acquisition of GreatCall. Before I turn the call over to Corie to review the results and our outlook, I\u2019d like to share some key facts and thoughts on the subject of tariffs. We estimate that the latest $200 billion list, the 22 affecting September touches only about 7% or about $2.3 billion of our total cost of goods sold, and many of the products on this list are accessories. The expected impact of tariffs on our business for the remainder of this fiscal year is reflected in our guidance and is expected to be minimal. The reasons why it is expected to be minimal that the tariffs only impact a very small portion of our business, the current rate is only 10% and their costs are being mitigated in a variety of ways. Looking into next year, I would say three things today. One, as you know, this is a dynamic situation with the expectation as of now that the tariff on the current list increases to 25% on January 1st; two my personal view is that while the journey may not be linear, the trade negotiations with China will progress; three, we believe that working together, vendors and our team, have at their disposal a range of effective ways to mitigate the effects of tariffs which is precisely what we are working on. And we\u2019ll of course continue to update you on this matter. So, in conclusion, we are, as you can tell, energized by our continued momentum and overall performance and encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making in implementing Best Buy 2020 : Building the New Blue strategy. We see significant value generation opportunity ahead of us by successfully enriching lives with technology and providing services and solutions that solve real customer needs. And so, lastly, I want to extend my sincere appreciation to our associates for everything they are doing for customers this holiday season. You are amazing. Thank you for what you do. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Corie for more details on our Q3 performance and our Q4 guidance. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $9.6 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93, both of which exceeded our expectations. We saw better-than-expected top-line results in our mobile phones, gaming and wearables categories. Our operating income rate was at the high end of our expectations, driven by a slightly favorable gross profit rate. Compared to the guidance we provided last quarter, a lower than expected tax rate provided a $0.03 benefit that was partially offset by the impact of Hurricane Florence and Michael, which had a negative impact of approximately $0.02 with only a minor impact on revenue. Consistent with last year, we made decisions to support our employees, our customers and our communities by continuing to pay our employees who performed volunteer work, while their store was closed. These efforts come at a cost but they are the right things to do. Additionally, the inclusion of GreatCall had a negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share, which was not included in the guidance we provided last quarter. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 2.9% to $9.6 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 4.3%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.15 or $0.19 to $0.93. This increase was primarily driven by a $0.09 per share benefit driven by a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate and an $0.08 per share benefit from the net share count change. Our Q3 operating income rate was higher than expected but still lower than last year, as expected, due mainly to higher supply chain costs and the rollout of our Total Tech Support program. Our comparable sales growth of 4.3% included a negative 70 basis-point impact from the calendar shift. As we have discussed in previous quarters, our reported comparable sales are computed on like-for-like fiscal weeks and are not shifted to more closely aligned calendar weeks, following last year\u2019s 53-week year. As we shared with you last quarter, in Q4, we expect the calendar shift to have a positive impact of approximately 50 basis points on our reported comparable sales. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 3.1% to $8.8 billion. This increase was primarily driven by a comparable sales increase of 4.3%, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 287 Best Buy Mobile and 19 large-format store closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were mobile phones, gaming, appliances, wearables, headphones, and smartphones. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our tablet category. Domestic online revenue of $1.21 billion was 13.8% of domestic revenue compared to 12.7% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 12.6% on top of 22.3% growth in the third quarter of last year, primarily driven by higher conversion and increased traffic. In our international segment, revenue increased 0.6% to $834 million. This was primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 3.7% driven by both, Canada and Mexico, and incremental revenue associated with 6 new large format store openings in Mexico over the past year. Partially offsetting these gains was approximate 460 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit, the enterprise gross profit rate decreased 30 basis points to 24.2%. The domestic gross profit rate was 24.4% versus 24.7% last year. The rate decline of approximately 30 basis points was driven primarily by higher supply chain costs from both, investments and higher transportation expense as well as the national rollout of our Total Tech Support offer. Both of these were in line with the expectations we shared last quarter of approximately 50 basis points of combined pressure. These pressures were partially offset by higher overall product margin rates, which included the benefit from our gross profit optimization initiative. The international gross profit rate of 22.2% was flat to last year. Now, turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.98 billion or 20.7% of revenue which increased $52 million and was flat to last year as a percentage of revenue. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.81 billion or 20.6% of revenue versus $1.75 billion or 20.6% of revenue last year. The $55 million increase was primarily due to one, growth investments, which includes specialty labor and higher depreciation expense; two, higher incentive compensation; three, GreatCall operating expenses; and four, higher variable costs due to increased revenue. These increases were partially offset by cost reductions. International SG&A was $178 million or 21.3% of revenue versus $181 million or 21.8% of revenue last year. The $3 million decrease was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, SG&A increased $5 million. The increase was primarily driven by new stores opened in Mexico in the past year and higher depreciation expense in Canada. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate decreased to 22.7% from 30.4% last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rates as a result of tax reform. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the third quarter in line with our expectations. We returned $493 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. In Q3, we completed a public bond offering for $500 million and 4.45% notes due in October 2028. The net proceeds from the sale will be used for general corporate purposes and replaced the $500 million and 5% notes that matured and were retired earlier this year during our second fiscal quarter. Our acquisition of GreatCall for $792 million in net cash consideration was funded with existing cash and is not expected to impact our previously communicated plan to spend $1.5 billion on share repurchases this fiscal year. Finally, our ending inventory balance increased 23% and our accounts payable increased 21% compared to the third quarter of last year. These increases were primarily due to the calendar shift this year, which results in Q3 ending a week closer to the holiday season. On a like-for-like calendar basis, our Q3 ending inventory balance increased approximately 7%, which was slightly higher than expectation we provided last quarter. This was due to decisions we made to bring in receipts early in response to pressure within the international and domestic transportation industry due primarily to tariffs and weather as well as some product launch timing shifts. Overall, I am very pleased with the health of our inventory. I would now like to talk about our guidance. We are raising our full year guidance for revenue and EPS to reflect the outperformance in the third quarter. For Q4, our guidance is consistent with the expectations that were implied in the guidance provided on our last call. This is despite approximately $0.04 of negative impact that was not contemplated on our Q2 call from GreatCall and a lower profit share benefit from our services plan portfolio that originally expected. As a reminder, the extra week in the fourth quarter of last year added approximately $760 million in revenue and approximately $0.20 of earnings per share. Our Q4 outlook is as follows : Enterprise revenue in the range of $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion; comparable sales growth of flat to up 3%; domestic comparable sales growth of flat to up 3% and international comparable sales growth of flat to up 3%; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.48 to $2.58; our Non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; and our diluted weighted average share count of approximately 275 million shares. A few additional comments on the fourth quarter guidance. As I mentioned earlier, the calendar shift is estimated to be a benefit to Q4 domestic comparable sales of approximately 50 basis points. We expect to see a flattish gross profit rate compared to last year as approximately 25 basis points of supply chain pressure and a $50 million lower profit sharing benefit are partially offset by slightly better year-over-year merchandise margins, including the impact from gross profit optimization initiative and the impact of GreatCall. The $50 million negative impact from the lower profit share payment is $10 million higher than what we guided last quarter. We expect our SG&A dollars to decline in the low-single digits due to the extra week last year and lower short-term incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of GreatCall\u2019s operating expenses. Our full-year guidance now stands at : Enterprise revenue in the range of $42.5 billion to $42.9 billion; enterprise comparable sales increase of 4% to 5%; non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.5%, which is flat to fiscal 2018\u2019s rate on a 52-week basis; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $5.09 to $5.19, an increase of 15% to 17%, this represents an increase of 21% to 23% when compared to fiscal 2018 on a 52-week basis; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24%; and capital expenditures of approximately $800 million to $850 million. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kate McShane with Citi. Kate McShane : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One of the statistics that you put in your prepared comments was that more of your product is being picked up in-store, and I know that\u2019s been a big initiative for you guys and a lot of retailers. So, as you leverage the store and as customers come to pick up their products, I just wondered if you could walk us through how that contributes to the overall profitability and how we can expect that contributing going forward. Corie Barry : Yes, Kate. That has been a trend that we\u2019ve been seeing. And one of the things we\u2019ve actually talked about, because the other kind of flavor on this question is, how do you think about the difference in profitability between the various channels and how is that evolving over time. And, we\u2019ve talked a lot about, in our business, what we actually see as less difference between the profitability in the channels always with the caveat that things like this exactly make it very hard for us to pull the channels apart. But, this is part of the reason that the overall profitability of our online channel in particular has continued to improve over time. And it\u2019s a combination of both experiences on the site, but also ways in which the customer\u2019s choosing to come pick up their own merchandise versus necessarily wanting to shift straight to their home in every instance. So, this is definitely part of when we talk about the lesser difference between the profitability of our channels. This is a big part of what has helped us create a more robust online profitability profile. Kate McShane : And if I can ask one other unrelated question just about GreatCall. I know it\u2019s early days, only been a couple of weeks. But, I just wondered if there have been any early learnings since it\u2019s been part of your portfolio and how we should think about your strategy with regards to M&A going forward? Hubert Joly : Any early warnings? Kate McShane : Learnings. Hubert Joly : Oh, learnings, yes. Thank you, Kate. So, yes, we are very excited about the GreatCall acquisition. It\u2019s completely in line with our strategy of addressing key human needs. The company we acquired, I have to commend our team for the extensive due-diligence we did, in particular, ensuring the cultural fit. When we acquire a small company, it\u2019s really important that -- and the alignment of missions is really very, very strong. So, all of the -- lesson for us maybe Kate -- because we\u2019ve not done acquisitions in a long time, was all of the pre-signing and pre-closing preparation to ensure a very smooth integration has been very positive. The other lesson for us is that the opportunities for us to help aging seniors stay in their home longer through technology, we are more excited than ever about this. And sometimes, you wake up after an acquisition, oh, my God what have we done? No, we feel very, very positive about this. And we\u2019ve said in capital allocation strategy that our priority was to invest the cash flow in improving the business both organically and inorganically. And this gives us -- we\u2019re paying a lot of attention to this first acquisition because success there of course increases our confidence to do more. And so, our level of excitement is very good. And I want to take the opportunity to salute anybody from GreatCall listening, they\u2019re great member of our team, teams are working really well together, so feel very good. Corie, anything you would add? Corie Barry : I would just add one more financial clarifier, so that it doesn\u2019t send unintended messages. We are very excited about working with the team. We do still expect the impact to be -- of the acquisition to be neutral on a 12-month basis. But you heard me call out a couple impacts here in Q3 and Q4. Those are more about the early part of the business. One, we have some revised opening balance sheet assumptions, which can happen anytime you have an acquisition like this. And then, two, we're accelerating some of the customer acquisition costs which is what I'm going to call a high test problem, meaning we believe some of the things we can do together, means we can acquire more customer here early in our life together, and that obviously pays dividend overtime as that customer is on their plan and is a customer with us hopefully for life. So, I just want to make sure people understand that's not that that business is performing differently than we thought, it's just a bit of how it timed out amongst the quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Good morning. Congratulations, Corie and Mike on the promotion. My first question is on the zero to 3 guide for Q4. I think Corie, you suggested the same on the Q3 call. The consumer seems fine, and Hubert reiterated the favorable backdrop. What's changed a little, at least since then is you had some competitor actions maybe around shipping and then Amazon apparently will have some product they didn't have. And I'm sure you\u2019ve factored competition in, but I was curious if anything surprised you sort of from when you sort of started thinking about the zero to 3 to now? Corie Barry : Not so much the price. I mean, look, the consumer and competitive environment this time of the year in particular is always evolving. And it's one of the things that we actually talk about pretty often how the behavior even of the consumer, how we think about the marketplace in Q4 is a little bit different than how we think about it for rest of the year. You're absolutely right and that we are doing everything we can to take into account both what we see in a consumer and a competitive positioning as we think about Q4. And yes, there have been changes, but at the same time, we continue to accelerate some of our own strategic advantages and continue to feel very well placed in the marketplace. And maybe Hubert can hum a few bars on how we're also thinking about even with our own Apple business and the things we do with our Apple products that a little bit [indiscernible] Amazon? Hubert Joly : Yes. We\u2019ve -- as you know -- thank you for the congratulations to my two colleagues and sharing the excitement. We've had a longstanding relationship with Amazon -- with Amazon and Apple, of course. We\u2019ve built over the years a very unique experience setting Apple pricing. Apple would say that Best Buy provides the best retail experience for their products and services outside of their own home. As you know, we have 900 Apple stores within our stores and they do a great job of showcasing the products and services. We have 3,000 Apple ecosystem experts in our stores that includes AppleMasters and sales consultants and agents and Apple employees. And the online experience we've built over the years, it's been years since we've been doing this, is -- from a service standpoint, I think we are the largest third-party [site] [ph] of Apple Care and the largest third-party authorized service provider for Apple products. So, our focus as a company has always been on the customer and building a unique customer experience. I think, the announcement pretending to Amazon -- Amazon has always been selling Apple products including first-party for the laptops and what not. Our understanding is that they will reduce massively the number of third-party sellers. And of course, they'll start selling the phones or the watch, themselves, but it\u2019s unclear at this point what the net effect is going to be. And our focus on continuing to enhance the customer experience work with our vendor partners, Apple is a key one on continue to innovate and make sure we have a competitive advantage in the marketplace. So, I think that the zero to 3% is probably -- it's in line with what we had said a quarter ago. I know, there\u2019s been a lot of noise in the media about a lot of things, but we\u2019re sticking to our perspective on Q4 and we\u2019re ready to serve every customer including you guys on the phone. Simeon Gutman : Thanks. My follow-up maybe for you Hubert. Just to drill down a bit on the mobile business. How do you sort of put a fortress around it? And then, can you share with us, like if you look at your Elite Plus customers, what percentage of them are buying mobile through Best Buy, just shopping the category, I\u2019m thinking like just as a phone as a primary purchase? Hubert Joly : So, Simeon, you said, build the mobile business -- fortress around the mobile business. Can you elaborate on your question a little bit, because we\u2019re not in the fortress building business? So, tell me more about your question. Simeon Gutman : Yes. Look, how do you keep that customer loyal to buying, upgrading their phone, renewing through Best Buy as the years go on? I think some customer survey research that we have from a couple years ago, which show that the captive as well as sort of the Apple Stores seem to be taking share as a whole. And so, now, there\u2019s some more competitive entrants, if you will, if Amazon does become a first party seller of the phone. So, how do you keep the customer there and just what is the importance of that customer to the business? Hubert Joly : Yes. I will start and then Mike, if you want to elaborate that will would great. We have been investing significantly in that part of the business, in our stores in particular through the initiative for Mobile 2020. And you have seen that in our stores. So, that\u2019s in partnership with the carriers. Buying a phone is actually a complex experience. And we do well, compared to other players, when the items that we\u2019re selling are either very large or complex to buy. So, that\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a strength. And so, we\u2019ve invested in systems to streamline the buying processing in the stores, making it shorter. We\u2019ve had these menu boards to make it clear for customers to know what the promotions were. Of course, the fact that we have Verizon, AT&T and Sprint in our stores is a unique advantage. We have increased labor and the proficiency of the associates, both our own associates and the carriers\u2019 associates. We have, of course, the display of the major brands of phones, Apple, Samsung, and increasingly Google. So, that\u2019s the unique experience. Now that being said, phones is now the category where we have the highest market share. So, there\u2019s a lot of options and the carriers. And Apple do have an advantage, but we feel good about our momentum and our continued investment in the customer experience. Mike, what did you add to this? Mike Mohan : Thanks, Hubert. Good to talk to you, Simeon. What I would add to complement what Hubert said is, our phone business is a complicated, so people want to think about their relationship with the carriers. And so, the one thing that Best Buy\u2019s done is try to simplify their experience, whether it\u2019s in our stores or online, when you can actually talk to a qualified expert, you can review your plan with us, we can compare plans to other carriers, we\u2019re very objective about that and you can compare an iOS ecosystem to an Android ecosystem. And we still believe even though the consumer is truly -- and you know the statistics probably better than I do around delaying or upgrade purchase, that means they\u2019re keeping their phone longer and they want to do other things with it. So, we are rolling out the amount of stores we can do Apple Glass repairing [ph] in this quarter as well. This is a key thing that consumers are going to need more help with as they keep their devices longer. So, I think we look at that as a stand for what we can do for customers that's different than an e-commerce only distribution avenue or even what Apple can handle on their own stores. Simeon Gutman : Great. Thanks. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joe Feldman : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the inventory, again. I know it sounds like it's in good shape and you guys did bring forward. What was causing the early receipts? Was it trying to get in front of like tariffs at the turn of the year or was it a logjam created by others related to tariffs, or can you share a little more color there? Corie Barry : Yes, absolutely. So, let me just try first part, I'm trying to make sure that I'm clear. Of 23% increase that we saw in inventory, about call it 16%, 17% of that was just due to the shift of the calendar weeks. So, literally, once you line up the calendar weeks to how much difference it makes, because you bring so much inventory in each week here. So, literally if I just line up the calendar weeks, that leads a 7% overall increase in inventory, first of all not that out of line with the sales happening [ph] out of the quarter. And then second of all, yes we have clearly made some proactive decisions. There has been more activity in especially the ports and some of the deconsolidation areas, both due to a lot of companies bringing more in due to tariffs but also even just some of the typhoons have caused some weather delays and things being more lumpy and spotty. And so, I give our inventory demand planning teams a ton of credit for working really hard to make sure that we were well prepared in phasing that inventory in early so that you would absolutely have it. I mean, one of that largest NPS drivers that we've had, continues to be inventory availability. And we felt like it is really important for us to have the stuff that people want as we bring it in. You can see it's all basically new and fresh given the corresponding increase in the payables balance as well. Joe Feldman : Thank you. And then, just a follow-up. As you think about the holidays and the season, obviously the promotions seem like they've started sooner or at least getting better sooner. Have you guys seen -- or can you comment on any response? I know it's a current quarter, but if there is any color you can give there, or asked another way, are there any particular catalysts that you're looking for this holiday season or any key products that you think might be the big winners for the season? Hubert Joly : There is such an amazing set of exciting products for the holiday. And that's one of the things that I'm excited about this category which is continued slow innovation. And what's great about this holiday is that the -- there is excitement across many, many different categories. So, gaming is going to be particularly hot. There is a number of great titles, the Nintendo, Super Smash Bros; Red Dead Redemption 2 and Call of Duty, Black Ops 4 TVs, I think continue to be a big item, people moving to larger screen and smart TVs. And of course we have a partnership with Amazon there with the Insignia and Toshiba 4K USB Fire TV additions. But broadly speaking, a lot of excitement around TVs, streaming devices, voice assistance with screen. So, screen is going to be a big item. If you bought a voice assistant last year, here is a good news; you can buy a new one with a screen. And I have a few on my kitchen table, lot of functionalities there. New phones, there has been a number of great new phones that have been launched health, both Fitbit and Apple. Appliances, lots of excitement, small appliances, great gifting items across mixers, pressure cookers, I don\u2019t cook, but I\u2019ve heard, right, [ph] major appliances. There is a lot of -- this is a more promotional time of the year for appliances than I think ever before -- and then security doorbells. So, there is a lot of excitement for people to come to our stores or shop online with us or again, we\u2019ll come to you. So, that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re excited about this holiday, of course there is the general consumer confidence, but there\u2019s a lot of reasons. And we can take care of your entire list. So, just one trip and you\u2019re done. Corie Barry : Joe, specific to your question around -- just so I make sure we hit it on the competitive environment. I mean, I think the earlier, earlier start to the season is definitely phenomenon that we\u2019ve been seeing over the last few years; it\u2019s something we have taken into account in our own competitive positioning and in our own promotional cadences is reflected in as best we could, guidance that we give you for Q4. And so, we always talk about how this -- the holiday continues to change, it continues to shape differently, and we continue to have a team that does this -- an amazing amount of work to make sure we feel really prepared to compete as that holiday season continues to evolve. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : First off, congrats to Corie and Mike in your new responsibilities. Corie Barry : Thank you Brian Nagel : So, with regard to the buy online pick-up in store, in your prepared comments, you talked about this, the business -- that part of business continuing strengthen. The questions I have there are, one, is this something that Best Buy is doing what is Best Buy encouraging customers to or is it more of a reflection of the natural evolution of the online market? And then, as far as -- and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve looked at this, as a customer chooses to pick-up a product in store versus having it shipped to their homes, where is the benefit for -- how you look at the benefits for Best Buy? Is that the overall maybe better profitability or the add-on sales as that customer comes to the store? Hubert Joly : Yes. So, on the first point, yes, this is the customer choice. As a customer-focused, customer-obsessed company, we\u2019re not going to try to make the decision for the customer. So, if you look on our site or in the app, it\u2019s really the customers. There is no financial incentive one way or the other, it\u2019s really up to the customer. That\u2019s what we said in the prepared remarks. There is unique benefits of picking up in store. You can get it in less than an hour. So, speed is pretty crazy, knowing that 30% of the U.S. population lives within 15 minutes of a Best Buy store. And then, you could say, you don\u2019t want to control when you\u2019re going to get it -- by the way if it\u2019s a gift during holiday, you may not want to have the gift show up at your home and whatnot. So, it\u2019s really a customer-driven phenomenon. The benefits to Best Buy, of course, there\u2019s shipping, there is additional items, and we love to see the customers in our stores. And we can help them with any questions, they\u2019ll tend to buy more stuff as well, which we -- but this is not what is driving it. We want the customer to have the opportunity to choose and get the best possible experience. And on this topic, because we\u2019ve been doing this for so long, we\u2019ve had the opportunity to really improve the process, invest in the systems, invest in the labor, invest in the overall customer experience, and we\u2019re seeing good results. Corie or Mike, if you want to add? Corie Barry : No. That\u2019s okay. Brian Nagel : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Just one quick follow-up question. With regard to real estate, in your release, you mentioned, obviously we had the Best Buy Mobile stores closed and then some repositioning of your larger format stores too. Any thoughts on how we should expect that effort going forward -- or I guess, what you expect to see on the topic of real estate positioning going forward, repositioning. Corie Barry : We've been pretty consistent on our real estate positioning, which is we're lucky and that we get to see a number of leases every year, right now we're seeing about 130 leases per year. We're looking at all of those stores, and not just the stores, but importantly also the markets to try to understand how do we very best serve the consumers in those markets. And we continue to make sure we're making the best decisions for every market and therefore refining down the market positioning. But, I don't think you're going to see any massive speed up, you're not going to see a change in the overall positioning. You're just going to see us continue to make sure that we feel like the footprint by market reflects the needs of the consumers in that market. Brian Nagel : Alright. Thank you and best of luck for the holiday. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : Next question is from David Schick Consumer Edge Research. David Schick : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, there is always this tension of sort of looking in the near-term at what products or latest announcement, whether it's holiday or Apple, Amazon competitor announcement is going on, and then, there is a temptation to go back to product cycles that have been there historically and sort of thinking about your business. I guess, it would be helpful if you could talk about maybe neither of those, you've talked about services, but what other products? When you have these suite of products at the front of the store that are more discovery for consumers, how are those conversations going with vendors? What does that look like, what is front of your store, things we haven't seen yet, look like over the next several years? Mike Mohan : Hey, David, it's Mike. Good morning. That's a great question to talk about. The biggest evolution that you\u2019ve seen in our stores because I know you shop in them is trying to have people understand what our connected home or connected product ecosystem can do for them. And I think you're going to see that continue to evolve. We're just starting to scratch the surface around assistant, Digital Assistant technology, both with the screen, without a screen, people can think about personal security and as it morphs into what they think about their own version of health and wellness. So, what you do see at the front of our stores is an exciting amount of real estate. There is tremendous interest from both current vendors and those who are just starting to emerge to get a chance to be able to have -- leverage our team members and show customers what we truly can do and try to solve one of these lifestyle needs we spoke about them at our Investor Day, specifically around health and wellness, and security. And I think you're going to see more that as we move into the next few years. I don't know, Hubert, do you want to add anything? Hubert Joly : The other thing from equity story standpoint is that this discussion -- kind of a discussion around product cycles and specific categories and so forth. The way increasingly we look at it, and of course next year, we'll have opportunities to update you guys around targets and what not. But, the way we look at is in aggregate the different product categories we sell while within the portfolio there is cycles, as a whole it's a pretty stable basket of things that customers buy. And there is always innovation; you never know what's going to come to your genre, [ph] but there is always that. The growth opportunity for us is not driven specifically by a particular product launch; it's driven by the opportunity to stand a relationship with the customers. A key fact that I always go back to is that there our share of wallet of existing customers is 26%. And as we continue to build the customer experience and the ability to build relationship with customers, the growth opportunities from expanding this share of wallet, and imagine - this is not in updated forecast, but imagine the impact of growing to from a quarter to a third. And that\u2019s the opportunity, that\u2019s the obsession we have, and that goes through really understanding the customer needs, knowing the customer, bringing solutions, hardware services, and then being a part of their life. So, that\u2019s why in home advisor plays a key role; that\u2019s why Total Tech Support as a way to be in people\u2019s lives on an ongoing basis; that\u2019s getting into the house space gives us these opportunities. So, what\u2019s very exciting, if you look back at the last year or two is we\u2019ve now demonstrated the ability to grow the Company and comp ourselves. And the growth opportunity looking ahead is driven by this expansion of the customer relationship. It\u2019s going to take time, but it\u2019s a very, very exciting. David Schick : And is it fair to say this, there will be Best -- as it has been in the past, there will be Best Buy exclusive as part of what is present to the consumer? Mike Mohan : I think that will always be a fair assumption. We talk about our ability to making curated market and part of that is ensuring consumers know what the products will do and solution for them, and that provides us with a great opportunity to do that, David. Operator : Next question comes from Matthew McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock : Two quick questions. The first one, just Corie, you talked about a lot of investments that you\u2019re making, Hubert, you did as well. And you\u2019ve been making investments for 3, 4 plus years. I was wondering, as we look forward, what are the a bigger buckets of investments that need to be made in the business that could potentially wanted to flow through on earnings, thinking into 2019 and beyond? That would be my first question. Corie Barry : Yes. There\u2019s a few different suites of investments that are what I\u2019m going to call a little bit more ongoing in nature. And when we talked about it at Investor Day, we talked about it in both a larger slots of investments and pressures. And so, as you think about things like our ongoing investment in people, that come from both very specialized areas, like a smart home experience in our stores, or an in-home advisor experience. It\u2019s also come broadly from our investment in wages and in benefits and in the list of things that Hubert talked about that are important to our employees. That is a suite of investments that is ongoing, and we believe -- and that\u2019s why we talked about in terms of our longer range plan, that\u2019s going to continue to be a space where we invest. A second major area of ongoing investment is going to be what I will call our technology capabilities, or those tools that will help our associates and help our customers have better experiences, things like we talked about CRM, knowledge management, those are longer term builds, and we\u2019re going to continue to refine those and make those tools better and easier to use over time including the investments in the digital experiences that Hubert did a really nice job f outlining in his prepared remarks. And then three, we specifically said we were making a major investment in our supply chain infrastructure. And we were again very clear that that was going to be a multi-year journey for us as we worked on both the space required to facilitate our larger product, as well as the efficacy required to deliver at-speed on our smaller products. And that again is going to be a longer term journey for us. So, it\u2019s part of the reason we teed all of those up at Investor Day and said these are going to be the longer term investments and pressures and part of the reason we have remained so committed the cost reduction side of things as well. Matthew McClintock : And then, just my second question is on home theater. Hubert, you sounded really excited about the home theater options for the holiday, and the category ledger comp last quarter, but I didn\u2019t see it listed this quarter. So, I'm just trying to understand what happened to home theater this quarter? And as we go into holiday, you benefited a lot from a trade up to higher size, bigger TVs. Is there still room to increase the mix of bigger TVs in your sales mix to offset ASP pressure as we look at holidays? Thank you. Corie Barry : Now, there is always room to some bigger TVs. One of the -- we definitely saw a bit of moderation in the TV industry compared to what we saw in Q2. I\u2019d call a little bit more like what we saw in Q1. So, it slowed a bit. Good news is, units continued to be up at a pretty good clip; and what you would alluded to, ASPs down a bit. The nice part is we continue to see people mix into, specifically to your question, larger TVs. And we get really caught up in 4K and the technologies, but genuinely what people want is a larger great TV experience in their home. And we continue to see excitement around that which kind of props up this concept that this is in one of those cycles that automatically falls off the cliff. It is more -- this idea that we keep providing new and different ways for customers to get bigger TVs with better technologies. And so, yes, it moderated a bit from the last quarter, but it's clearly going to be a hot item heading into the holidays and we feel very well prepared. Matthew McClintock : It\u2019s -- sorry, go ahead, Hubert. Hubert Joly : I was wondering with Mollie, we have time for one more. So, I think we do, all right. Operator : Our last question will come from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Mike Baker : Hi. Thanks, guys. So, I guess, this would be a longer term question I suppose and I don't know if you're prepared to talk about this. But, relative to the analyst day that you just referenced, it looks to me as if you're going to come in, you're going to beat the sales plan of $43 billion because you're well on your way to hitting that this year, maybe a little bit below it, but by 2020, you should be there. Does that necessarily translate into that operating margins or should we still think about a similar operating margin to what you laid out few -- I guess last year? And if the mark is not going up, then why not? Corie Barry : So, for right now, what we're focused on is finishing out this year and making sure that we deliver on the commitments that we made for this year. We're absolutely going to update everyone as we get to the end of the fiscal year here on what we think our mid-term outlook looks out and how it should be updated. What I said on the call, and what we alluded to this idea of continuing to make sure we invest in the business in a way that we feel like it's going to set us up for future success remains our focus. And then, we'll help you through the future financial implications of that, once we get through the rest of this fiscal year. Mike Baker : I guess, as a follow-up I'd ask, the same store sales are going to end up being at least 4% for the second year in a row. How sustainable is that, how much of that is due to really strong products for the last couple of years that might not repeat and you need services to accelerate to replace some growth in products? Hubert Joly : So, I think that we\u2019re obviously excited about the fact that we've been able to demonstrate this very positive trend. As Corie said, we'll provide an update on our Q4 earnings call. And to the point of product cycles versus customer relationship, our main theme -- the big long-term opportunity for us is the expansion of the relationship with customers. We've demonstrated at Investor Day that the volatility in the sectors is actually much lower than people think. We like of course the environment in which we\u2019ve been operating this year and we\u2019ll provide the updates on the Q4 call, but very excited about the future for our business. So, with this, maybe I\u2019d like to wrap. I know, this is an incredibly busy day for all of you. We were not apparently the only retailer reporting today, to say the least. So, thank you so much for your attention. I want to say one word because I\u2019m sure many of those friends and family in California that are impacted by the fire, so our heart is with the population in both Northern and Southern California. We wish all of you a very safe and very happy holiday. And I know one way to increase your happiness, which is to focus your list with us. So, look forward to seeing you in our stores or online. Thank you so much for your attention and look forward to catching up with you in three months. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, everyone. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy's Q4 2019 Fiscal Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1 :00 P.M. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien: Thank you and good morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO; and Corie Barry, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful, can be found in this morning's earning release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we'll make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. As a reminder, the fourth quarter we are reporting today includes 13 weeks compared to last year's 14 week quarter. We estimate the extra week last year was approximately $760 million in revenue and approximately $0.20 of non-GAAP diluted EPS. Last year's extra week is excluded from our comparable sales calculations. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us. I will begin today with a review of our fourth quarter and our fiscal 2019 annual performance, will provide an update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020, building the New Blue strategy. And I will discuss our priorities for fiscal 2020. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our quarterly results and our financial outlook. But first, we are very proud of the financial results we've just delivered. In the fourth quarter we grew our Enterprise comparable sales by 3%, which is on top of 9% last year. We also expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 30 basis points and delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.72, which is up 23% compared to last year excluding the extra week on a reported basis. Including last year's extra week, our non-GAAP EPS was up 12%. On a full year basis, we grew our Enterprise comparable sales by 4.8% on top of 5.6% in fiscal 2018. This is the best two year stacked comparable sales in 14 years. We expanded our operating income rate approximately 10 basis points and grew our non-GAAP EPS by 26% on a 52 week comparable basis. I note that with the annual revenue of $42.9 billion and non-GAAP operating income of $2 billion we just delivered, we essentially met our fiscal 2021 target provided at our Investor Day in 2017, two years earlier than we said we would. From a capital allocation standpoint, we returned $2 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And our non-GAAP return on invested capital now stands at 25.8% indicating that our formula of investments in our future, revenue growth and cost takeout is producing very attractive returns. In addition to these strong financial results, during fiscal 2019, we also made significant progress implementing our Best Buy 2020 strategy to enrich lives through technology and further develop our competitive differentiation. Let me provide some highlights starting with our customers. Our customers are noticing the improved experience we provide them as they interact with us digitally, in stores or in their homes. For the year, our Net Promoter Score increased more than 300 basis points and our brand love with our core customer segment also rose more than 300 basis points. We saw our customers increasingly interact with us across all of our channels, driving revenue growth in our stores, online and in our in-home channel. I note in particular that 22% of the domestic business in Q4 came through the online channel. Our success with our customers is driven by the enthusiasm and the talent of our employees. Our employee engagement scores remain remarkably high, and we further reduced turnover rates in our stores to new record lows. Strategically, we've made progress in expanding what we do for our customers and how we interact with them. Here are a handful of examples. The first example is the launch of our Total Tech Support program. Having a service that provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology no matter where or when they brought it is a compelling and unique value proposition for our members. We continue to be pleased with the customer enrollment and ended the year with more than 1 million members. Another example is the expansion of our In-Home Advisor program. During fiscal 2019, we expanded the program from 300 to approximately 530 advisors and provided more than 175,000 free in-home consultations to customers across the nation. The revenue per order that we generate from these interactions continues to be much higher than in the store and online and it tends to have a higher gross profit rate as well due to the basket and higher attach rate of paid services. Both employees and customers love it, the Net Promoter Score is high and the advisor employee turnover is low. In health, we acquired a leading connected health services provider for aging consumers GreatCall and took a tangible step forward in our strategy to have seniors live longer in their homes with the help of technology. Since we acquired the company in October, the integration has been seamless and the value creation opportunities we envision have begun to materialize. During fiscal 2019, we continued to elevate the customer experience around product fulfillment, enabled by the advancement of our supply chain transformation, for small products through a combination of initiatives including expanded partnerships and automation. We continue to improve our speed of delivery to customers and expanded next day and same day delivery options. We now offer same day delivery on thousands of items in 40 metro areas and next day in 60 metro areas. And of course customers also have the option to pick up their products in our stores within one hour of placing their order. For large products like appliances and TVs we expanded our distribution center capacity and brought locations closer to customers, which is driving significant improvements in the quality of our delivery and installation service. In parallel to the customer experience work, we continued to drive efficiencies and reduced costs in order to fund investments and offset pressures. During fiscal 2019, we achieved $265 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies, bringing the cumulative total to $500 million since Q2 fiscal 2018. This is towards our fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million and since the launch of Renew Blue in 2012 we have now taken $1.9 billion of cost out. In addition to these accomplishments, we're very proud of our progress in advancing our corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts. In fact, we were just named number one on Barron's annual 100 Most Sustainable Companies list. So in summary, we're very pleased with the results we are producing as we implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy and I so appreciate the hard work of our associates as well as our partners in driving these terrific results. And I want to recognize them publicly here. So as we look forward, we are excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Before I say more about these, let me say a few words about the economic environment. There has been much discussion about the economy. I would note that the latest Bloomberg composite forecast which aggregates the basket of economic forecast, calls for consumer spending to increase 2.7% in 2019, which is similar to 2018 levels and another 2.1% in 2020. So on this basis we expect to continue to operate in a positive consumer environment in 2019. Now beyond this, what drives our performance is primarily two factors, technology innovation and the relevance of our strategy and quality of our execution. In this context, we are excited by the opportunities related to technology innovation that has the potential to drive customer demand over the next several years. This kind of increases expanded penetration of existing technology, introduction of new technology in existing categories, and expansion of consumer technologies in new areas. Notably in existing categories like Home Theater, we see opportunities relating to increasing he penetration of large screen sizes 4K and OLED, and from the introduction of new technologies such as 8K. In mobile, we see new technology innovation in areas like wireless power, security and accessibility. We're also excited to watch as foldable phones emerge over the next several months and of course we'll be actively participating in the rise of 5G, which has a potential to unlock very interesting used cases over the next several years. In computing, the interest in gaming continues to accelerate and the performance necessary for this is driving innovation across both hardware and accessories. We also see significant opportunities in Smart Home technology. Notably the US retail market size of Internet of things connected hardware is forecasted to triple by 2025. This growth is buoyed by products like Smart Home connected cameras, which according to a recent report from consulting firm Activate are expected to grow from 18% penetration of US homes in 2018 to more than 50% penetration by 2022. We also believe that digital health is an exciting area with enormous opportunities from the use of technology to help customers with their health, fitness, sleep et cetera across multiple age groups from babies to seniors. As an illustration of the opportunity, the number of digital health exhibitors at the Consumer Electronics Show in January was up almost 25% versus last year. The next reason we're excited about the opportunities ahead of us is we believe the purpose driving our strategy is extremely relevant. Our purpose is to enrich lives through technology by addressing key customer needs in areas such as entertainment, productivity, communications, food, security, and health and wellness. We are encouraged by the first steps we have taken in this direction and see the potential from expanding this focus to build deeper lasting customer relationships. In parallel to this, we continue to be excited by the potential for further cost reduction opportunities that can help us fund the investments in our strategy and offset pressures in the business. Finally, I am particularly excited by the power of our incredibly talented people, who are engaged, customer-oriented and driven by our purpose and strategy. As you know, we've recently realigned senior roles, responsibilities and resources to better align with the strategy and we can already see this has a potential to accelerate our pace. Altogether, this gives us the sense that now is the time to play offense to play to win and to accelerate our transformation both from a customer and revenue standpoint and from an efficiency standpoint. So with this as a backdrop, let me talk about our priorities for fiscal 2020. At the highest level, our priorities to continue to transform the company in support of our purpose to enrich lives through technology by bringing to market solutions that solve real customer needs and by building customer relationships. As such, we will continue to expand what we do for customers. So as it relates to Total Tech Support, we plan to grow the member base and improve the experience by adding new capabilities around self-service and proactive support. We will continue to expand our health business by scaling both the GreatCall consumer devices and services and the commercial monitoring service with a focus on the senior population. As children of aging parents, many of us would appreciate the potential power of our health monitoring service that enables seniors to live longer in their homes, while reducing related healthcare costs. We're currently in pilots with a number of managed care organizations. And over time, we believe this could become a material growth opportunity for us. Now we're not the only company who is interested in the digital health space but we believe our unique focus that combines our technology solution, our talent and our ability to go to people's homes, gives us a unique advantage. In support of our strategy, we'll continue to work with our vendor partners in new and expanded ways that leverage our unique capabilities to meet the needs of our customers. For example, we\u2019ve partnered with several vendors to create offers for our Total Tech Support members and many partners are engaged and in line to train, support and create solutions for our In-Home Advisors. In parallel, we will continue to evolve the way we interact with our customers. In the home channel, we will continue to expand our In-Home Advisor program including adding advisors and investing in tools to maximize their productivity. Our In-Home Advisor program is just one of the ways that we deliver experiences in the home today. And so we are developing a holistic home channel strategy to leverage all of the ways we currently interact with customers in the home to create meaningful relationships and further differentiate Best Buy. From a digital standpoint, we'll continue to innovate and design multi-channel experiences that serve customer needs across our website, app and other channels in ways that continue to improve the experience across online and physical shopping. We will continue with our supply chain transformation, including using technology, automation and process improvements to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed and improve delivery and installation. And we will continue to enhance both the proficiency of our associates and optimize the way they work in order to get stronger to drive stronger customer relationships and fulfill our customers' unique needs. In addition, as has been our brand over the last several years, we will keep driving cost reductions and efficiencies throughout the business. We've been on a run rate of more than $250 million in annualized reductions for the past two years. And we're not planning to slow down. So in conclusion, we are energized by our results, our momentum and our opportunities as we implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy. As we look at our fiscal 2020 guidance specifically we\u2019re expecting comparable sales growth of 0.5% to 2.5%. This growth expectation is of course on top of the best two year stack in 14 years and reflects factors such as the anticipated cyclical slowdown of the console gaming category and the continued maturation of the mobile phone category. We are again planning to hold our operating rate -- operating income rate constant reflecting our focus on balancing investments in our strategy, processing the business and efficiencies. We like the continued rate of technology innovation and the capabilities technology can bring to people's lives. We like our opportunity to offer customers a more consultative approach to truly address their needs, provide them an increasing range of services and solutions, expand our relationship with them and become a bigger part of their lives. And we particularly like the opportunities we have in the connected house space following the acquisition of GreatCall. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Corie for more details on our Q4 performance and our fiscal 2020 guidance. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $14.8 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.72. The EPS result exceeded our expectations and our revenue performance was at the high end of our guidance range. From a product category standpoint, we saw better than expected comparable sales results in our wearable and gaming categories and lower than expected sales in mobile phones. Our operating income rate exceeded our expectations, primarily due to strong expense management. I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. As Mollie stated, this year's fourth quarter included 13 weeks, which compares to last year's 14 week quarter. We estimate the extra week last year was approximately $760 million in revenue and approximately $0.20 of non-GAAP diluted EPS. Enterprise comparable sales increased 3%. Revenue decreased 3.7% to $14.8 billion, primarily driven by the lapping of last year's extra week. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.30 or 12% to $2.72. This increase was primarily driven by : higher operating income, a $0.22 per share benefit from the net share count change and an $0.08 per share benefit driven by a lower non-GAAP effective income tax rate. These items were partially offset by non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.20 from the extra week last year. As we expected and shared with you last quarter, our comparable sales growth of 3% included a positive 50 basis point impact from the calendar shift. As a reminder, our reported comparable sales are computed on like-for-like fiscal weeks and are not shifted to more closely aligned calendar weeks following last year's 53 week year. In our Domestic segment, comparable sales increased 3% and revenue decreased 3.5% to $13.5 billion. This revenue decrease was primarily driven by lapping of last year's extra week and the loss of revenue from 257 Best Buy Mobile and 12 large format store closures in the past year. Partially offsetting these declines were the 3% comparable sales gains and revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in our fiscal third quarter. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were wearables, appliances, which include both major and small appliances, Smart Home and gaming. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our mobile phone category. Domestic online revenue of $2.96 billion was 21.9% of domestic revenue compared to 20% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 9.3% on top of 17.9% growth in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily driven by higher conversion and increased traffic. In our International segment, comparable sales increased 2.5% and revenue decreased 5.2% to $1.3 billion. The increase was primarily due to the lapping of last year's extra week, and approximately 470 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The comparable sales increase was driven by both Canada and Mexico. Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise gross profit rate decreased 10 basis points to 22.2%. The Domestic gross profit rate was 22.1% versus 22.3% last year. The 20 basis point decline was driven primarily by an approximate 30 basis point negative impact from a lower periodic profit sharing benefit from the company\u2019s services plan portfolio and an approximately 30 basis point negative impact from higher supply chain costs, including both investments and higher transportation costs. The impact of the profit share was worse than expected, and the higher supply chain costs were in line with expectations. These pressures were partially offset by : One, the impact of GreatCall\u2019s higher gross profit rate; Two, an improved gross profit rate in the services category, which included a refinement in the revenue recognition of the company's Total Tech Support offer; And three, improved products margin rate, which included the benefit of gross profit optimization initiatives. Regarding the revenue recognition refinement, we now have sufficient history of member utilization of the program to move from recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the membership contract to recognizing revenue on a usage basis, therefore, better matching the fulfillment cost with the revenue. This refinement of revenue recognition impacted new contracts created during our fiscal fourth quarter. This accelerated both revenue and gross profit recognition compared to our previous revenue recognition timing. This revenue recognition refinement was contemplated in the guidance we provided last quarter but the actual impact was slightly more favorable than we had estimated in our initial usage analysis. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 50 basis points to 22.9%, primarily due to a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which was driven by improved gross profit rates in several product categories and increased revenue in the higher margin rate services category. These improvements were partially offset by an approximate 30 basis point negative impact from a lower periodic profit sharing benefit and gross profit rate pressure in the mobile phone category. Now turning to SG&A, Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $2.29 billion or 15.5% of revenue, which decreased $150 million and 40 basis points to last year as a percentage of revenue. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $2.08 billion, or 15.4% of revenue versus $2.22 billion or 15.8% of revenue last year. The $134 million decrease was primarily due to the lapping of last year\u2019s extra week and cost reduction. There were a number of other largely offsetting items as lower expenses associated with incentive compensation and stronger expense management were offset by : growth investments, which include specialty labor and higher depreciation expense; GreatCall operating expenses; and higher variable costs associated with increased revenue. International non-GAAP SG&A was $207 million or 15.9% of revenue versus $223 million or 16.2% of revenue last year. The $16 million decrease was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, and lapping the extra week last year, which were partially offset by higher payroll and incentive-related expenses in Canada and the impact of new stores opened in Mexico in the past year. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate decreased to 24.6% from 27% last year. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the reduction in the US statutory corporate tax rate as a result of tax reform, partially offset by a larger benefit from the resolution of discrete tax matters in the prior year. As a reminder, the lower statutory tax rate became effective on January 1st, and was applied to our full quarter this year compared to approximately one month in last year's comparable quarter. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the year with a 4% higher inventory balance compared to last year, whereas our accounts payable increased 8%. The lower owned inventory position was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts over the holiday season. In fiscal 2020, we will adopt a new standard for lease accounting. We anticipate the new standard will materially increase our assets and liabilities, but we expect it will have an immaterial impact on our net earnings. As it relates to capital allocation, our approach has not changed. Our strategy is to fund operations and investments in growth, including potential acquisitions, and then to return excess free cash flow over time to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining investment grade credit metrics. We continue to target a non-GAAP dividend payout ratio between 35% and 45%. This morning, we announced that we increased our quarterly dividend 11% to $0.50 per share, and provided an outlook for share repurchases of $750 million to $1 billion in fiscal 2020. We also announced that the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3 billion, [replacing] the existing authorization from February 2017. I would now like to talk about our full year fiscal 2020 financial guidance. Enterprise revenue in the range of $42.9 billion to $43.9 billion; Enterprise comparable sales up 0.5% to 2.5%; Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.6%, which is flat to fiscal '19\u2019s rate; Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $5.45 to $5.65; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5%; and capital expenditures in the range of $850 million to $900 million. I would like to call out a number of assumptions reflected in our annual guidance. Our investments, in particular in specialty labor, technology and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies. Although there may be variations between quarters, our outlook for the full year assumes gross profit as a percent of revenue will be approximately flat to fiscal 2019 as continued investments in supply chain and higher transportation costs are offset by the higher margin rate of GreatCall. SG&A dollars are expected to grow as a percentage in the low single-digits and be approximately flat as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2019. The increased expenses of GreatCall and continued investments in technology and wages are expected to be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our performance targets to align with our fiscal 2020 expectations. As it relates to US tariffs on imports of certain products from China, we told you last quarter that we estimate a $200 billion lift that went into effect in September touches only about 7%, or around $2.3 billion of our total cost of goods sold. Our fiscal 2020 outlook assumes that the tariff stay at the current rate of 10%. I would also like to talk specifically about Q1, where we are expecting the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $9.05 billion to$9.15 billion; Enterprise comparable sales growth of flat to 1%; Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.83 to $0.88; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 22.5%; and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 272 million shares. Finally, as Hubert referenced, we have essentially met our previous revenue and operating income target for fiscal 2021, two years early. We plan to host an Investor Day during our fiscal third quarter, where we will provide an update on the progress of our strategy and share more details on our mid-range financial goals. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So I think, first of all, great results and I think probably played better than people thought. But as we look at the outlook, one of the things that we've struggled with a lot with Best Buy is just how do we grow the business and look at the growth of the business going forward? I mean, obviously, the guidance is fairly de minimis growth on the EBIT line. How should we look at it, over a more multi-year period driving comps over a longer term? And what's that level? I mean, can we think of it as a 2% to 3% comp grow or is that still hard to do? Corie Barry : Thank you for the question and also the compliment on the results. The longer term outlook, if you go back to the Investor Day that we had in the fall of 2017, we put an outlook out there that said we believe strongly we have the ability to grow in that low-single-digits range with flattish operating income at least in the mid-term with that point going through fiscal 2021. We delivered a bit ahead of that the last couple years. Obviously the guide over the next year is right in line with that. And given the environment as Hubert talked about the amount of excitement we have about technology, the execution and just how strongly we feel our strategy is positioned well with our customers, we feel like that line of thinking is appropriate as we look out at least through that 2021 range. And then obviously we'll update you more as we have our Investor Day in Q3 on how we're thinking about any longer term after that. But I think you've seen our guides consistent with that point of view and we don't see anything in front of us that changes our belief in that trajectory. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Keith : Corie, I just want to dig into the margin guidance, so I can appreciate you guys want to stick to the flat EBIT margin year-on-year. However, going into this year, I was thinking you had some easier compares because the Total Tech Support launch was about 15 to 20 basis points of pressure, which was like in my clawback. So can you just walk us through that EBIT margin outlook in the face of these easy compares, what some of the offsets are? Corie Barry : Yes, you bet. So one of the things that we wanted to make sure we landed as well, we had hit the financial goals that we laid out when we had our Investor Day in the fall of 2017. I think all of us would say we still have room to grow in terms of our strategic goals, meaning bringing to life some of those customer solutions that Hubert talked about, and really finding ways to improve those relationships with our customers. And we started down that road with offerings like the IHA experience, TTS as an example and even just the early interactions we have and offerings we have with GreatCall. That being said, we still feel strongly we have a long way to go to make those really stickier and more repetitive relationship-based offerings with our customers. And so there are additional investments which we had always pondered since we talked with you all at Investor Day that we knew we would need to make over time. And while Total Tech Support was kind of one part of that in launching that last year, there are continued investments and things like supply chain. We specifically called out specialty labor in our stores and we also specifically called out a continued technology build that will help us enable some of the strategies and bring those to life. And so, the reason that we laid out a longer kind of mid-term view in 2017 is because we knew this would be a multi-year journey of investments and while Total Tech Support represented one type of those, there will continue to be additional investments as we go into future. Now, obviously, we're offsetting a number of those with the continued cost reduction. But we're trying to find that balance between making sure we actually -- and Hubert said it, continue to actually accelerate our investments because we like what we're seeing in a way that's going to create those differentiated customer experiences. And so you\u2019ll see those continuing into FY '20 in a way that we think we'll develop better experiences for our customers. Hubert Joly : In other words, Peter, this is a choice. We could decide to slow down the investments and increase the operating income rate. We believe the best way for us to create long-term value for our shareholders is to continue to play to win, invest in our future, because we think the reward, the medium-term, long-term rewards of building this unique differentiation, these relationships, these solutions, is very exciting. And so that's why we're managing the business this way. Peter Keith : Okay. But can't argue with the returns you're getting thus far. I may bend the rules a little bit here. I just want to stick on that Total Tech Support. The comp in the services segment, nearly 14% was as high as I can remember. I'm curious if that was due to the change in the revenue recognition policy. And just as we play that forward, should those services kind of run at a above average rate for the next couple of quarters as a result of the change? Corie Barry : Yes, about half of the growth that we saw in that services comp was due to the refinement in the revenue recognition policy. And you're going to continue to see that into the next couple of quarters, while we roll that out over the last few year's straight line. So that will continue to be -- but the good news is with there being half still sitting under that is a good healthy growth in that services business. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan Wewer : Thanks. Just looking to see if you could comment a bit further on the changes in the Total Tech Support offer. And then also with respect to the accounting change, Corie, you talked about the impact the next few quarters, will it benefit all of 2020 EBIT rate as it did in the fourth quarter? Corie Barry : So I'll start with the last question. It won't be the entire year because obviously we're going to lap the change necessarily when we get to Q4, so you'll see some of it as you run the early part of the year but you'll ultimately lap the change. Your first question was to expand a little bit on the change and exactly why we refined the methodology. Basically, we have sufficient history now. We've had the program long enough. We ran full rollout last year around May. And once we have the sufficient history it was much easier for us to actually match the revenue with the actual usage, because we had enough history for us to know that customers were using it a bit more upfront than ratably over the life of the contract, which is how we were initially recognizing it. And so that means you pull a bit more of the revenue to match more precisely with the fulfillment cost early in the life of the contract versus ratably over the contract. We'll keep watching the usage and make sure we're continuing to match the revenue with the usage. Because the truth is, all the things the team is working on is to make sure people are using it more consistently over the life of the contract. And so I think you'll see us continue to tweak the offering and tweak what do those customers get in a way that will help us drive more consistent usage throughout the life of the contract, but for now we're -- really it\u2019s just a matching principle making sure that the revenue is in line with the fulfillment cost. Dan Wewer : If the customers are front-loading the usage of Total Tech Support, is there a risk that data renewal rate could drop more than you would expect, because they're probably not using Total Tech Support in maybe months 10, 11 and 12? Dan Wewer : I was going to say, Dan, the renewal rates are in line with our expectations. In my prepared remarks, I did comment on the fact that we were going to continue to invest in the development of the customer experience, in order precisely to build these stickier customer relationships. So I've talked about more self service capabilities, also more proactive support. So for example, to proactively tell you that your firmware needs to be upgraded or that maybe you have opportunities to clean up your computer to get back to that speed that you had initially, or maybe advice around parental control and security, so self service proactive. And also in my prepared remarks I talked about how we are expanding the vendor partnerships in new ways, getting into more of these service areas. And so, you'll see us continue to innovate, because one of our -- precisely one of our goals is to expand these customer relationships and measures that\u2019s stickier over time. So again, in line with expectations, but opportunity to continue to evolve our customer relationships. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : So I just wanted to kind of take a step back because I was little looking through my notes. When we had this call a year ago, you're coming off of your best year in quite some time. You did that 9% comp in the fourth quarter of 2017. That was your best comp I believe in 13 years. And you got it to $4.80 to $5 a share on EPS and a zero to 2% comp for the full year. You did $5.32 in EPS and a 4.8% comp. And that was with flowing iPhone sales that was with Amazon carry more Apple products. So I'm just trying to understand like clearly there's a lot that broke right in 2018. I would just love your comments just in terms of what went right in 2018 that maybe you weren't expecting or are you just being very conservative when you guided to the $4.80 to $5 and the zero to 2% comp. Corie Barry : There were a couple of things that we actually talked about at the start of the year that broke rights here rising. One, we've talked about our belief that the gaming cycle might actually slow a bit heading into last year and we were very clear. That tends to be a more cyclical business after having such great switch results. What we didn't have line of visibility to was a phenomenon that would become fortnight in particular and the social gaming side of things, because that carries not only the switch as a console, but listed all those in gaming. It listed computing gaming, it listed peripherals or the headphones and the things that are used in gaming, it listed all of those. And that genuinely was something that we didn't see in front of us being quite as strong as it turned out to be for the year. And that was a material change versus our original expectations. If you look at the rest of the business and I think Hubert talked about this a little bit, when you're talking about what is it that makes us excited about where we are, I also think there was an execution element around the strategy that continued to be early on a little bit of what our initial expectations were at the start of the year. Obviously a good consumer environment health, but on the back of a good consumer environment and clear interest in technology, our execution and our ability to deliver on that more relationship-based experience in our stores, in homes, online, I think actually genuinely performed even better than necessarily going into the year and when you have a better consumer environment then necessarily you imagine -- and you put on top of that even better execution and better acceleration of the strategy. I think you also just end up accelerating the results in a way you didn't necessarily expect at the beginning of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Can you break down your outlook, your comp outlook for 2020 in terms of what you expect the consumer electronics market to grow at and what you think your share gains are going to be in the year ahead? Also, you rolled out a new leasing program, lease to own, how much have you factored into your guidance that, that will contribute in the year ahead? Corie Barry : So let's start with the first question around kind of what we're thinking through the industry. The last couple years, the industry depending on the quarter obviously there's ebbs and flows, but you've seen flat up slightly across the industry. And remember, this is a broader definition of the industry, not just NPD, you have to think about things like gaming and phones and appliances and the Apple products. You've definitely seen flash up a little bit. As Hubert informed in some of his opening remarks, we don't see anything in front of us as the trajectory of the industry massively changes. And so we're expecting that same kind of ranges of maybe it's flattish, maybe up a little bit or something in that realm would make sense given the guide that we're seeing. Therefore, share gains is anywhere from maintaining the share that we have today to maybe slight share gains over the year. In terms of the leasing program, we have -- we were testing an expanded leasing program in a couple of markets. We were pleased with the results that we've been seeing and therefore are now going to expand the number of stores with our leasing solution. I think what we like about it is it actually opens up the opportunity for customers who might not otherwise be able to have credit or otherwise be able to have access to the kind of products that we sell. It opens up access to that product at a whole new customer base for us. That is included in the guide that we gave you and so you can assume that we\u2019ve factored that in. But most importantly we like that we can potentially open up the experiences that we offer to a whole customer base that might not otherwise have the chance to purchase the set of products that we sell. Michael Lasser : If I could just sneak one last question in. We're getting the question, what was the contribution from the accounting change around Total Tech Support in the fourth quarter? Corie Barry : So remember, not an accounting change. It is a refinement of how we're recognizing the revenue just to be very clear. We haven't called out exactly what the amount is, but I would think about it as roughly enough to kind of offset the impact that we saw or about half the impact that we saw from our warranty program. So the downside of the warranty, about half of that was offset by the upside from the refinement of the revenue recognition on Total Tech Support. Operator : Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : So can you help us understand how you're thinking about the impact of Apple's expanded distribution on a 1P basis to Amazon and Costco, obviously, they're incredibly important partner of yours. And just trying to think about the potential dilutive impact of their expanded distribution on your business? Hubert Joly : Yes. Thank you, Scot. So we reported in Q4 comps that were at the top end of our range of 3% and that reflected or that included the impact of the expanded distribution of Apple. So we feel good about this. What I would say is that when we work with our key vendor partners, we work to make sure that the customer experience we offer is very unique and really meets the customer expectations. And frankly, in the case of Apple in particular we're very proud, the experience we provide both in our stores in our -- we have 900 Apple Stores within our stores. We have 3,000 Apple experts in our stores. We've also expanded our relationship with them around services. We probably are the largest reseller of Apple Care. And we provide Apple service in some of our stores. And frankly, as is the case with our key vendor partner, we'll continue to innovate and move the relationship forward in ways that are in line with the goals of that vendor partner and advance the customer experience. So we live in a world, where we get to compete with some of the world's foremost companies. You've named a couple and there's a few others and that makes our sport stimulating. And so these kinds of move forwards are encouragement to keep moving because some experience forward so that we offer a unique customer experience and we drive innovation and experiences for our customers. Scot Ciccarelli : Just to be clear it looks like mobile phones actually declined in the quarter. Is the expectation as we kind of roll through calendar '19, mobile is in kind of a perpetual decline situation or was this kind of like the initial impact and you guys expect to your share and obviously failed in mobile to continue to ramp? Corie Barry : So just to be clear, I\u2019d separate the mobile discussion a little bit from the expanded distribution discussion. Mobile, what we're seeing in mobile is a different question. I think you've seen lots -- written in a lot in the public, about just in general a maturation of the mobile cycle, the replacement cycles extending for people who are buying mobile phones and general softness. We actually don't feel like this was as much a question of share loss associated with any kinds of distribution changes. This is more just a question of broadly how often are people buying what are now pretty trendy phones and replacing them. And we've taken that -- and we said it specifically in our prepared remarks, we've taken some of that expectation and pushed it forward into our guide for next year. And by the way, we've been pretty consistent on our expectations for the mobile business over the last couple of years. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JP Morgan. Christopher Horvers : I wanted to follow up on the operating margin question which I -- clearly a focal point out there. So Corie can you share what the operating margin expanded on a 52 versus 52 week basis, presumably if it was up 30 in against the 53 week or the 14 week, it would have been up something higher than that. So the question on '19 is basically so are investments accelerating because it doesn't sound like the expense opportunity is slowing or is the level of comp perhaps the difference? So if you did a 3% comp in 19, like you did in 4Q, would you actually see operating margin expansion? Corie Barry : So for the year, if I were to adjust, FY19 versus FY18 on a 52 to 52 week basis, we have 10 basis points of operating income rate expansion. If you remember at the beginning year, we had guided flat on a 52 week basis, which would have been the 4.5%. We had 10 basis points of operating income rate expansion. And that was on a pretty significantly higher top-line than we expected, obviously, almost the 5% comp on the top-line. And so I think as you look into next year, obviously we gave you the range and we believe that will lead to a flattish operating income rate. I wouldn't say the investments have accelerated, I think it goes back to the original conversation we were having, which is we continue to make targeted investments in the places that we told you in the fall of '17 that will help us accelerate our progress on our initiatives. They are different really in pace than we had expected at the beginning. And we feel pretty comfortable that we actually like the pacing in they are in line with what we had thought at the time that we gave the original guidance. And so to your question, yes, if you massively outperform the top-line, obviously we may come back to you with a different economic equation. But from what we see in front of us, I feel pretty comfortable about what we're showing. It takes into account both the cost reductions we see in front of us and the investment profile. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then -- and as a follow up, there's a lot of noise out there around tax refunds. Can you remind us a few years ago, when they were delayed, did that actually impact your business and is there anything that you're seeing in the business now with tax refund dollars being lower year-over-year such that, are you expecting some catch-up in the latter part of the quarter? Corie Barry : So it was two years ago we actually specifically commented, as to exact time, I remember the call distinctly, on there being a slowdown in the quantity of tax returns. In that year what we saw was actually most of that did come back to us and most of it back in Q1 as the quantity of tax returns evened out throughout the quarter. We're feeling a little bit of softness right now due to what has very clearly publicly been both a quantity of tax returns being down but also the amount for return right now is down. And what we're keeping an eye on is not as much even just the quantity question but also the amount for return and how that ultimately will impact our business over the quarter. The good news is at the end of the day, people will see reductions in their tax rates meaning their take home pay throughout the year no matter what the amount of the return is in and of itself. So it kind of becomes a timing question throughout the year. But we're definitely watching and have incorporated some of those thoughts into the Q1 guide. Operator : Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Curtis Nagle : So just want to focus a little bit more on the lease to own program, I guess how much is it is in the guide? And then B, just I guess more of a theoretical question. Why did you choose to roll it out, I know you guys said that it's helping. But -- and I know in terms of credit risk you're probably not going to bear any, but inherently it is a lower quality business and process is arguably less sustainable given that these are customers who typically can\u2019t qualify credit or typically lower income. So I guess do you see any risk to that? Corie Barry : So first of all, obviously, we're not going to comment on the exact amount that's included in the guide. But we've included some amounts in the guide. We specifically did test this in a couple of markets. And I think what's important here is that this genuinely is a whole new tranche of customers that would not be able to purchase products with us. The agreements that we have, we don't bear the risk over the longer term of the agreement. And so it is -- I think it makes a ton of sense for us. That being said, I think it makes even more sense for the customers. At the end of the day, what we want to do is be able to serve the widest lots of customers we can and give them access to the type of products that we sell. And these are customers who likely would not qualify for the credit offering that we have. And therefore this gives them an option to be able to actually qualify for some type of agreement with Best Buy and then be able to pay that off over time. And so I think we feel pretty passionately, so there is actually opens the doors to a whole new -- I mean think about it, sometimes this isn't just people who have bad credit, this is people who in some cases just have no credit. And this is the start for them to be able to build a credit portfolio and actually will lead to a much more robust credit portfolio over time. And history has shown up very, very, very few to the less than 1% range of these customers go delinquent on their agreements. And so this is actually a very nice offering and in fact I think helps a lot the population create credit when they might not otherwise have some. Hubert Joly : So this is the customer acquisition play with catching people early on in their credit history and with a view to build relationships over time. So this is actually consistent with our overall strategy of helping customers, we are going to help more customers and allow them to neutralize with technology with a view of a relationship over time. This is not a deviation from the strategy. So we're excited about it, it makes sense from a customer standpoint and obviously from a financial standpoint as well. Curtis Nagle : And just really quick on the buyback, it looks like guidance is lower than what you did for this year, is that just some conservatism? It does look like your cash flow probably would support more. So I'm just curious how to think about that? Corie Barry : Obviously behind the scenes we're always taking a look at the cash flow making sure we feel like we have a minimum level of cash that makes sense and would support us through a number of different scenarios. We clearly spent almost $1 billion last year on our GreatCall acquisition and so very in line with our capital allocation strategy. We've always said, we're first going to invest in the business either to fund operations or through acquisition. Second, premium dividend payer. And then third with that access and by access we mean above and beyond whatever that minimum balance is we feel we need, we will then return that to shareholders and so that's in essence not that we did this year and we'll keep revisiting that every single year depending on the cash flow that we generate, that this seem like the right amount given what has historically been our capital positioning. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one final question. And last question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matt McClintock : I was wondering Hubert two questions real quick. The first one is just you talk about the customer relationship extensively on this call and creating that relationship with In-Home Advisors. And I was wondering now that the program has been out for well over a year, what efforts have you made in terms of monetizing the tale of that relationship throughout the year? Have you had some success there? Hubert Joly : Yes, I think we're still at the beginning of our journey to build ongoing customer relationships. The -- I think In-Home Advisor provides us opportunity, I think we're still learning, kind of setting up scale, it\u2019s interesting as a retailer, certainly, we've been -- and we\u2019ve said this before we've been focused on transactions and selling products. So moving towards selling solutions and building relationships. This journey is at the beginning and we're learning, I think we're seeing, we're very excited by the results. But building that's institutional capability is something that will take time. As an illustration that involves modifying or adding a new focus on new key performance indicators. As a retailer, you would focus on transactions, growth rates, basket and so forth. As a customer relationship focused retailer, you're going to be focused in a local market, that how many households are there. How many of them are Best Buy customers with whom we have a relationship, what\u2019s my share of wallet. Just by saying these things, I think you can feel the magnitude of the change we're operating and that relates to the investments we're making, the training, the tools and so forth. And which is at the beginning of that journey which personally for me is a side of excitement because you can see the upside and we have captured any meaningful part of the upside from there. So very early on in the innings of that journey. Matt McClintock : Thanks for that. And then if I could squeeze one more in, just in terms of mobile, you brought up 5G and you brought up the foldable phone. Could you talk about how that could revitalize the category overall and potentially be a game changer, meaning it seems like with the ASPs of the foldable phone, you might be looking at something similar to historically how tablets impacted your business overall? Hubert Joly : And with us on the call we have Mike Mohan our Chief Operating Officer for the US business. And Mike is going to take that question and then we'll just wrap. Mike Mohan : Thanks for the question, Matt. It's an exciting time to see what's happening in technology. Clearly, we have talked about the increasing price of all mobile devices. And so all of this new technology is going to have a fairly limited appeal from an acquisition standpoint, but an extremely high level of interest from consumer, what it can do for them, and how does it solve used cases. So what we're most excited about is showcasing the technology, inviting customers into our stores, onto our site, and even having some of the products in our In-Home Advisor when you go visit people so we can show people what we can do. And I think it positions us in a very unique place to show how technology will continue help enrich people's lives and I think that's probably the best way to put our excitement in this area. We will always lean forward on something that will help customers solve a problem and I think they would expect us to take a leadership position here. Hubert Joly : I just want to say thank you Mike. And in closing, I want to again show my hats-off appreciation for the work and talent and passion of all of our associates across all functions in the business. You guys are amazing. And I want to thank you for joining our call and your interest in Best Buy. And we look forward to continue to update you as we continue to move forward. So you have a great day. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1 :00 P.M. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mollie O'Brien: Thank you and good morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Hubert Joly, our Chairman and CEO, Corie Barry, our CFO and Chief Transformation Officer and Mike Mohan, our U.S. Chief Operating Officer. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Hubert. Hubert Joly : Thank you Mollie and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us for what is my last earnings call as CEO of this great company. As you know, we made an exciting announcement last month. On June 11, Corie Barry will become the fifth CEO in Best Buy's 53 year history. At that time, I will transition to the newly created role of Executive Chairman of the Board. Also, Mike Mohan role will be elevated as he moves from being our domestic Chief Operating Officer to the company's President and Chief Operating Officer. I am very proud of the seamless transition we have decided to implement as it reflects positively on our momentum as well as on our focus on executive development and succession planning. It is clearly designed to ensure strategic and leadership continuity and I am grateful to the members of our Board of Directors for their diligence and care in overseeing this critical process. Before I share more thoughts on our leadership transition, let me first review our quarterly performance and provide an update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020 : Building the New Blue strategy. I will then turn the call over to Corie for additional details on our financial results and outlook. So Q1 was a strong quarter and a good start to the year. We reported $9.14 billion in revenue and grew our enterprise comparable sales by 1.1%, which was at the high end of our guidance. We also delivered better-than-expected profitability. We expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 50 basis points and delivered on non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.02, which was up 24% compared to the first quarter of last year. I want to thank our associates across the company for their hard work and dedication in delivering these strong results. Before I discuss the progress we made on our Best Buy 2020 strategy, I would like to share some brief thoughts on tariffs on goods from China. First, let me say that the administration has so far done a very good job of minimizing the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers by limiting the number of consumer products on the tariff list. They have done this in part by taking input from companies like us. And so far, we have been able to minimize the impact of these tariffs by employing a number of mitigation strategies, including by buying products ahead of the tariffs being implemented and by working with our vendors. Second, -- [AUDIO GAP] Operator : Pardon the interruption. This is the operator. We are having a little bit of trouble hearing you, sir. Sir, we are still unable to hear you. Hubert Joly : Okay. Operator : Sir, we are still having a little bit of trouble hearing you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are experiencing a temporary interruption in today's call. Please stand by and the call will recommence very shortly. Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your patience. The conference will now recommence. Hubert Joly : We are sorry for the interruption because of and I apologize for that, technical issue. I will recommence my comments with when I started to talk about tariffs and tariffs on goods from China. So what I was saying is that first, the administration has so far done a very good job of minimizing the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers by limiting the number of consumer products on the tariff list. And they have done is in part by taking input from companies like us. And so far, we have been able to minimize the impact of these tariffs by employing a number of mitigation strategies, including by buying products ahead of the tariffs being implemented and by working with our vendors. Second, no decision has been made by the administration at this point on the actual implementation of tariffs on additional product categories. There is a comprehensive process the administration will be going through to take inputs and we intend to be actively engaged in this process to help the administration continue to minimize the impact of tariffs on U.S. consumers. In addition, there is time for the trade negotiations to progress before any decision gets made. As Corie will discuss, our fiscal 2020 guidance incorporates the estimated impact of the recent move from 10% to 25% tariffs on this List 3. As a reminder, we estimate that List 3, which is the $200 billion list that went into effect last September is only about 7% of our total annual cost of goods sold. Many of the products on this list are accessories. And while we understand List 4 as proposed is comprised of many consumer items, including many electronics, we think it is premature to speculate on the impact of further tariffs as it is unclear whether List 4 will actually be implemented, what products would ultimately be included, at what rates and when. But one thing is of course certain as other retailers have noted the impact of tariffs at 25% will result in price increases and will be shelled by U.S. consumers. We will of course continue to work to minimize the impact of the trade negotiations on U.S. consumers and will continue to update you on this matter. Now let me update on our progress as we implement our Best Buy 2020 strategy to enrich lives with technology and further develop our competitive differentiation. In health, we continue to make progress, both in terms of scaling the GreatCall consumer devices and services and advancing our commercial monitoring service with a focus on aging seniors. Our focus is to enable seniors to live longer in their homes and help reduce their healthcare costs. We believe that the combination of technology and our human touch provided through the ability to access and engage people in their home is a highly relevant and differentiated proposition. We are excited to continue to build our capabilities to support the growth of this business. First, we will be opening a third GreatCall caring center in October. The center, located in San Antonio, Texas with 400 care agents and provide 24x7 technical phone support, concierge services and urgent response services to customers. Second, this month we have required a senior focused health services company called Critical Signal Technologies or CST to help scale the commercial monitoring business. CST has approximately 100,000 senior subscribers. Some of [indiscernible] services as a supplemental benefits under their Medicare Advantage plan. Coverage under Medicare Advantage plans is helpful to growing our commercial business because it allows us to engage with insurers and build our service into their plans as a way to both improve their member experience and help them save on costs. The acquisition of CST will thereby help facilitate our access to in penetration of the commercial market. We are excited about the prospects of combining CST's services and relationships with the existing GreatCall business. More broadly, this tuck-in acquisition, together with GreatCall, complements our existing capabilities like Geek Squad and In-Home Advisors to better serve both the seniors in their home and those who support them like payors and providers. During Q1, we also continued to expand our Total Tech Support program, which provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology, no matter where or when they bought it. We continue to grow the member base at a steady rate while executing on our roadmap to drive the customer experience. Another first quarter example of how we are expanding what we do for customers is the rollout of our lease-to-own program. The financing provided through our Best Buy credit card is an important benefit we offer customers where there are people who are going to be interested in getting a credit card who are unable to quantify for it because of low credit scores or in many cases, simply no credit history. Our lease-to-own program provides another option for enabling customers to make periodic payments over a fixed period eventually leading to full ownership of the product once the agreement has been fulfilled. During the quarter, we launched the offer across 36 states or about 70% of our stores and expect to roll it out to another nine states later this year. Customers are using the option to acquire products across a wide variety of categories with the largest being computing. In addition, we found during the pilot that a significant number of customers are choosing to pick advantage of Progressive Leasing's 90-day purchase option, which consist of a $79 initial payment plus the retail price. The offering is consistent with our strategy to enrich lives through technology by opening up the experiences that we offer to new customers that might not otherwise have the chance to acquire the kind of solutions that we sell. In many cases, it will allow us to catch customers early on in their credit history and build a relationship with them over time. In addition to expanding what we do for customers, we are continuing to evolve the way we interact with our customers across their homes, our stores and digitally. As we mentioned during our last call, we are developing a holistic home strategy to leverage all of the ways we currently interact with customers in their home to create meaningful relationships and further differentiate Best Buy. Our in-home consultation program is one of the ways that we deliver experiences in the home today. The program continues to build and it is clear there is a real customer need we are addressing. And from a financial standpoint, we continue to see higher revenue per order and higher gross profit from these interactions in the store and online. We expect to add a similar number of advisors this year as we did last year, which would put us around 700 advisors at the end of the year. In addition, we are working to enhance the productivity of our advisors, but eliminating manual processes so that they can focus more time on their customers. For example, starting this quarter we will begin automating our proposal and client telling processes and enable the ability for customers to chat online real-time with their advisor. I would also like to say a few words about how we are transforming our supply chain to improve the experience for our customers. When we laid out a multiyear plan at our Investor Day in 2017, we shared our belief that the vast majority of our assortment need to be available anywhere you wanted the next day at the latest. Through a combination of initiatives including expanded partnerships, the deployment of metro e-commerce centers across key cities and automation, we continue to improve our speed of delivery to customers and expand next-day and same-day delivery options. As we shared last quarter, we offer same-day delivery on thousands of items in 40 metro areas. In addition, we offer next-day delivery options in 60 metro areas on orders over $35 for free with no membership fees. In fact, customers can order as late as 8 P.M. in Los Angeles and New York City and 5 :30 P.M. in the other metro areas and will get their package delivered the next day. 77% of Best Buy customers are in a ZIP Code where we are able to offer this service today and thousands of SKUs are eligible. In addition to our various shipping options, all of our customers also have the extremely convenient option to pick up their products in our stores within one hour of placing their order. Even with all the improved shipping options and enhancements available to our customers, they are increasingly choosing to pick up their products in one of our nearly 1,000 stores. And so in-store pickup of online orders is now about 40% of our online revenue and growing. Automation is an important part of our supply chain transformation and starting in Q4 of last year, we have been rolling out new automating boxing technology in our distribution center that builds real-time custom boxes for products coming down a conveyor belt. Earlier this year, Barron's named Best Buy number one on its list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies. And this cutting-edge boxing technology is an example of our sustainability efforts. In addition to driving productivity, it reduces environmental waste by eliminating excess corrugated cardboard and all-plastic packaging fillers. Overall our supply chain strategy is to leverage our assets of stores, distribution centers and metro e-commerce centers in a portfolio approach. That allows us to optimize speed, convenience and cost to meet customer needs at the right time and place. We are still in the midst of this multiyear transformation, but we like where we are and where we are going. Of course, we also continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and offset pressures. During the first quarter, we achieved $35 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies, bringing the cumulative total to $575 million since Q2 fiscal 2018. This is towards our fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million. Before I turn the call over to Corie, I would now like to say a few words about our upcoming management transition and my excitement about the future of our company. The choice of timing of the CEO transition is probably more of an art than a science. I personally felt it was the right time for me to trigger this leadership transition for several reasons. First, I had felt we had achieved what I had hoped to accomplish when I joined on the company in 2012. I am proud of what we have delivered for customers, our employees, our vendors, our shareholders and our communities. Second, I felt we had built the depth and breadth of talent necessary to carry Best Buy into the future. Last September, we put in place a new leadership organization by elevating Corie and Mike to new roles with greater responsibilities. In the time since then, I have been very impressed by the effectiveness of our team and these leaders. Third, with a clear an exciting purpose to enrich lives with technology, we set out two years ago to implement a strategy focused on addressing key human needs in entertainment, productivity, communication, food, security and health and wellness. We have essentially achieved fiscal 2021 revenue and non-GAAP operating income target two years ahead of plan. And while we still have a lot to do from a transformation standpoint, it is clear that we are on the right path. Fourth, we have announced plans to host a meeting with the investment community later this year. I thought it was important that the leaders who stand in front of this audience to lay out our roadmap for the future with a team that is responsible for carrying that strategy forward. So in my new role, I will of course continue to lead the Board of Directors. I will also advise and support Corie on key matters such as strategy, capability building, M&A and external relationships. In addition, I will assume certain responsibilities at Corie's request in areas like government affairs, community relations and leadership development. In closing, let me say that I could not be more excited about the opportunities ahead of us and confidence in the team we have built as well as our talents, culture, heart and soul. I look forward to continuing to work with Corie, the team and the Board in my new role manual to help them strategy and transformation with one goal in mind fulfilling our purpose to enrich lives with technology, doing well by doing good. And I want to thank you, our shareholders and journalists who cover, for your support over the past several years, I have thoroughly enjoyed our ongoing dialogue. Our interactions have not only been stimulating, but it has challenged us to be better as a management team and as a company. And likewise, I want to thank my colleagues for our collaboration and their friendship. Working together, we turned around and then began going this wonderful company. It has been the honor of my professional life to work with all of you as we did this. The company is in good hands with our new leadership and the best of talents we have. And I am confident that the journey we began in 2012 will continue well into the years ahead. And now, I am very excited to turn the call over to our CFO and future CEO, Corie Barry. Corie Barry : Good morning everyone. I am deeply grateful to Hubert and the rest of the Board of Directors for their confidence in me and their clear belief that this leadership evolution is in the best interests of Best Buy and all its stakeholders. Nearly seven years ago, the Board made a stunningly good decision when they asked a Frenchman with no retail experience to save this company and he brought his remarkable brain, boundless energy and deep passion to the job. My personal gratitude to Hubert knows no limits and I am delighted to have him nearby to call upon for advice and counsel in his new role as Executive Chair. As I think about my new role, I could not be more fortunate to have Mike Mohan at my side as our President and COO. I have worked closely with Mike for the past 15 years and I am so excited to continue to work with him and the rest of the leadership team in this next chapter as we implement the strategy that we helped build together. As far as my successor in the CFO role, we are in the midst of the search process for a new Chief Financial Officer. Now on to the Q1 financial details. Before I talk about our first quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $9.14 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.02. The EPS result exceeded our expectations and our revenue performance was near the high end of our guidance range. Our operating income rate exceeded our expectations, primarily due to a higher gross profit rate and strong expense management. The lower effective tax rate also provided a benefit of approximately $0.03 versus our earnings per share guidance. I will now talk about our first quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 0.4% to $9.14 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.1%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.20 or 24% to $1.02. This increase was primarily due to higher operating income, which was driven by lower incentive compensation and a $0.06 per share benefit from the net share count change. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 0.8% to $8.48 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.3% and revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October 2018, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 105 Best Buy mobile and 12 large-format store code closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances which includes both major and small appliances, wearables and tablets. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our entertainment category. Domestic online revenue of $1.31 billion was 15.4% of domestic revenue, up from 13.6% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 14.5% on top of 12% growth in the first quarter of last year, which was primarily driven by higher average order values and increased traffic. In our international segment, revenue decreased 5.2% to $661 million. This was primarily driven by approximately 390 basis points of negative foreign currency impact and a comparable sales decline of 1.2%. The comparable sales decline was driven by Canada and was partially offset by positive comparable sales in Mexico. Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise gross profit rate increased 40 basis points to 23.7%. The domestic gross profit rate was 23.7% versus 23.3% last year. The 40 basis point increase was primarily driven by the impact of GreatCall's higher gross profit rate and improved product margin rates, which included the benefit of gross profit optimization initiative. These favorable items were partially offset by higher supply chain costs. The international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 80 basis points to 24.2%, primarily due to higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which included improved gross profit rates in several product categories and increased revenue in the higher margin rate services category. Now turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.82 billion or 19.9% of revenue, which decreased $5 million and 10 basis points to last year as a percentage of revenue. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.66 billion or 19.6% of revenue versus 19.7% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars were essentially flat to last year as GreatCall operating expenses were primarily offset by lower incentive compensation expense. International non-GAAP SG&A was $158 million or 23.9% of revenue versus $164 million or 23.5% of revenue last year. The $6 million decrease was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates, which were partially offset by the impact of new stores opened in Mexico in the past year. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 20.1% compared to 20% last year. Versus our guidance, the effective tax rate was approximately 250 basis point better than expected which was primarily driven by a larger tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. From a cash flow perspective, we ended the quarter in line with our expectations. We returned a total of $232 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $98 million and dividends of $134 million. Our regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share was an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. As we announced last quarter, we intend to spend between $750 million and $1 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2020. In the first quarter, we adopted a new standard for lease accounting. The most significant impact of adoption was the recognition of operating lease assets of $2.7 billion and operating lease liabilities of $2.8 billion, respectively. The standard does not materially affect our consolidated statements of earnings or cash flows. Lastly, I will discuss our outlook. Our original full year guidance provided last quarter reflected our estimated impact from the List 3 tariffs at 10%. Today, we are reiterating that guidance. It balances our better-than-expected Q1 earnings, the fact that it is early in the year and our best estimate of the impact associated with the recent increase in tariffs on goods imported from China. Specifically, I am referring to the increase in tariffs from 10% to 25% on the products on the $200 billion List 3 that originally went into effect last September. Our fiscal 2020 guidance does not incorporate a List 4. As a reminder, our full year fiscal 2020 guidance includes enterprise revenue in the range of $42.9 billion to $43.9 billion and enterprise comparable sales of 0.5% to 2.5%. This topline growth expectation is on top of the best two year stack in 14 years and reflects factors such as the anticipated cyclical slowdown of the traditional console gaming category and the continued maturation of the mobile phone category. We expect our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 4.6%, which is flat to fiscal 2019's rate and reflects our focus on balancing investments in our strategy, pressures in the business and efficiencies. We expect our non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 24.5% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $5.45 to $5.65. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $850 million to $900 million. I would like to reiterate the assumptions reflected in our annual guidance that we shared last quarter. Our investments, in particular in specialty labor, technology and increased depreciation related to strategic capital investments and ongoing pressures in the business will be partially offset by a combination of returns from new initiatives and ongoing cost reductions and efficiencies. Although there will be variations between quarters, our outlook for the full year assumes gross profit as a percent of revenue will be approximately flat to fiscal 2019 as continued investments in supply chain and higher transportation costs are offset by the higher margin rate of GreatCall. SG&A dollars are expected to grow as a percentage in the low single digits and be approximately flat as a percent of revenue to fiscal 2019. Increased expenses of GreatCall and continued investments in technology and wages are expected to be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our performance targets to align with our fiscal 2020 expectations. For the second quarter specifically, we are expecting the following, enterprise revenue in the range of $9.5 billion to $9.6 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.95 to $1, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 269 million shares. I would like to provide a few notes of color for Q2. We expect our Q2 gross profit rate to expand slightly versus last year. We also expect our SG&A dollars to grow as a percentage in the low to mid single digits. This increase in SG&A is expected to come primarily from the higher GreatCall operating expenses and increased advertising spend. Although the higher SG&A will be partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense, the benefit versus last year is anticipated to be considerably lower than the year-over-year benefit we realized in Q1. Lastly, the acquisition of CST closed during Q2 and was funded with existing cash. The acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue or non-GAAP operating income this fiscal year. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will now take our first question from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Hubert Joly : Good morning Brian. Brian Nagel : First off, congratulations to everyone on their new roles. Very well deserved. Corie Barry : Thank you. Brian Nagel : So I wanted to ask you one question. I just want to talk about the lease-to-own please program, Hubert, you mentioned in your prepared comments, but you have started to roll this out now. I guess the question is, if you look at this program, how big could it be? And the consumer that you are serving with this, is it truly an incremental consumer to Best Buy? And how should we think about any financial implications to Best Buy from these sales? Corie Barry : Yes. So I will start and Hubert can pile on. I think what I would start with first is what we want to offer is a variety of customer purchase options. So I think that's really important and you know that. But I think it's important to start with, our branded credit card is already 25% of the business that we do. You can see that in any of our filings. So that's kind of our starting point in terms of customer purchase options. What we like then is adding Progressive on top of that because it's what you are digging at, there is another suite of customers who just might not be able to qualify for the branded cards or frankly might not want to and would like to look at something that's a little bit different. We are seeing so far that the customers that engage with this program do think of the incremental to Best Buy and so they are not customers who would be necessarily, for the most part, maybe seen before or haven't certainly seen in a while. And you heard in our prepared remarks, we have now rolled out to almost 700 stores, 689. So that's two-thirds right now. We are hoping that by the end of the year, we can go out to another nine states before holiday. And so that will get us significantly across our store base. We are not sizing it right now and because we are still rolling, we are learning a lot even as we roll. Like we said in our prepared remarks, we rolled halfway through the quarter. And one of the things we know for sure is that as the stores are on the program longer, they become more and more proficient around the program. And so you know, we like what we are seeing. We feel like we really are addressing a customer need, very in line with the strategy and that we are providing a whole another suite of purchase option and we will continue to see how it grows over time. Brian Nagel : Perfect. Thank you very much. And congratulations. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Joseph Feldman of Telsey. Joseph Feldman : Yes. Hi guys. Good morning and congratulations to everybody. I just wanted to ask, I noticed inventory was up a little bit. Is anything going on there that you can talk about? Maybe it's just bringing in goods ahead of the tariff list? Or just ready for the spring or anything with that? Corie Barry : Thank you Joe. A little bit more of the latter, honestly. Because if you think about when the tariffs going out, it was actually very close to the end of our quarter. And so this is really about us making sure we felt we have a good position heading into Memorial Day and then Father's Day and really light in a couple of spots last year. And so, as a team we had the opportunity to bring inventory to make sure we were well set. The other thing I would say, I am incredibly impressed by our merchant demand planning team and the health of the inventory is some of the best that we have ever seen. We have very low [indiscernible] left right now and we have been moving to the inventory nicely. So really nothing to read into there, just preparing for what is that string of kind of secondary holidays that happened during 2Q. Joseph Feldman : Got it. Thanks. And then, I know you mentioned that part of the SG&A maybe being up a little bit in the second quarter. You talked about ad expenses being a little higher. Is there a different strategy that you guys are employing this year ago to after some of those like Father's Day, graduation, holidays? Or what would be the reason for that? Corie Barry : Yes. I think we have liked so far what we have seen in some of our newer brand positioning. And you are absolutely right, if we are going to over-index in a quarter, Q2 makes a lot of sense given the string of secondary holidays we have. You have got Memorial Day. You have got Father's Day, the Fourth of July, even head into prime day later. And so you have got a whole string here and we feel like if we are going to over index and prefer a return on that spend, this is the right period of time for us to do it. And we can lift up some new and refreshed brand messaging. And so we felt like it is an important time of the year for us push a few more of our chips in on that. Joseph Feldman : That's helpful. Thanks and good luck with this quarter, guys. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Baker of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Please go ahead. Mr. Baker. Your line is open. It appears Mr. Baker has stepped away from the phone. We will go to our next question from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Hi. Good morning. Hubert, I have a feeling that my name gets like that. I think it happened on the first call that you did a long time ago. So my first question or I guess my only question is, anything surprised you about sales in the first quarter with regard to cadence, with regard to categories? And just drilling into the computing and mobile category, can we talk about laptops, desktop trends? And then anything with mobile as far as replacement rate, uptake in the category in general? Thank you. Corie Barry : So on the overall sales cadence, it actually played relatively closely to how we thought. If you remember, how we kind of set up the quarter we said, we felt like the consumer environment remains relatively favorable and I think most metrics would point to that continuing to be a good environment. We did have a little bit of pause around tax refunds that we mentioned. And if you remember, when we were into the quarter, refunds both quantity and amount were down about 40% and we said we were still gauging how much of that will come back. You ended up based on the IRS data with tax return total amount down about 2.4%. So we think that probably is like just a little bit of softness in this quarter, which again was kind of in line with how we guided for the quarter. And it is important to note, we also and we said we saw a softer than expected revenue in international. Now that's very much tied to the macro environment there. You can see that GDP is down in Canada and oil prices are struggling. And so you have got a bunch of things happening there that we think are more macro side. But in general, that wasn't anything that was an outlier. In terms of the computing and mobile business, I am going to take those a little bit separately. Computing, we kind of look at computing and tablets together. We talk about tablets as being an area of strength but it's a lot of the higher end, higher processing power, big gun kind of tablets which you can imagine you look at in light of computing. We didn't see a major change in trajectory there as we think about those categories together. A little bit more strength on the tablet side, a little bit less on the computing side. But we can see people making trade-offs between those two spaces. From our mobile perspective, that was actually just a slightly bit better than we thought it would be but it was still down year-over-year. And so again that's a category where we have said for a while, we kind of have some moderate expectations around growth there. It's definitely maturing and we continue to see a highly penetrated category, where there is a kind new reasons to buy. Simeon Gutman : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jonathan Matuszewski of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan Matuszewski : Great. Thanks for taking my question. So Total Tech Support seems to have some nice momentum lately in terms of enrollments and some healthy renewal rates based on our work. Could you just spend some time talking about the bigger picture here and the behavior of a typical Total Tech Support member since you rolled out the program acknowledging the fact that the initiative is still new? So when you are looking at the data, are you able to see a lift in the number of categories that these customers shop after joining or an increase in the number of visits to the store or better online engagement or anything along those trends? And I guess related to that, when do you typically see a ramp in any of these changes? Is it after they utilize the membership a few times or after they renew their membership or some other guidepost? Thanks. Corie Barry : Absolutely. So first, I am just going to take one step back and say, the most important thing around Total Tech Support is, we strategically like the relationship it helps us build with our customers. Now what's tricky is that we are just now lapping our nationwide rollout of Total Tech Support. So we are just starting to see in a larger quantity what do renewal rates look like, what does customer behavior look like over a year. And again, with us, it's a little trickier because our customers tend to have lower frequency overall than some other retailers. So it takes us a long way to figure out what are the longer term customer behavioral implications. We talked a little bit about it on the last call. We are definitely seeing nice usage upfront in the program. And renewal rates have stuck at the levels we thought they would. And so we are seeing usage in line with what we thought. We are seeing renewal rates in line with what we thought. We are seeing a ton of surprises but we just don't have a lot of data on yet is, is it pushing more purchase behavior, is it keeping people engaged with Best Buy longer. We just need a little bit longer on the program to be able to give you some more information and data around that. In terms of what we see when we try to ramp programs like this, as you can imagine, it's not just about ramping the program because that has proficiency implications with how we sell at the store. Our associates have done an amazing job really learning about this program and then helping customers see the true benefit of it. It's a very different service sale than anything we have done historically. And I think our associates have learned a lot over the last year and continue to just get better and better helping a customer understand why this would be perfect for them. I think the other thing that we are also behind the scene were continuously trying to improve the customer experience, both from a digital perspective, how I can sell, how I can see what I have, how I can look up how to repair something myself, but also importantly from how we help you, how we prioritize your service visits and how we make sure we are helping you in the moment as quickly as possible. And so I think you are going to continue to see a ramp in performance here and it's not just proficiency. It's also how do we continue to add customer value propositions behind the scene that makes us more and more palatable for customers as a way to stay engaged with Best Buy. Jonathan Matuszewski : Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Corie Barry : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Gregory Melich of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Gregory Melich : Great. Thanks Hubert. Thanks for everything over the years. And Corie, my congratulations, well deserved. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Gregory Melich : So no good dead goes unpunished. Thank you for the tariff information. If you were to look at List 4 now, what percentage of your COGS would that be? It was nice to have the 7% on the current list, but could you help us on that front? And then I have a follow-up. Corie Barry : So I think the trick with List 4 is that it hasn't actually, it hasn't been defined. It hasn't even got into place yet. There's a lot of discussions that Hubert alluded to in his opening statement around what exactly will be included on that list and when it will go into implementation. And so it's very difficult right now, given the amount of change that's happening in that list for us to size it at this point and we haven't come out yet with any sizing on that list. I think Hubert, you might have something to add. Hubert Joly : Yes. Greg, what I would highlight is that the administration is going to be going through a process of listening. And as said in my prepared remarks, no decision has been made. I think Secretary Mnuchin yesterday made a comment about the fact that he is going to be very attentive to the impact on consumers. So this is a complex discussion. No decision has been made. Even when decisions will be made, what rate will be applied, to what products, when, the when is going to be very important and then of course, we have always assumed that this negotiation process with China would not be linear. And so there is a meeting at the end of June and so rather than trying to forecast something, I think that our actions today are to be engaged in the discussion process. We would like to be as helpful as we can in support of the administration goals to minimize the impact on U.S. consumers. So expect us to be very active on this front in the future to be helpful. Gregory Melich : Yes. Maybe given your experience with the washing machine and laundry product tariffs, maybe take us through what you think, how that played out and the impact on consumers and any sort of demand response? If you can glean anything from that, that would be helpful. Corie Barry : Yes. So the appliances tariff is tricky, specifically washing machines and definitely the price increases were certainly, to begin with, passed on directly. Units did decline, but that impact was offset somewhat by higher prices. The hard part is, I would not try to drive comparisons with that category, because that's a category, you go buy a washing machine because of duress or need and it doesn't have the same elasticity as some of the other products that we sell. And so I don't think that's a great indicator of how behaviorally people will respond, especially at the different levels of 10% to 25%, I think you are going to end up with potentially some different consumer buying behaviors. Gregory Melich : And also across more categories, right, because ultimately people have to make decisions. All right. Okay. Thanks a lot and good luck to all of you and congrats. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Zach Fadem : Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to talk about the demand you have seen over the years for appliances, home theater, smart home, et cetera? And could you walk us through just how much of your business you believe is related or tied to housing? Whether you see that as a headwind today? And maybe talk about how you see home services fitting into this ecosystem? Thanks. Corie Barry : Yes. So actually, we have done some correlations with how it, we actually don't have a super high correlation to housing. Some of those individual categories might have a slightly higher correlation, but we don't tend to have a very large one in total. In terms of how we see services playing with those categories, definitely as we have grown larger TV and large appliances, we have seen services like installation, delivery, those type of services expands materially as we have been able to grow those businesses. And so I think even part of what you are seeing and the reason people like Total Tech Support is, it can help them with some of those delivery and installation experiences as they are buying these larger products. And so the nice part is, we haven't seen kind of correlations right now in our business to housing and we continue to see nice results in those categories. Hubert Joly : And what I would add, Corie, is it's above and beyond what the market does, which we continue to be very excited about and that's the essence of our strategy, the opportunity to deepen the relationships with our customers. We have highlighted at our Investor Day back in 2017 that our share of wallet of existing customers was around a quarter and a lot of the initiatives we have underway are designed to strengthen and deepen and broaden the relationship with these customers. And when you have a relatively low market share, which we think is our case, then you are excited about the upside from increasing that penetration which could very much outweigh any kind of short term situation in the underlying macro. Zach Fadem : I appreciate the color and congratulations as well. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Scott Mushkin : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a question on, I guess more of a two-part. Sales drivers, I want to talk about the back half of the year. How you guys are thinking of what can maybe move the needle as we get into back half? But then I want to think more long term and kind of looking out how we should view some of the strategic initiatives like GreatCall, CST, In-Home Advisor, Total Tech Support, the move to 5G in relation to kind of how you guys are thinking about your longer term sales growth rate? Thanks. Corie Barry : Yes. So we will start with the back half. Definitely, some of the consistent sales drivers that we have even seen coming in to the first part of the year here, we continue to see appliances as an ongoing opportunity for us and feel very well situated there. There continues to be interesting innovation in some of the other categories like what we are seeing in smart home and what we are even seeing in innovation. And you can see the different categories at different times. A new wave of tablets creates new interest. Some of the new in-home automation products creates new interest. Some of the new TV even evolutions, continued penetration in 4K and even the ability to see 8K and some of the new technologies, that continue to drive interest. And so I think this combination of continued strength in some of the underlying categories like appliances and then a continued evolution of technology in a few of the other categories, we continue to see a lot of interest in the products that we carry. Importantly, as we look ahead, I will spend just a moment on health. And we have said from day one, even when we had our Investor Day, health is a bit of a longer term value driver for us. But we absolutely like what we are starting to see in health. And if I just take you back for a second to why is it that we think we are uniquely well-positioned in this space and why is it that we built the relationship with GreatCall, I think importantly, number one, we have always said, we feel like it's very in line with our strategy. It addresses that key human need question around health and wellness. And in particular for us, when we are really trying to get pointed around our purpose, this is a very important purpose question around helping older Americans live a more independent life in their homes with the help of technology which aligns very well to what we are trying to accomplish overall. That space is exciting. There are 50 million people over 65 and that number is going to grow more than 50% in the next 20 years. And so you have a real population of people who would like to have some help. And then with GreatCall, we felt like we really acquired a great asset with already 900,000 members and already a good profitable business. I think importantly, between the two companies now what we are seeing is that, we jointly bring to life a number of really interesting value creation opportunities. We are the only place that has that a nationwide footprint of in-home capabilities around technology as well as importantly the support backbone that keep those things running over time. We are agnostic across ecosystems. So we will help you with whatever technology you already have or whatever technology you want to put in. And as we bring on GreatCall's assets, their ability to help us with the human touch combined with more predictive analytics, it becomes very powerful because then you not only start to see major medical events might happen, but we have some of that human intervention that also is helpful. And so I think we are continuing to build on that thesis and I think you can hear us every time we talk to, we get a little bit more clear about the space that we play in that we feel like no one else can. That being said, it's going to take us some time to continue to build the capabilities and then to build the footprint. Right now we just have a few small kind of publicly announced partnerships with Senior Whole Health of Massachusetts and long-term care insurance of CNA, which is one of the largest U.S. commercial property and casualty insurance companies. So those are couple of small proof points and we are going to continue to try to build on those over time. I think that's likely a longer term thesis for us, but a very exciting one in terms of a unique space where we have capabilities. As I think about other growth mechanisms like 5G, I might actually turn it over to Mike and ask him to add a little color to what we think that could do for us. Mike Mohan : Hi Scott, it's Mike. You brought up IHA and 5G and they both apply in different ways, but we think there's some good excitement. I will start with IHA. We already know it's an incremental part to our business and it just helps us build a deeper relationship with our customers and expand the share of wallet. And so as I look at that going forward, it's an area we think we just started, we are in the first few innings of what that could look like to drive a longer and deeper relationships with customers across a whole host of products and services. When I think about 5G, it's a place where we are really in a good spot to help our carrier partners and OEMs bring new technology solutions to life, because this one's being roll out market by market and you are going to need an environment where you can actually get into people's homes, get into people's businesses with qualified and trained teams and then use our stores for opportunities to showcase what's possible with a higher network speed. So we are optimistic about it. It's just starting and we think it's going to be a great journey to be participating. Hubert Joly : And then of course in terms of specific numbers, that's why we have this meeting in September in Q3, where the team will have the opportunity to try to update long term prospects and that's something we had announced on our call at the end of February. Scott Mushkin : Great guys. I look forward to the meeting. It sounds like we could see some sales acceleration. So I do look forward to the meeting. And I offer my congratulations too. It's just a wonderful group of people and look forward to the next chapter. Thanks. Hubert Joly : Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Unfortunately, I do have another tariff question. Corie, you have highlighted that tariffs were expected to impact about 7% of your COGS. I guess what I am trying to figure out is, of that 7% exposure, can you help us understand how much of your mitigation process was handled or managed through vendor negotiation basically pushing that price increase, if you will, back on to vendors? And how much was handled through you guys having to increase prices, just so we can kind of think about how the forward tariffs may work? Thanks. Corie Barry : Yes. So I will try to give some color. We talked last time about some of the ways that we are going to try to mitigate tariff. And we broke that into a few buckets. In some cases, we obviously have worldwide vendors, who might make some decisions to push that across their whole worldwide business. In some cases, we also know that we have vendors who would absorb costs as a way to retain some of the business. And then in some cases, we have people are already moving supply chains, moving the business around, finding other ways to bring things. And then finally, there is the question of increasing cost. I think what's difficult is at 10% for that List 3, you have a much greater ability to influence using a variety of methods and even the absorbing method becomes easier because at 10% and you are not sure if it's an extended period of time or a limited period of time, you might be willing to absorb that. As you move to 25%, the discussion becomes quite different because there is a much lower likelihood that you can absorb that as a vendor completely and you have to really think differently about how quickly you can actually move your distribution. And it takes longer in the consumer electronic space. And so I wouldn't say that what we have seen in the 10% where I think we haven't seen as much of an impact is applicable to the 25%, Hubert said at the prepared remarks, at 25% level, there will be higher prices for consumers. Now it's tricky and I think you have heard it from variety of retailers is figuring out SKU by SKU, vendor by vendor which of those tactics are going to work and which aren't and then how that will actually play into the back half. So that's the work the team is doing and definitely we did our very best to try to size it. But there's still a lot of work to do there. Hubert Joly : And I certainly want to comment the skills of our merchant teams. Of course, given the size of the U.S. market, size of Best Buy in those markets, these teams do a wonderful job of navigating these waters and that's one of the, when I talked about the depths and breadth of talent at the company, that's clearly one of the areas where we have wonderful assets. And looking at the clock and this is not only my last call as CEO, but the last minutes of my last call as CEO and before we have to call it, I will quickly say this, I am clearly passing the baton, which is a French word, to Corie and our team with a very happy and full heart and with a strong conviction that the right team is in place for this pivotal moment in Best Buy's history and I very much look forward to watching Corie and her team do their magic. And so my thanks to all of you. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session and this concludes today's call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 01 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the Company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company\u2019s current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported $9.54 billion in revenue, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 20 basis points, and delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.08, which was up 19% compared to the second quarter of last year. Our comparable sales growth of 1.6% was on top of a very strong 6.2% last year and within our guidance range for the quarter. The international segment comparable sales declined 1.9%, driven primarily by continued soft macroeconomic conditions in Canada. Our domestic segment comparable sales were up 1.9% as we continue to drive the customer experience across online, stores and home. From a product category standpoint, the comparable sales were buoyed by strength in appliances, tablets and headphones, personally offset by declines in gaming and home theater. The Q2 profitability was better than expected, primarily driven by strong expense management. This points to the culture we have built around driving cost reduction and efficiencies to help fund investments and offset pressures. Before, I talk about the progress we have made on our Building the New Blue strategy and our continued excitement about our strategic opportunities, I would like to address the latest development on the topic of tariff. As you know, since our last earnings call, the administration finalized the products on List 4 and the timing of their implementation. We were a very active participant in the official comment process, and we are pleased, the administration decided to delay the effective date of many of the products on the List until December 15th. We believe this will mitigate some of the impact of higher prices for American consumers during the holiday season. So, List 4 tariffs are at a 15% level and have two effective dates. The first effective date is September 1st, and the most notable affected categories relative to Best Buy are televisions, smart watches and headphones. The second effective date is December 15th and the most notable categories relative to Best Buy are computing, mobile phones and gaming consoles. Given the trends, many of our vendors are in the process of migrating their manufacturing out of China. Our merchants are also addressing this new contest, with a view to minimize costs and risks while continuing to offer exciting technology products and solutions to our customers. As a result, while there will be some short-term volatility, we expect to adapt to this new environment. Let me say a few words about the updated annual fiscal \u201820 guidance we are providing today, and that Matt will expand on later in the call. On the topline, we narrowed the revenue range; on bottom-line, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range. This reflects the continued momentum of our strategic initiatives. It also includes our best estimate of the impact from the List 4 tariffs and the most recent announcement regarding List 3 moving to a 30% rate, net of the actions we are taking to mitigate their impact, including bringing in products ahead of the tariff implementation, decisions around vendor and SKU assortment, promotional and pricing strategies, sourcing changes and other strategies employed in partnership with our vendors. As others have noted, it is difficult to factor in the uncertainty related to overall customer buying behavior. It is hard to predict how at the macro level consumers will react to higher prices resulting from tariffs. As you would imagine, the general overall volatility in the financial markets adds a level of caution to our outlook. This is a rapidly evolving situation and our teams are doing an excellent job adapting on a daily basis. As we have said before, we are supportive of free and fair trade between the U.S. and China, and appreciate the delay on many products. And we\u2019re actively engaged in mitigation efforts to minimize the impact on consumers and our business. The tariffs do not change our excitement about our strategic opportunities, however. And I would now like to talk about the progress we are making on our Building the New Blue strategy. An example of our growing commitment to health, during Q2, we launched a new collection of connected fitness products from some of the world\u2019s most innovative exercise companies, including Hydrow, ProForm, Hyperice and NordicTrack. This new assortment includes a range of connected bikes and rowing machines and recovery system loved by many pro athletes. The collection is available now on bestbuy.com with a new dedicated fitness space coming to more than 100 stores by the end of the year. Our store employees and In-Home Advisors will receive special training to help customers discover, understand and purchase the equipment, whether in a store or in their home. And Best Buy and Geek Squad will manage delivery and installation. Meanwhile, we continue to make progress both in terms of scaling the GreatCall consumer devices and services, and advancing our commercial monitoring service with a focus on aging seniors. Last quarter, we updated you on our acquisition of a senior focused health services company called Critical Signal Technologies or CST, to help more quickly scale the commercial monitoring business. Earlier this month, we acquired the predictive healthcare technology business of BioSensics, including the hiring of the Company\u2019s data science and engineering team based in Watertown, Massachusetts. These talented employees drive innovation through wearable sensor technology that addresses some of the biggest challenges faced by the aging population, such as falls. These tuck-in acquisitions together with GreatCall, complement our existing capabilities like Geek Squad and In-Home Advisors to better help seniors live longer in their homes, help reduce their healthcare costs, and bring greater peace of mind for their families and caregivers. We look forward to spending more time on our health strategy at our Investor update next month. Speaking of Geek Squad, during Q2, we continued to expand our Total Tech Support program, which provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all their technology, no matter where or when they bought it. We grew the member base at a steady rate while executing on our roadmap to continually improve the customer experience. Additionally, Best Buy is now fully certified chain-wide as an Apple authorized service provider, becoming the nation\u2019s largest physical destination for Apple authorized repair services, including same day iPhone repairs. Nearly 10,000 of our Geek Squad agents have completed training for all Apple device repairs. And all of our nearly 1,000 stores are equipped with Apple authorized repair tools and parts. As you would imagine, consumers can schedule their repair by going to bestbuy.com, but what you might not know is that they can also go to Apple\u2019s own website to schedule a repair at Best Buy. More than 200 Best Buy stores across the U.S. have been Apple authorized service providers since 2017 and have enjoyed strong customer satisfaction scores. So, we are pleased to expand that partnership with Apple to provide even more consumers with convenient access to safe and reliable repairs. And it drives traffic. Almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or reengaged Best Buy customers. This is another great example of something we can do with our vendor partners that others cannot. In addition to tech services, we provide our customers with a number of financing options that help them acquire the products they need and also create stickiness over time with our brand. For example, sales transacted on our Best Buy credit card were 25% of total sales last year, and that number is growing. We always offer customers our branded credit card first. However, there are people who may not be interested in getting a credit card or are unable to qualify for it because of low credit scores, or in many cases, simply no credit history. And that\u2019s where our new lease-to-own program comes in. Throughout the second quarter, we continued to see customers use lease-to-own to acquire products across a wide variety of categories, with the largest being computing. We also continued to see a significant number of customers take advantage of the 90-day purchase option, which consists of an additional payment plus the retail price. Later this quarter, we expect to launch lease-to-own in nine more states, including California and New York, which will complete our full 45-state rollout. We believe that this program will build over time as our associates continue to get up to speed on the offer, consumer awareness if it grows and as we enhance the customer experience, both in our stores and online. As we continue to implement these important customer-facing initiatives, we\u2019re also taking steps to evolve our retail model. In Q2, we made strategic changes to our field operations, to accelerate growth, and to create a more seamless customer experience across all channels. We did this because we know that customers interact with us across all channels, but at times, it can be confusing or repetitive for them to navigate Best Buy as we were organized. At the same time, as we look at our penetration by geographic market, we see that it varies wildly, yet our tools and structure have been one size fits all for our local markets. So, we have reengineered retail in a way that puts the customer at the center and empowers the local leaders to serve their customers in ways that best suit them and take advantage of local opportunities. We have put single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain and home propositions in their market. We believe these changes will simplify processes and allow us to seize growth opportunities within individual markets. It will also create an environment for our employees to grow and allow our teams to collaborate more effectively and efficiently in service of our customers. One of the opportunities we continue to be the most excited about is home where we continue to increase the number of In-Home Advisors to meet consumer demand, and expect to be at around 700 advisors at year-end. With the changes we made to our operating model, there is more local leadership support to deepen the advisors development, customer expertise and performance. And we are focused on a seamless customer experience in the home, no matter how it\u2019s delivered. We also continue to focus on developing digital innovation and marketing strategies to drive engagement with our customers. For example, for back-to-school, we are integrating influencers and YouTube into our advertising in an interactive way. Also this year, we have increased our use of digital videos that feature real life Best Buy associates, providing authentic tech insights. These videos celebrate the passion, expertise and knowledge of our people, highlighting the role they play as inspiring friends for our customers. This is driving increased trust among viewers, and the highest unique viewers and watch times we\u2019ve seen across our YouTube channel. From a digital innovation standpoint, starting with the Samsung Note 10 launch, bestbuy.com launched the ability for customers to trade in their old phone to purchase a new one, something that was previously only available in physical stores. Since we have expanded this to a multichannel capability, a customer can put the full traded value of their previous phone towards the purchase of a new device instantly, thus improving the customer experience regardless of the channel. To improve the home theater shopping experience in the app, we launched augmented reality capabilities that can help customers select the right TV. This new capability allows customers to place three dimensional virtual TVs that are correctly scaled to size on a wall or table. This feature is driving higher customer confidence in choosing the right screen size and as a result, higher conversion, and we expect to also reduce returns. Supply chain is also an area where we have strong momentum. Since our last earnings call, we have automated three additional distribution centers across the country. And we will go live with another automated facility prior to the holiday season. We also relocated one of our local distribution centers to a larger facility to support our growth in major appliances. These changes support our strategy to offer enhanced speed of delivery to customers. As we have shared previously, we offer same-day delivery on thousands of items in 40 metro areas. And while same-day delivery is an important offer, we have found that our customers really value two things : They want free delivery and many want to be able to get it the next day. We offer next day delivery for thousands of products in 64 metro areas that reach 80% of Best Buy customers. This is free for orders over $35 and does not require a membership fee. Of course, you all know that we also provide our customers the extremely convenient option to pick up their products at one of our nearly 1,000 stores. What you may not realize is that we promise their items to be ready within one hour of placing their order and on average, those orders are ready within just 40 minutes. We also continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and help offset pressures. During the second quarter, we achieved $155 million in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies, bringing the cumulative total to $730 million since Q2 fiscal 2018. This is toward our fiscal 2021 goal of $600 million. So, we\u2019ve not only exceeded our goal, we did it over a year early. We have now successfully delivered on three considerable cost reduction targets in the last seven years, totaling more than $2 billion. We plan to provide a new long-term cost reduction and efficiency target at our Investor Update next month. In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the first half of the year. And we\u2019re excited about the long-term opportunities ahead of us as we continue to make great progress on our Building the New Blue strategy. I want to thank our associates across the Company for their hard work and dedication every day to help deliver on our purpose to enrich lives through technology. At Best Buy, we strive to be a purposeful, value-driven human organization. With that in mind, we are very proud of the recognition we have received in recent months for being a top employer. We ranked number seven on Forbes list of America\u2019s best employers for women and for the first time earned a spot on the Indeed\u2019s list of the 50 top-rated workplaces. We were also named a best place to work for disability inclusion. And we are changing the world together as noted by Fortune magazine, which recently included us on its Change the World List. This list recognizes companies for using their business strategy and operations to make a positive human, social or environmental impact. All of these awards underscore our mission, which is to build a purposeful company that does good things for the world and great things for all our stakeholders. Now, before I turn the call over to him, I would first like to say a few words about our new CFO, Matt Bilunas. For obvious reasons, the search for a new CFO was a personal one. First, I was picking the person to take my old job and run a functioning and team I know and love. And second, any CEO will tell you that a strong finance partner is critical to their personal success and the success of the Company they lead. I worked closely with Matt for more than a decade. I trust him and I\u2019m completely confident that his experience, skills and commitment to the Company\u2019s continued growth make him the perfect choice for this role. I will now turn the call over to Matt. Matt Bilunas : Thanks, Corie. Good morning, and hello, everyone. It\u2019s a huge honor to be given the opportunity to help lead this Company forward as CFO. We have made tremendous progress in how we enrich people\u2019s lives through technology, and I am confident we will continue to build even deeper relationships with our customers as we serve them online, in stores and in their homes. During my 13 years at Best Buy, I\u2019ve had the benefit of being in the field, working with the international team, and leading financial planning and analysis teams during the turnaround effort. Now, I\u2019m excited to lead our world class finance organization, which has been instrumental to our success here at Best Buy. Now, on to Q2 financial details. Let me begin by talking about our results versus expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $9.54 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.08. EPS results exceeded our expectations and our revenue performance was near the midpoint of our guidance range. Our operating income rate exceeded our expectations, primarily due to strong expense management. A lower effective tax rate also provided a benefit of approximately $0.02 versus our earnings per share guidance. I will now talk about our second quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.7% to $9.54 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.6%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.17, or 19% to $1.08. This increase was driven by one, increased operating income dollars from both the higher operating income rate and higher revenue; two, a $0.05 per share benefit from the net share count change; and three, a $0.04 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate. In our domestic segment, revenue increased 2.1% to $8.82 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 1.9% and revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October 2018, partially offset by the loss of revenue from 13 format store closure -- large format store closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances, which includes both majors and small appliances, tablets and headphones. These drivers were partially offset by declines in our gaming and home theater categories. In addition, comparable sales in the services category increased 10.7% versus last year. Part of the growth was due to the refinement of revenue recognition for our Total Tech Support offer. In Q4 fiscal 2019, we refined the revenue recognition for a Total Tech Support offer because we had sufficient history of member utilization to move from recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the membership contract to recognizing revenue on a usage basis, therefore better matching the fulfillment costs with revenue. This results in more of the annual fee being recognized upfront as the customer usage of the program is heaviest when they first become members. This refinement of revenue recognition impacts new contracts created since the start of our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter on a prospective basis. Domestic online revenue of $1.42 billion was 16.1% of domestic revenue, up from 14% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 17.3% on top of 10.1% growth in the second quarter of last year, which was primarily driven by higher average order values and increased traffic. In our international segment, revenue decreased 3.4% to $715 million. This was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and approximately 120 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The comparable sales decline was driven by Canada and was partially offset by comparable sales in Mexico. Turning now to gross profit. The enterprise gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 23.9%. The domestic gross profit rate was 24% versus 23.8% last year. The 20 basis-point increase was primarily driven by the impact of GreatCall\u2019s higher gross profit rate, which was partially offset by higher supply chain costs. International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 23.8%, primarily due to a higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which was driven by higher margin from the services category. Now, turning to SG&A. Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A was $1.9 billion, or 19.9% of revenue, which increased $24 million and decreased 10 basis points to last year as a percentage of revenue. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.74 billion or 19.7% of revenue versus 19.8% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars increased $23 million due to GreatCall\u2019s operating expenses and higher advertising expense, which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense versus last year. International SG&A was $166 million, or 23.2% of revenue versus $165 million or 22.3% of revenue last year. The $1 million increase included an impairment charge for discontinued technology in Canada, which was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. During the quarter, we recorded $48 million of restructuring charges, the majority of which was driven by a retail operating model change as Corie mentioned earlier. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 22.8%, compared to 25.4% last year. The favorability versus last year was primarily driven by a larger tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and a favorable resolution of certain tax matters. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of CST, which was funded with approximately $125 million of existing cash. The acquisition of CST is not expected to have a material impact on our revenue or non-GAAP operating income this fiscal year. We returned a total of $363 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $230 million and dividends of $133 million. Our regular quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share was an increase of 11% compared to prior year. As we previously announced, we still intend to spend between $750 million and $1 billion on share repurchases in fiscal 2020. Finally, we now expect the capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. Lastly, I will discuss our outlook. Our outlook reflects the strong earnings performance in the first half of the year, as well as our best estimate of the tariff impacts and consumer buying behaviors in a very fluid environment. To be clear, the guidance we are providing today incorporates the estimated impact of the List 4 tariffs that Corie described and also includes our assumptions related to List 3 moving from a 25% to a 30% tariff rate. Specifically, for the full year, we now expect enterprise revenue in the range of $43.1 billion to $43.6 billion and enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.7% to 1.7%. As a reminder, this top-line growth expectation is on top of the best two-year stack in 14 years and reflects factor such as the anticipated cyclical slowdown of the traditional console gaming category and the continued maturation of the mobile phone category. We expect our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate to be flat to slightly up to fiscal 2019\u2019s rate of 4.6%, reflecting our continued focus on balancing investments in our strategy, pressures in the business and efficiencies. We expect our non-GAAP effective income tax rate to be approximately 24% and our non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range with the $5.60 to $5.75, which compares to our previous guidance $5.45 to $5.65. I would like to share a few of the assumptions reflected in our annual guidance. Consistent with the outlook we provided at the beginning of the year, we expect both gross profit and SG&A dollars to be approximately flat to last year as a percentage of revenue for the full year. As a reminder, we have also shared there would be variations between the quarters. Our guidance today implies a higher year-over-year operating income rate in Q3 and a lower operating income rate in Q4. A lower year-over-year operating rate in Q4 was assumed in the original guidance we provided at the start of the year and now also includes the tariff changes we have discussed today. For the third quarter specifically, we are expecting the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $9.65 billion to $9.75 billion; enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.5% to 1.5%; non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1 to $1.05; non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 26.5%l and the diluted weighted average share count of approximately 267 million shares. I would like to provide additional items of color for Q3. We expect our Q3 gross profit rate to expand versus last year. We expect the gross profit rate expansion to be higher than the year-over-year increase we reported in Q2. We also expect our SG&A dollars to grow as a percentage in the very low single digits. At this time, we do not expect the recent tariff announcements to have much of an impact on our Q3 performance. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Katie McShane of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Kate McShane : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations, Corie and Matt. I wanted just to ask about the supply chain costs that were noted in the gross margin discussion. Could you go into any more detail about what drove that during the quarter? Corie Barry : Yes. So, there\u2019s a couple of things that sit under that. And they\u2019ve been pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter. First, the first piece that is just overarchingly a little bit more spend, especially when it comes to some of our large cube and the growth that we\u2019ve seen, frankly, online where we\u2019ve been investing in speed. The second part of that is more the strategic side of the investments that we started talking about at our Investor Day two years ago. And we\u2019ve been putting some capital into, especially as it relates to things we talked about today, around automating some of those metro ecommerce centers, and around investing in some of the incremental facilities that we need in order to support the large cube growth that we\u2019ve seen. So, you\u2019ve got a little bit of both things, both just systemically the higher volumes, and then secondarily, the more strategic investments, hence the reason we talked about those continuing throughout the rest of the year here. Kate McShane : Okay, great. And if I could just ask one follow-up about your guidance and the narrowing of the range on the top line. Could you talk about what\u2019s a little bit better than expected on the low end of that, and is the lowering of the top line exclusively tariff related? Matt Bilunas : Yes. Thanks for the question. So, for guidance purposes, I think what we\u2019re looking at for the rest of this year, one of the things that sequentially changes from the first part this year is a little bit more of a drag from the gaming category that we saw in the first part of the year. So, gaming was quite bit stronger in Q3 and Q4 of last year. And so, we are seeing a bit of -- a bit more weighted impact from that business being expected to be down a little bit more in the back half of this year. That\u2019s the biggest sequential probably change going forward as we look towards the back half of the year. Corie Barry : And to answer the other part of your question, Kate. The tariff impact is built in there; it is not exclusively related to the tariff impact. This is just taking into account some of the trends that Matt\u2019s talking about as well as some of our estimates around the impact of tariff. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Keith of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Peter Keith : I did want to follow up on the tariff question. So, you provided a lot of good detail. But, I guess, I wanted to understand the approach that you\u2019re thinking about for pricing, because presumably, there may not be that many price increases in calendar year \u201819, but there could be a lot more to come in 2020. So, maybe strategically, do you think that a fair share of items will see price increases? And how do you think about the sort of the portfolio approach to managing through that? Corie Barry : Yes. This is the most difficult place for us to make projections. I think, you understand better than anyone, and there\u2019s a bit of art and a bit of science to estimating this. And we don\u2019t exactly have a precedence for the quantity of moving pieces that we have in place right now. There\u2019s a few things we\u2019re trying to take into account here. So, first, you know this is -- there\u2019s a lot of changes still going on in terms of what exactly is on the List, when they\u2019re implemented and at what rate. And there\u2019s even some public comments around potentially some vendors being exempted. And so, we\u2019re watching that but there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s moving there. Second, as we\u2019ve already seen, we believe many vendors are going to continue to migrate their manufacturing out of China. And so, we think the total prospect of business that\u2019s impacted is going to be materially less, even just next year, because you\u2019re seeing those supply chains already start to move. And then, third, the impacted -- what we think is really impacted in our business is actually substantially less than the overarching quantity that is affected by tariffs, meaning our teams are doing really excellent work. We talked about it in prepared remakes, with mitigating strategies to help offset some of the impacts here. And so, the piece that\u2019s impacted is actually substantially smaller than the overall affected quantity of SKUs. And so, we\u2019re working to understand what that looks like into next year. But, to get precise around exactly where it\u2019s going to result in price increases, where the promotional environment will land because we\u2019re only going to stay price competitive, and how that actually shows up next year, it\u2019s going to still take us some work from here. Peter Keith : And then, separately, maybe looking out to next year and contemplating some near-term headwinds around gaming and mobile. I was hoping you could talk about some of the technology innovations that you see evolving over the next one to two years, and thinking specifically around 5G, 8K TVs, and potentially a new console cycle. If you have any thoughts on how that may impact your business? Mike Mohan : Peter, it\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. It might be a little too early to give you specifics on those categories. But we\u2019re excited about all of them. And I think about what Corie talked about and how we\u2019ve realigned our field structure to support our markets. And that gives us an opportunity, as technology needs to be either showcased in the store environment or actually in people\u2019s homes to leverage more resources and be able to have Best Buy partner with whomever it may be in this case with 5G; it\u2019s our carrier to show what the technology can do well beyond what it would do on a phone like it is today. We\u2019re quite excited about where the evolution in TVs is going because it plays into where Best Buy is historically done best showcasing technology and making sure we can get product to customers\u2019 homes. And while gaming is a drag this year, every time we\u2019ve had a new console cycle, our ability to get products in consumers\u2019 hands in a way that matters to them and support them with solutions, and now in this case with Total Tech Support has us quite excited. But, we\u2019ll probably give a bit more color on those technologies as we get into our fiscal \u201821 guide. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Chris Horvers : So, I wanted to follow up on the guidance question a little bit more. So, just to think about it, you beat about $0.27 year-to-date, guided up 3Q about $0.08 and raised the year $0.10 to $0.15. So, it seems like you\u2019re lowering the fourth quarter, I guess implied versus the Street by $0.20 to $0.25. Is that accurate? And I know you talked about the gaming headwinds and the tariff. But, maybe you could talk, maybe break that down a little bit more. Was the gaming headwind that you\u2019re now assuming, presumably most acute to 4Q, sort of how much do you assume comp might benefit from an AUR perspective as prices go up? And then, on the margin line, gaming being worse, I would think would be better from a gross margin perspective. But, obviously you have the tariffs. So, I know, it\u2019s a very specific question, but really trying to understand how you thought about the fourth quarter update? Corie Barry : Yes. I\u2019ll start, and then Matt can follow. What I\u2019m saying, first of all, is, the general cadence of the year is flowing exactly how we expected it. And so, that\u2019s good. And I think your estimate on that 20% -- or $0.20 plus, taking it down is on the high side. Because we saw early in the year, there would be some pressure to Q4. Matt will go into that a little bit. But, what I think overarchingly, what I would say is, it\u2019s less of a takedown than that. And it\u2019s more of what we were talking about before, us just trying to do our best to estimate what we think -- with all the mitigation strategies, what we think some of the implications might be in Q4, which we said on the call is a bit of a moving target. Matt, maybe you can provide some more color on what we see going into the year. Matt Bilunas : Absolutely. So, Q4 lower rate is largely being driven by number of items we contemplated in the original guidance. It\u2019s primarily result of lower gross profit rate, compared to last year. And there are a number of factors that are driving that. But first, it might be helpful to point out, for the last three quarters, we\u2019ve been seeing some sources of expansion that will lap in Q4 this year. The first one is the revenue recognition refinement to Total Tech Support offer last Q4. That\u2019s been expanding our margins a little bit since Q4 last year. The second is the acquisition of GreatCall, which we completed October last year, and we cycle that in Q4 of this year. So, that won\u2019t be a source of expansion. And on top of that, what we\u2019re seeing is slightly lower product margin rates in Q4. We\u2019re giving the teams a little bit of flexibility. It\u2019s important for them to have some to navigate through the holiday period. So, product rates are down a little bit in Q4. The second source of a little bit more pressure that we contemplated already was the services category. We\u2019re seeing -- we know we have a reduced profit share in Q4, because we had one last Q4. The other is in the area of supply, delivery and install where we\u2019re seeing a higher volume of large product that requires a little more install costs and delivery costs. And lastly, we knew that supply chain costs would continue to be a drag year-on-year in Q4. They\u2019re a little more of a drag in Q4 than they are going to be in Q3. Again, all of those things were contemplated as we went into the guidance at the beginning of the year. The one thing we did add was the expectation of the tariff impact, which Corie mentioned. So, that would be the new thing that we put in. But, we knew most of that pressure was coming when we started the year. Chris Horvers : And then, as a follow-up, the gross margin in Canada was very strong here in the third quarter, and presumably this is the maturation of the services model in that market, which I believe was ahead of the U.S. So, what does this tell us about the gross margin tailwinds that you might see as you get into 2020 in the domestic business, given that I think it is lagging from a rollout perspective? Corie Barry : So, first, I want to reinforce what you said, which is definitely we\u2019re seeing Canada lap now a few years of having their version of what we call Total Tech Support. But their version is quite different. So, I want to be clear about that. They -- and we\u2019ve talked about this before. They started with different models than we have. In their case, most often, it\u2019s an offer that includes a warranty proposition with it, but also has support across the business. It\u2019s offered a little bit differently by category. So, I wouldn\u2019t say exactly what they\u2019re seeing is going to be perfectly replicated in the U.S. because we\u2019re looking at more of a pure support offer. But, at the same, time, we like what we\u2019re seeing there. We\u2019re trying to learn from what they\u2019re doing in Canada, and at the same time, figure out what\u2019s right for our customers. Obviously, we\u2019re not dying next year yet. But, like we said in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re happy with the ramp in TTS. And the best news is our customers clearly value having support across their devices, whether they bought them from us or somewhere else. And so that frankly, and the stickiness of those customers is what\u2019s most important to us here in the U.S. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba of Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Anthony Chukumba : Corie, you provided a little bit of color on rent-to-own including the fact it\u2019s going to be I guess rolled out to an additional nine states. Any color you can provide in terms of the comp lift from rent-to-own? I mean, was it material in the second quarter, and what are your expectations for that comp lift as the year progresses? Corie Barry : Yes. So, what I\u2019d start with is that we said it last time, we\u2019re going to consistently say it, this is a great offer. It\u2019s great for our brand. It\u2019s great for our customers. And I think we said it out on the prepared remarks, financing options for our customers is really important. 25% of the business is done on our own branded card. You can see that it\u2019s important to have options. We always start with the Best Buy credit card, but now we have something additional that is available to customers who either might not want that as an option, or might not qualify. Lease-to-own is having a positive impact on our comps, but we\u2019re not going to show the exact details. And the reason is because this is a program we would expect to build over time. We\u2019re still really early in this one. I mean, we\u2019re only into the first quarter of having it rolled out into two thirds of our stores. Over time, we think our sales associates will get more and more comfortable with the offering for our customers. We think customer awareness will continue to increase. We need to continue to implement some experience improvements. And ideally, we want to make this available online next year, as well as obviously very important to have a digital offering. And then, to your point, we still have nine states to go, two of those being California and New York, some big ones. So, like we expected, we\u2019re definitely still seeing a number of customers use this program who are either new to Best Buy or that we haven\u2019t seen for a while. And so, we continue to like that. We\u2019ll give a little bit more color on this one at the Investor Update next month. But, in general, we definitely like how it\u2019s ramping and piecing. And most importantly, it\u2019s something that our customers seem to like. And the feedback we get from our associates is also that it\u2019s really nice to have this as a secondary financing option. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : Presumably you had existing purchase orders in place for your holiday product prior to when these tariffs are going to come in and your vendors are the importer of record. So, are you going to be sharing in the actual tariff impact, given those dynamics? And if so, can you quantify what the price increase you -- contribution you\u2019ve factored into your fourth quarter comp guidance? It looks like the domestic segment in the 1% to 2% range. And then, as part of that, how has the elasticity of the laundry equipment business that did see some tariffs earlier, informed your view on how this whole situation is going to unfold? Thank you very much. Mike Mohan : Hey, Michael. It\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll start and then maybe Corie can chime in. When I look at -- to answer to your first question, yes, with all of our vendors, we have existing purchase orders forecast commitments and contracts around what we pay for items and how we bring them into the country. To give you color on what might be changing, it will be far too soon to tell you that because some of the stuff\u2019s already been on the water, some of the stuff\u2019s actually in the U.S., some of the stuff may not have price increases, some of these items may evolve to different models before there\u2019s any really significant price impact, whether they get sourced from another factory outside of China, or really wrap to something else that\u2019s got a different feature set that would warrant a price increase. So, as we tried to explain in our prepared remarks, it\u2019s very, very fluid as to what we\u2019re doing. The one thing I would probably leave you with on that point is the significance that Best Buy plays in the overall consumer electronics market worldwide, does give us more leverage than I think -- than we can probably explain on a call like this. But, it gives us exposure, because of where we source merchandise from, the ability to get to customers with the newest technology that create the right buying cycles is really important. And we\u2019re working with every one of our partners from where they source. Well, they\u2019re the importer of record, as you noted, to mitigate any impact to consumers on pricing and to us. On a comment around appliances, there\u2019s very little to draw from that, and I\u2019ll let Corie add anything in between. Given we\u2019ve been living with price increases from a variety of reasons for the last almost two years, that category is very driven to duress and replacement. And there\u2019s a different elasticity when you\u2019re not trying to drive demand for a natural purchase. So, we\u2019ve got good understanding, but it doesn\u2019t apply a lot of go forward logic here. So, Corie? Corie Barry : Yes. What\u2019s really tricky, and we started on it with the earlier question. I mean, we think that of our total cost of goods sold about 60% comes from China. But, it\u2019s a massively smaller portion of that that is actually, we think affected by the tariffs because of some of the negotiating power, because of the mitigating strategies that we\u2019re putting in place. To your point about price elasticity, Q4 is also a really different quarter. I mean, keep in mind, this is a very promotional quarter and we will always be price competitive. So, the team is working through what stands from prior history of price elasticity, a little bit different in Q4. So, to Mike\u2019s point, we\u2019ve got a team who\u2019s working with our vendors, doing a really excellent job with the various mitigating strategies that they have in place, and then frankly, positioning us for the holiday really well. Michael Lasser : Thank you. My follow-up question is on the Progressive situation. It seemed like that\u2019s gaining a good amount of traction, given all the comments that you\u2019ve made. Would your domestic comps have been positive without the Progressive relationship? Corie Barry : We\u2019re not going to give the exact comps for Progressive, like we said before, and because mainly it\u2019s really early. We\u2019re still ramping. We\u2019re learning a lot. And ideally, over time, we continue to see better and better results from that. Operator : Our next question comes from Ray Stochel of Consumers Edge Research. Ray Stochel : How do you think about your TV assortment now versus prior years? A couple points on that would be different approaches your vendors are taking on smart TVs and as a result over the top services. And then, how do you think about your TV supply chain and product mix compared to others in terms of geographical sourcing around tariffs? Thanks. Mike Mohan : Hey, Ray. It\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. I feel very good, to answer your question about our TV assortment, now versus prior years. Best Buy has a history of leading innovation in this space, whether it\u2019s the connectivity of the device, the technology in the screen, or what size the TV is, and those are the three factors, I think people are looking at the most. Interestingly, as more people look for solutions with streaming services, I would hope you would see that by taking a leading role, helping explain what people can do that you didn\u2019t think was possible. And getting a unified experience across multiple steps in their homes or finding ways to perhaps save some money. And we\u2019re working on ideas that can take advantage of the fact that 25% of our customers use the Best Buy credit card, and how can you blend the fact that we can help making buying device easier, perhaps with what you want to do with it. So, I\u2019ll stop the comment with that there. When I think about our TV supply chain, yes, TVs are impacted on List 4A. Those are specifically TVs that are sourced out of China. And so, just as a reminder for the group listening that a bulk of Best Buy\u2019s business is on the large screen size, and those TVs are sourced out of Mexico. And those products are primarily 55-inch and larger TV sets. And we feel very good about those and where they\u2019re positioned and our inventory levels and the prices and the promotions we build and run on those. And when it comes to the products that are sourced out of China with an advanced lead time, I also feel good about what we have currently in inventory. And we\u2019ll look at our assortment as we move forward, based on where the demand signals are, if there\u2019s any pricing implications to them. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes : I wanted to start with a follow-up on the tightening of the full-year comp guidance and the commentary about the second half uncertainty. So, maybe if you can, just expand on what you\u2019re seeing today, right, as it relates to your consumers\u2019 conversion patterns, both in the store and online, inclusive of trade down or maybe just lower traffic conversion rates. I mean, are you seeing anything that gives you pause today or is it is it more just about conservatism, right, as we head into holiday here? Corie Barry : No. I would definitely not characterize us seeing anything that gives concern today. I mean, I think we\u2019re very pleased with an almost 2 comp domestically here in Q2. We\u2019re seeing good buying behavior and I think we continue to see -- consumer is really interested in the products that we sell. And so, that gives us confidence heading into the back half here. We definitely tightened the range, because A, we\u2019ve just made it through half the year, and the result are there for the first half of the year; and then B, we\u2019re doing our best to look at specific category that we\u2019ve actually mentioned at the beginning of the year, like gaming or like the slowdown in mobile and just making sure that we feel like we take those into account. And then, finally, doing our best in a very fluid and changing environment to think through what we think the implications are in our categories in the back half. Steven Forbes : And so, that\u2019s sort of a perfect segue into my follow-up here. You think about sort of your initial outlook for certain product category growth in 2020, whether it\u2019s an acceleration in certain categories, like gaming and mobile maybe even TVs. I mean, what categories did you -- sort of the greatest amount of pause as you conceptualize the potential demand implications of rising retail prices, given the likelihood that maybe underlying industry growth should be better next year as well? Mike Mohan : Steve, it\u2019s Mike. Peter asked a pretty similar question around what we see for next year. The best way I\u2019d characterize it is, there\u2019s a lot of technology that\u2019s on the forefront of becoming more mainstream for consumers with what we\u2019re seeing this year. 8K TV is a great example of the connectivity solutions with streaming. There is a couple of services that are going to go live later this year that will create excitement in this space. There\u2019s continued demand for people to want to stay connected. And I think this is the way we\u2019re building relationships and memberships around our Total Tech Support offer. But, put those all together, add them into things we\u2019re seeing with good tailwinds, like our appliance business, the places that we\u2019re competing very well. That\u2019s how I\u2019d look at the landscape of categories right now. But again, it\u2019s too soon to give category specifics for our fiscal \u201821 guide. Operator : Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Curtis Nagle : Maybe just a little more specificity, if you could on gaming and why you think, I guess, second half of the year might be a little bit tougher than you initially thought, if I understood your comments correctly. Matt Bilunas : Yes. The gaming cycle is well known, and as the years progressed what we\u2019ve seen is as there is more visibility to a couple of new platforms that have yet to be announced, but are well regarded as they\u2019re coming into play by next holiday season. The demand on the current console business is just off slightly, more than we would have anticipated. And some of the things that are filling in the space that always happens when a gaming cycle happens, are coming in at lower price points. The demand is quite good but is coming in at lower ASP. So, based on those factors and looking at where the category is in this cycle in advance of its next route that would probably indicate why we see some softness more than we expected. Curtis Nagle : And Matt, I think, you alluded to this in some of your commentary in terms of I think that 4Q, but what are you guys expecting in terms of promotional intensity in the quarter? I know things are very fluid. But, any more color on that would be helpful. Corie Barry : Yes. I think Q4 -- I think, it\u2019s always a promotional period. And obviously, we\u2019ve said it before, it is often used as a traffic driver as that eye catching price point. We would continue to expect that to be the case in this Q4. I think, we continue to expect the deals to start earlier and to last longer, I mean all of the things that we\u2019ve pretty consistently been saying. I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s wickedly out of the ordinary or anything in front of us that looks completely different. But, it\u2019s always a promotional period. And I give our teams a ton of credit for their ability to plan for and then really effectively manage through any great Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Just to clarify something on the guidance, and this -- I guess, on cautiousness about or uncertainty consumer spending in the back half. It sounds like that\u2019s entirely pushed into the fourth quarter, right, there you\u2019re not seeing anything that gives you pause around the third quarter. And Corie, I think you mentioned it\u2019s a mix of tariff uncertainty as well as a little bit of category uncertainty. And then, just as part of that and you were asked this earlier, Corie, if you look at like the In-Home Advisor business, not seeing anything where conversion is being affected or you\u2019re seeing lower tickets or just consumers taking a longer time to decide to convert on orders? Corie Barry : I\u2019ll start with the latter from an IHA perspective. We\u2019re not seeing really any changes in behavior as we continue to -- and that\u2019s why we made a point that we continue to ramp our IHAs, and we\u2019re matching that to the demand that we\u2019re seeing. And we continue to really like how that business is performing, so not really seeing anything there. Matt, I don\u2019t know if you have any comments on the overall top-line. Matt Bilunas : No. The overall top-line, I think like we said, we see categories come up and down, like we always do. As we look at this point in the year, gaming is -- like we said is the biggest sequential drag as you look at the back half. I think, the rest of the categories as you look into Q3 are kind of like what we expected them to be, gaming be a little bit of a change. I think, there is also what Corie said earlier, there is always a level of caution as you look at the back half of the year with this type of market. Most of that is probably geared toward Q4, but there is also a little bit over in Q3 as well as we start to see and the tariffs start to come in. Simeon Gutman : My follow-up, just one more on lease-to-own. Can you share with us -- I\u2019m assuming your expectation is that it\u2019s going to bring in -- or you\u2019re going to find new customers into the business. But, can you tell us thus far in the markets that it\u2019s been rolled out. Is it just -- is it an existing customer who is just electing to finance their purchase differently or is it a new customer to Best Buy? Corie Barry : We definitely are seeing some level of new customer. I mean, between the new customers that we\u2019re seeing and what I call reengaged or people we haven\u2019t seen very frequently, that\u2019s actually the majority of who we\u2019re seeing use the program. So, we like the fact that it\u2019s engaging for us a very different customer, maybe one that\u2019s been less frequent with us. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Congrats Corie and Matt. A question I have, you thought -- we spent a lot of time talking here about the uncertainty that tariffs and maybe some product cycles you bring to the second half of the year, you\u2019ve done a great job managing SG&A, even while you are investing, continue to invest in the business. So, the question I have is, to the extent that sales do track a bit choppier or maybe softer over the next few quarters, what leverage do you have on the SG&A side? How would you -- how could you react on the SG&A side to offset that? Corie Barry : Yes. I\u2019m going to answer this in two ways. So, first of all, just to directly talk about SG&A, I mean, I think this quarter was a great example of our teams really being able to continue to find cost efficiencies in the business and to continue to manage the business really tightly. And I think, we have a pretty good track record of being able to flex with the business ebb and flow. And so, I feel really good heading into the back half that our teams are well set up, to be able to manage the SG&A in a way that makes sense. That being said, we\u2019ve been very clear that we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business in ways that are going to bring this strategy to life. And I want to be clear and say, we continue to invest in the business, and we believe strongly in the strategy that we\u2019re bringing. And we\u2019re going to -- we\u2019re going to make those choices as we go through quarter-to-quarter. And so, yes, we definitely can manage what\u2019s manageable behind the scenes, but we\u2019re also very thoughtfully trying to make sure that we invest. And you\u2019ve seen the returns on those investments continue to improve. And so, I think, it feels like we\u2019re doing the right thing. That being said, I mean, I know the start of the question is all about kind of the choppiness of the top-line. Here\u2019s what I\u2019d say and Matt said it too, we continue to be pleased with people and customers\u2019 interest in technology. And while yes, obviously we\u2019re trying to take into account the tariffs, that is genuinely, continuously a very quickly evolving situation. And I just want to reiterate that our teams are doing excellent work with mitigation strategies and at the same time, we\u2019re already seeing a lot of our vendors make some moves and move considerably some of that products. I mean, we talk about our current percent of COGS. We think next year that percent of COGS could be more like 40%. And so, I think it\u2019s really important to note that while we\u2019re talking about a little bit of this choppiness for the back half, the teams and our vendor partners are working together hard to continue to mitigate the impact of those tariffs. And so, yes, we\u2019ll continue to work the SG&A, but I also want to be clear, we like where the strategy is going and we continue to have a really strong point of view that customers are interested in that we were coming to market and the products that we have. Brian Nagel : And then, a follow-up -- and I\u2019m going to apologize, because I think half the questions here, to some extent are better than what you\u2019ve got. So, I\u2019m going to add one more to that. But, if we look at the narrowing of the guidance for the year, and I know to a certain extent we\u2019re splitting hairs because we gave small numbers. But you narrowed more from the top end than you did in the bottom end. If tariffs were not an issue, if the tariffs were not something to consider, how would that guidance -- how could that guidance look or that how could the shift in guidance look? Corie Barry : So, this is the hardest question and almost nearly impossible for me to answer, because the tariffs aren\u2019t just about how they impact the individual SKUs, they\u2019re also about the consumer conditions, the macro conditions. And we\u2019ve seen -- I mean, tariff has been a point of conversation for almost 18 months now. And so, the constant morphing of tariffs and having that as part of the conversation, it\u2019s literally almost impossible for me to strip out and say just List 4 did this. It\u2019s more us trying to take that big step back and say, where do we see the implications, where do we see the consumer and how do we think that\u2019s going to impact the back half. And again, remember, part of the narrowing of the range is also just what we\u2019ve seen already in the first six months of the year. So, it\u2019s impossible to strip that out. Brian Nagel : I appreciate it. Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Before ending, thank you for the questions. I think that was our last. I would like to thank you, Matt, and congratulate you on your first earnings call, and thank you, Mike, for joining us. And I would also like to remind everyone that we will be hosting an Investor Update meeting on September 25th from the New York Stock Exchange, where we will have the pleasure of sharing with you an update on our strategic progress. The event will be webcast live and additional details can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy\u2019s Fiscal Year 2020 Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mollie O\u2019Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company\u2019s current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we have reported $9.76 billion in revenue, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 70 basis points and delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.13, which was up 22% compared to the third quarter of last year. We delivered another strong quarter and are excited about our continued momentum and the opportunities we have ahead of us. Our teams continued to execute well and navigate ever increasing customer expectations, a consistently competitive retail environment, and the uncertain tariff situation. And they are doing all this while making significant progress against our Building the New Blue strategy, which we believe will uniquely position us over the long-term. Specifically, our comparable sales growth of 1.7% was on top of 4.3% last year and above the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Our Domestic segment comparable sales were up 2%, as we continue to focus on the customer experience across online, stores, and at home. From a product category standpoint, the comp growth was driven by strength in appliances, headphones, tablets, and computing, partially offset by declines in gaming and home theater. The Q3 profitability was better-than-expected. This was primarily the result of lower SG&A, due to strong expense management, a reflection of the culture we have built around driving cost reduction and efficiencies to help fund investments and offset pressures. The Q3 gross profit rate was flat on a year-over-year basis. Due to the strong Q3 results, we are updating our annual guidance today. Matt will discuss in more detail later in the call, but at a high level we are maintaining the topline guidance we shared last quarter, while raising the non-GAAP EPS guidance. We are now expecting non-GAAP EPS of $5.81 to $5.91. This compares to the original guidance of $5.45 to $5.65 that we provided last February as we entered the year. As it relates to tariffs, our assumptions of the impact on our business are basically unchanged from our last call. As a reminder, our guidance includes our best estimate of the impact of all tariffs, both implemented and planned, including List 3 at 25%, List 4A at 15%, which was implemented on September 1, and List 4B at 15% which is planned for December 15. As we shared at our Investor Update in September, we are entering the second chapter of Building the New Blue. Our purpose remains the same : to enrich lives through technology. Our strategy is to leverage our unique combination of tech and touch to meet everyday human needs, and build more and deeper relationships with our customers. We introduced three five-year goals at our Investor Update focused on employees, customers, and financials. As a reminder, they are : first, to be one of the best companies to work for in the U.S., exemplified by being named to Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list. Second, to double the number of significant customer relationship events to 50 million. This includes total tech support memberships, homes visited, active digital engagement, financial services, and senior life support. And third, to deliver continued top and bottom line growth over time, specifically to get to $50 billion in revenue and a 5% non-GAAP operating income rate in fiscal 2025. We believe our strategy will translate to an economic model that delivers results by better serving existing customers, capturing new demand, entering new spaces, and building capabilities while maintaining profitability over time. Last quarter, we talked about how our penetration by geographic market varies widely, yet our tools and structure have been one-size-fits-all for our local markets. To better serve existing customers, we made strategic changes to our field operations to accelerate growth and to create a more seamless experience across channels, putting single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain, and home propositions in their market. These leaders are supported by a channel agnostic program centered around insights, data, and analytics, to view market\u2019s largest opportunities and fast-track initiatives that will make a financial impact as well as provide a more seamless customer experience. For example, in the New York area, we are focused on expanding both our fulfillment options and in-home resources. During the quarter, we launched 175 alternate pickup locations for customers in areas where either our store locations are not convenient or the ship-to-home option is not desired. These alternate locations are in UPS stores and CVS stores in the New York market. In New York, as well as Los Angeles and Chicago, online customers can order as late as 8 p.m. and still receive their products the next day for free. Starting in New York, we are also adding the ability for online customers who want their product the same day to select specific three-hour delivery window for that same day delivery. And for those online customers who prefer to pick up the products themselves, we are beginning the process of rolling out curbside pickup at stores in the New York market, where a Best Buy employee will bring the product directly to the customer\u2019s car. To build awareness of these expanded experiences, we have already kicked off a comprehensive local market marketing campaign that includes stores, train stations, billboards, digital, and email. Based on our data, we believe there is much untapped opportunity to serve New York clients in their homes. To capitalize on that opportunity, we are building capacity by adding additional in-home advisors and also increasing the training for existing advisors. We have combined additional resources from both the field and corporate teams to provide these new advisors an accelerated, locally focused training program that we believe will speed up their ramp-up time. This will free up capacity for our existing advisors in the market to receive more training designed to strengthen their clienteling skills, which will lead to deeper customer relationships. Based on local market analysis, we have also added capacity across the country where we continue to see strong customer demand for our in-home consultation program. On a national level during the quarter we added 100 in-home advisors to end the quarter with approximately 720 advisors. As we shared at our Investor Updates, 95% of those polled said they would continue working with their in-home advisor and we continue to see higher spend at a higher gross profit rates from our in-home advisor customers versus other customers. We expect our advisors will become more and more productive as we advance our CRM system and enhance our digital tools. Another important way we are better serving customers and building relationships is through our Total Tech Support program. Total Tech Support provides members unlimited Geek Squad support for all of their technology no matter where or when they bought it, in addition to great discounts and installations, protection and in-home services. We have grown the membership to over 2 million members from about 200,000 when we launched nationally in May of last year. It continues to get strong customer reviews and members spend more and are twice as likely to use other services than non-members. We are building on this early success to continue to deliver more benefits our members are asking for. For example, we are piloting a program, we are calling Total Tech Support with networking that includes routers setup and installation, parental controls to manage every device on the network, a subscription to Microsoft Office 365, and 1 terabyte of cloud storage along with all the standard Total Tech Support benefits. We are also continuing to add new services and capabilities that have the potential to attract new customers. As we shared last quarter, Best Buy is now fully certified chain wide as an Apple authorized service provider, becoming the nation\u2019s largest physical destination in terms of points of presence for Apple authorized repair services including same day iPhone repairs. Almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or haven\u2019t made a purchase in the last year. Our lease to own purchasing option is now fully rolled out in 45 states after we added the last nine states including California and New York just a few weeks ago. This provides another purchasing option in addition to our existing strong credit card offer allowing us to help customers make purchases they might not otherwise be able to. Since we began rolling out the program nationally in March, approximately 65% of lease to own customers are either new to Best Buy or haven\u2019t made a purchase in the last year. We also remain focused on developing digital innovation and marketing strategies to drive engagement with our customers. We continue to enhance our digital shopping platforms both online and on our mobile app, with new functionality and a better customer experience. Our app continues to see strong customer ratings and year-to-date usage of the app is up more than 20%, and usage of our app within our stores is up more than 30%. Our store employees love the app, which has also been improved with their needs in mind. They can now much more quickly see pricing, promotions, inventory and fulfillment times, through features such as Top Deals, which I will discuss in a moment, and expanded availability options. The app also provides employees other recommended products if a certain product is out of stock in their store. During the quarter, we materially changed the way we present product deals to our customers. Several years ago, we created a digital version of our weekly ad as we transitioned away from the paper weekly ad that was distributed every Sunday. We no longer distribute any paper weekly ads, and during Q3, we sun-setted the rigid digital weekly ad technology platform and launched a Top Deals section in our app and on our website. This leverages cost and gives us more flexibility to introduce multiple promotional cycles within the week and ensure we featuring our best offers. Most importantly, Top Deals provides a better user experience and helps customers find products faster with fewer clicks, resulting in higher and more consistent traffic throughout the week and better conversion compared to the old experience. At our Investor Update in September, we also spent time talking about the significant opportunity we see in the health space. Specifically, we have reiterated our focus on helping seniors live longer in their homes through our unique combination of tap and touch, thereby reducing their health care costs and bringing greater peace of mind for them and their families and caregivers. We serve approximately 1 million seniors right now and we shared our goal to serve 5 million seniors in fiscal 2025. Today, most of the seniors we serve are utilizing easy-to-use mobile phone products and connected devices that are tailored for seniors and come with a range of relevant services. With our five star service, customers can talk to U.S. based specially trained agents who can connect them to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel. We expect to continue to scale this business over time in order to reach our five-year target. We also expect to advance our commercial business where the services we provide for seniors are paid for by insurance providers. This includes services such as remote monitoring based solutions that provide meaningful insights to improve timely care and reduce the cost to serve frail seniors. As previously discussed, we have successfully closed and integrated three acquisitions that have given us unique and essential capabilities and infrastructure, talent and a base of customer relationships to build from. We have also hired additional talent to deepen our expertise. That includes Dr. Daniel Grossman, our new Chief Medical Officer for Best Buy Health. He is a practicing emergency medicine physician at a major academic medical center in Rochester, Minnesota, with extensive strategy and business development experiences at leading health tech companies. He has been on all sides of health care, physicians, patients, payer, disrupter and educator. We are excited to have him on our team.  As we have reiterated many times, our continued focus on reducing costs and driving efficiencies in order to fund investments and help offset pressures is a key element of our long-term strategy. In September, we announced a new cost reduction and efficiency target of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2025. We made good progress against this new goal during the third quarter and plan to provide more detailed annual updates on our Q4 call going forward. In addition to our strong business results, we have continued to make strides toward our goal of becoming one of the best companies to work for in the United States. For example, we have recently added a variety of employee benefits, including paid caregiver leave, paid time off for part-time employees, back up childcare, a PTO purchase plan and enhanced mental health resources. We also increased our adoption assistance benefit and introduced a new surrogacy benefit as part of our efforts to support employees who want to grow their families. And finally, last month we announced an updated dress code that allows employees to wear jeans and comfortable shoes. This is something our store employees have been asking for and importantly, saves them money. These changes have all been extremely well received by our store teams across the country. These are just a few examples of the ways we are continuing to invest in our people and underscore our commitment to be a great place to work and these investments have produced some very positive results. Our store turnover remains in the low 30% range, compared to 50% five years ago and our average store general manager has been in his or her role for about six years. In fact, as we enter Q4, more than 92% of our store general managers already have experience leading their stores through a holiday season. Our progress has also been noticed outside the company. We are proud of the breadth of recognition we have received in recent months, including ranking number 66 on Forbes list of the World\u2019s Best Employers and being named the number one Best Company to Work For during the holiday season by Glassdoor. We are also honored to be ranked one of the top employers for students and graduates of historically black colleges and universities. Our culture at Best Buy is incredibly strong. It\u2019s the reason I am here and I firmly believe it is our competitive advantage.  As we look ahead, we are excited about our holiday plans and everything we have to offer our customers this holiday season. Our team has once again put together a best-in-class assortment, prepared an amazing set of deals and ensured we have great inventory availability across all the product categories we carry, and we are supporting that work with a steady drum beat of marketing and promotions that will keep Best Buy top of mind with shoppers throughout the holiday season. Earlier this month, we released our Black Friday ad full of thousands of deals on the hottest tech. Hundreds of those deals were available immediately and we will continue to provide compelling offers throughout the holiday season. On the fulfillment side, we are making it even easier and much faster for customers this year. We are promising free next day delivery on thousands of items all season long with no membership or minimum purchase required. The fact that we are able to make that promise to our customers is a huge testament to all the work our teams have done throughout our supply chain transformation. About 99% of our customers now live in a ZIP code where next day delivery is available, up from 80% last quarter and if a customer lives in an area where free next day delivery isn\u2019t available or they are shopping for an item that isn\u2019t eligible for it, they can still get free standard shipping. As we have shared previously, we also offer same day delivery on thousands of items in 42 markets, and of course, store pick-up remains a fast and convenient option for our customers. More than 70% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Best Buy store and we promise that their items will be ready within one hour of placing an order. And on average 80% of online orders are ready for store pick-up in less than 30 minutes. The NPS store for the experience continues to increase about 40% of our online sales are pick-up in our stores. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we are offering curbside pick-up in a few stores in New York and other select markets across the country allowing customers to pick-up their without even getting out of the car. Our fulfillment options are all focused on providing customers with the choice and convenience they expect and deserve, and with the digital shopping experience on the Best Buy mobile app, it is now easy and intuitive to see your options for when and where you can get your order whether you opt for delivery or store pick-up. I also want to highlight that once again, this year we are supporting the St. Jude Thanksgiving campaign with customer and employee donations in our stores and online. We have been the program\u2019s top fundraising partner for three consecutive years, helping to raise $80 million for St. Jude\u2019s lifesaving work since we first partnered in 2013. We hope to bring that cumulative total to more than $100 million with this holiday season. In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the third quarter and our teams are excited and ready to deliver an outstanding holiday season. I want to take a moment to genuinely thank our amazing Best Buy employees in advance for all their hard work this week and throughout the holidays, whether you work in one of our stores, spend your time making house calls to our customers\u2019 homes or work in a distribution center or the corporate office, please know that you are a critical part of what makes Best Buy so special. The holidays can be a fun and very busy time in retail and I want you to know how much we sincerely appreciate all that you do. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Matt. Matt Bilunas : Good morning, and hello, everyone. Before I talk about our third quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On Enterprise revenue of $9.76 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.13, both of which exceeded our expectations. We saw better than expected top line results in the computing category and a bit softer than planned in the home theater category. Our operating income rate also exceeded the high end of our expectations for the quarter. The higher operating income rate was primarily driven by strong expense management, which was partially offset by a lower gross profit rate than expected. Consistent with our expectations heading into the quarter, recently implemented tariffs on imported goods from China did not have a material impact on our Q3 results. From an international standpoint, we generated slightly higher operating income than we expected despite our top line results being below expectations. Lastly, the favorable earnings per share results versus our guidance also included a $0.03 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate. I will now talk about our third quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 1.8% to $9.76 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 1.7%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.20 or 22% to $1.13. This increase was driven by, one, increased operating income dollars from both a higher operating income rate and higher revenue, and two, a $0.06 per share benefit from the net share count change. These favorable items were partially offset by a negative $0.03 per share impact from a higher effective tax rate. In our Domestic segment, the revenue increased 2.4% to $8.96 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 2% from revenue from GreatCall, which was acquired in October of 2018, partially offset by a loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. GreatCall revenue will be included in our comparable sales calculation the beginning of the start of this year\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were appliances, which includes both major and small appliances, headphones, tablets and computing. These drivers were partially offset by the clients in our gaming and home theater categories. In addition, comparable sales in the services category increased 12.9% versus last year. Similar to the past few quarters, part of the services growth was due to or revenue recognition for our Total Tech Support offer. As a reminder, we will begin to lap this revenue refinement during the years of Q4, so we expect the services year-over-year growth rate to slow materially compared to Q3. Domestic online revenue of $1.4 billion was 15.6% of Domestic revenue, up from 13.8% last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 15% on top of 12.6% growth in the third quarter of last year, which was primarily given by a higher average order values. In our International segment, revenue decreased 4.1% to $800 million. This was primarily driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and approximately 170 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit, the Enterprise growth profit rate was 24.2% was flat to last year. The Domestic gross profit rate of 24.3% versus 24.4% last year. The 10-basis-point decrease was primarily driven by mix into lower margin products, which was partially offset by the impact of GreatCall\u2019s higher gross profit rate. International gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 22.5%, primarily due to higher year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada, which was driven by higher margin in the services category. Now turning to SG&A, domestic non-GAAP SG&A was $1.78 billion or 19.9% of revenue versus 20.6% of revenue last year. SG&A dollars decreased $24 million, primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense and strong expense management. These favorable items were partially offset by GreatCall operating expenses. International SG&A was $173 million or 21.6% of revenue versus $178 million or 21.3% of revenue last year, a $5 million decrease was primarily driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 24.8%, compared to 22.7% last year. The higher rate versus last year was primarily driven by the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in the prior year. We returned a total of $499 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $368 million and dividends of $131 million. With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $700 million we expect to be in the high side of our target of $750 million to $1 billion in share repurchases this year. Our ending inventory addition was down approximately 7% compared to last year. This decrease is primarily due to a timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which occur a week later this year versus last year. Finally, we are still planning capital expenditures for the year to be in the range of $750 million to $800 million. Now, I will discuss our outlook. Let me start with a few comments specific to tariffs. As Corie mentioned earlier, the guidance we are providing today continues to include the estimated impacts of all tariffs net of the mitigating actions we are taking. These include, one, bringing in products ahead of the tariff implementations, two, decisions around vendor and SKU assortment, three, promotional and pricing strategies, four, sourcing changes, and five, other strategies employed in partnership with our vendors. As a quick reminder, the List 4 tariffs are at a 15% level and have two effective dates. The first effective date was September 1st and the most notable affected categories relative to Best Buy are televisions, smartwatches and headphones. The second effective date is December 15th and the most notable categories relative to Best Buy are computing, mobile phones and gaming consoles. Now back to our outlook. Today, we are raising our full year non-GAAP EPS range to reflect the strong Q3 profitability, as well as our improved expectations for Q4. As we shared last quarter, operating income rate expansion in Q3 followed by operating income rate decline in Q4 was assumed in the original guidance we provided at the start of the year. In Q4, we expect a decline in gross profit rate. We expect SG&A rate to be slightly favorable on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense. To provide some color on the expected gross profit rate decline, there are three primary drivers all roughly similarly sized. First, we expect a mix of products to have a negative impact on our product margin rates. As I shared last -- on last quarter\u2019s call, this was due in part to giving our teams a little more flexibility to navigate through the holiday season. Second, we anticipate great pressure in our services category, with the largest driver being higher delivery and installation costs. And three -- and third, our outlook, of course, also includes the estimated impacts of all tariffs. One more note on Q4 expected gross profit rate from a sequential point of view. As I reminded you last quarter, we fully lapped the acquisition of GreatCall and the revenue recognition refinement to our Total Tech Support offer in Q4. So they will no longer be a source of gross profit rate expansion as they have been in the last four quarters. Specifically, our guidance for the fourth quarter is Enterprise revenue in the range of $14.75 billion to $15.15 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of 0.5% to 3%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.65 to $2.75 and non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 261 million shares. On a full year basis we are now expecting Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.2 billion to $43.6 billion and Enterprise comparable sales growth of 1% to 2%. Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate slightly up to fiscal 2019\u2019s rate of 4.6%, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 23.3% and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $5.81 to $5.91, which compares to our previous guidance of $5.60 to $5.75. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question over the phone from Karen Short from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Karen Short : Oh! Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I am wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on the puts and takes on what would get you to the low versus the high end of the comp guidance range for the year \u2013 or for the fourth quarter. And then kind of looking into what that would imply on the operating margin as well, just some little more color on the puts and takes? Matt Bilunas : Sure. This is Matt. I will take that question. First, in terms of the revenue guidance range, I think, obviously, holiday is always a special season for consumer electronics. Price and convenience is very important, and like any holiday, we take a very disciplined approach to setting the range, and so what we have set, we feel it\u2019s very appropriate. I think in terms of what we are excited about that could be a good guide, we have a lot of exciting plans and offers and a lot of those includes very strong fulfillment options for our consumers. We still feel like the consumer is relatively strong and the economic indicators are in a good spot. Although, there\u2019s been some -- a little bit of waning of consumer confidence, we still feel like the consumer\u2019s in a good position, so that\u2019s a good thing for us. Sequentially, mobile phones and computing are expected to improve a little bit in Q4. Home theater is also expected to get a little better than it has been on trend. In terms of what could go the other way, I think, obviously, in the holiday period, a lot of other retailers use our category sometimes to drive traffic, so we are thoughtful about thinking about that in our guidance range. Also -- there\u2019s always a possibility of inventory constraints. We don\u2019t see things at this point, but that\u2019s always a possibility. And in terms of gaming, that\u2019s -- it\u2019s been soft all year and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re thoughtful about the range. On the gross profit side, I think, the puts and takes, I think, we talked about what the pressure was in Q4. I think, obviously, as you go through the holiday, you are never quite sure exactly what all the consumers are going to purchase, and the outlet sales mix can sometimes put a little bit of pressure either to the good or to the bad on your margin. Also, to the extent that our services offerings hold and continue to generate some excitement to the holiday, that could be a good guide as well. Karen Short : Okay. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And just to follow up on the lease to own, you rolled that out to nine new states and any early read on that, maybe percent of customers new versus existing, and then any color on any impact on the comp although I realize it\u2019s still very small? Corie Barry : Yeah. I will tell a little bit about lease to own. First, we were going to start in the same place which is this is an offering we think, it is really good for our customers. At Best Buy, we always start with the branded credit card, but now we have another option for people who may not want to get into a credit card offering or may just have a more challenged credit history. We have talked a little bit about that at Investor Day. It is still a relatively small portion of the comp growth that we are seeing, but it is importantly an incremental -- either new or what had been a lapsed customer for us, and so we really like this opportunity to bring that customer back in. We didn\u2019t launch the next nine states -- the new nine states including New York and California until just a couple of weeks ago, was very late into the third quarter. So, we will see how that plays here over the holiday season and into next year. Next year is really where we feel like we have a chance to continue to accelerate our growth here. This is something you can imagine that takes our associates some time to get comfortable with. It\u2019s a different type of offer, and they need to definitely feel like they have good comfort in offering it. And we also continue to improve our experiences, both in-store, the information we ask for. But importantly next year, we want to be able to also offer it online, which would be a great addition for us. So we like it. It\u2019s a good secondary offer, but still relatively small in terms of the overall comp. Karen Short : Great. Thank you. Corie Barry : You bet. Operator : We will now take our next question over the phone from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. So can you talk about the estimated impact on margins from GreatCall and Total Tech Support? It just seems to me those are higher margin businesses. I guess I would have expected maybe a little better gross margin performance just given the growth of those two segments? Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Yeah. Thank you. I think in our prepared remarks, we talked about how those were both benefits to us for the last four quarters, so they have been helping on the margins. And I think it\u2019s important to remember that from a GreatCall perspective, it increases the margin rate a bit, but it also increases the operating. So from an OI perspective, it\u2019s still relatively neutral. On TTS, what we called out is a specific part to the revenue recognition refinement that we made. Service is a much bigger category. It includes obviously all the other runoff of legacy system, great legacy support offers, as well as installation and delivery and so when you put them together, we try to think of services in totality, and that is not as we talked about, it is a pressure in Q4. So, that\u2019s kind of the way to think about those two. Scot Ciccarelli : I guess I was looking for any kind of quantification, but are you -- but basically the way we should think about it is on an EBIT basis it\u2019s pretty similar to the rest of the corporate run rate? Is that what you are saying, no real contribution to the EBIT line? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. The EBIT line it\u2019s pretty -- it\u2019s relatively neutral for both of those two things as you consider all the factors of services into the TTS as well. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the operating profit in the fourth quarter and then a more strategic question. Operating rate should be down in the fourth quarter, but on SG&A dollars, I missed what do you expect is part of that, if it wasn\u2019t for the cycling the incentive comp a year ago. How much would dollars have been up in the third quarter and what would you expect in the fourth quarter? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. We are not going to get specifics on how much dollars would have been without lower incentive compensation. In Q4, we do expect a carry on some strong SG&A management in Q4. So in Q4 the puts and takes are really lower incentive compensation, but we are also investing a little bit in advertising and labor. So it is going to be -- we do expect it to be favorable comparatively but we are not giving specifics on the lower incentives number. Greg Melich : Got it. And then if we look, overall, I mean, obviously, the comp looks solid. You are driving some categories where maybe we didn\u2019t -- we keep seeing nice growth like appliances. If we were to take the comp in the third quarter and even look into the fourth quarter next year. How much of that comp is driven by average ticket and how much of it is by continued traffic or transaction growth, whether it would be online or in-store? Corie Barry : So the wonderful thing about being more omni-channel now is that tends to be how we look at our organic metric where we are looking at all of our metrics together. And what we saw in Q3 was traffic across all our channels was up at as was our average order value. And so those two were up, we thought and total transactions down just a little bit, but broadly like the health we are seeing in broad traffic up and those order value is up as well. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. And then a last one on just tariffs, I want to make sure I am clear that we are talking -- we talk about List 4. Do you assume that the 15% is going to happen in December or is it just not material because it\u2019s so late in the quarter? Corie Barry : Yeah. It\u2019s a little bit of both. We are assuming\u2026 Greg Melich : Okay. Corie Barry : \u2026that that goes in at the 15th, and at the same time, it\u2019s not very -- that portion, that tranche is not very material on the quarter. That tranche becomes more of a conversation piece for next year. Greg Melich : That\u2019s great. Well, happy holidays, and good luck, guys. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Matt McClintock : Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. Corie, I wanted to dig into IHA a little bit. You talked about hiring an additional 100 IHAs this quarter, but then you also talked about putting in an accelerated training program for IHAs and it seems like you are building out an infrastructure to maybe meaningfully accelerate the number of IHAs that you have. Can you just dig into that a little bit, am I reading that right? Can you talk more to that? Thank you. Corie Barry : Well, I think -- thank you for the question. I think since day one we have said our focus here is on making the very best in-home experience we can seamlessly across all the ways that we interact with people in their homes. And we said repeatedly over the last couple of years, we are going to take our time pacing this, because we definitely want to ensure creating clienteling at scale is not an easy task and we want to do everything we can to make sure we exceed the customer\u2019s expectations if we get a chance to be in their home. I think some of what we have learned around how best to train is now being translated into to your point a bit of a different approach to training. It used to be when we pulled someone on Board we would use other IHAs to a very large extent to really help them understand what was expected of them, how to build a base of business and how to continue to build their clienteling. I think what we have done better now is created a much more standardized training program upfront that we can administer and allows the existing IHAs to continue to build a more robust clienteling capability while we are bringing new IHAs up to speed and getting them ready and working quickly. And so, I think, the team is learning a lot about how best to bring people on, what you train them in first, how to take your more experienced IHAs and put them against some of the more complex jobs. All of those are turning -- helping us continue to refine the IHA model. So to your point, I don\u2019t know if I would say it\u2019s just accelerated as much as us continuing to take the learning and pace where we think is appropriate based on the demand we are seeing. Importantly, I would also underscore the example that we gave in the New York market, which is we also think there are specific markets where this offering could be and should be even more relevant than others. When you look at the data about how people want to interact with us, how they want help in their homes, we think we uniquely have a really interesting opportunity to help people in their homes in these markets, and therefore, our ramping and training a little bit differently for some of these markets. Matt McClintock : Thanks for that color. And then just as a follow-up, you talked a lot about your next day same day fulfillment and how you have improved that year-over-year. How do you look at that strategically for the fourth quarter, specifically this holiday season, given that it\u2019s a shorter holiday season? And how does that compare competitively to other people that sell your products, clearly some of your peers have those options, but for the breadth of product that you sell, it would seem like a lot of your pet competitors just can\u2019t match that? Mike Mohan : Hey, Matt. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. I will start with the last part. We feel really good about how we are positioned competitively. Our teams there just call it two-thirds the way through our supply chain transformation and the progress we have seen to-date and the customer response has been fantastic. And we look at all aspects of what the customers see on our site versus competitors and what we are able to deliver. I think what makes it unique at Best Buy is a combination of automation we put in our large facilities, the metro e-commerce facilities that we added to some of our major markets. And then we have been doing in-store fulfillment both in-store pick-up and ship from store, longer than anybody else. And I think we have found ways to refine that so we can actually deliver on promises on the products that people want the most, so these high value consumer electronic items and depending on where you live in the country, we are just as good as anybody at getting you stuff right away. You can come to our stores or you can get stuff the very next day. And what complements that, I think, that has to be said, as you have got to be in stock on these items too, and I think, that\u2019s something that our teams have proven expertise in. And so you put those all together and that\u2019s what lets us deliver on we think a very compelling fulfillment promise, one that doesn\u2019t cost us a lot of extra money, because of the investments we have made and it\u2019s something that, Matt, talked about in his remarks, we are going to lead into help drive the comp in our fourth quarter. Matt McClintock : Thanks a lot, Mike. Best of luck everyone. Corie Barry : Thank you. Mike Mohan : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe Feldman : Thanks, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to go back to inventory for a moment. You had mentioned you knew it was down timing related to the holiday, but how should we think about it for the fourth quarter, presumably you have brought in a lot more at this point. But just what type of rate of increase should we expect for the fourth quarter if any? Matt Bilunas : Sure. This is Matt. I think we are not going to get the rate of increase at the end of the year at this point, but I think the teams are feeling very well-positioned for the holiday week. Like I said, we had a lower inventory position at the end of Q3 simply because of the holiday shift in timing of being a week a little -- a week later this year. The teams will do what they need to do to be in a good position. I think we are always very thoughtful about bringing in the right amount and how much of that is owned versus not. So I think we are not going to give a specific amount, but I would expect us to continue to match that with the pace of sales that we expect as we head into next year. Joe Feldman : Thanks. And then just to get more specific on appliances, can you talk about what continues to drive the strength there? I mean, are you -- presumably you guys are taking some market share. I am wondering where you think that\u2019s coming from, but also just what is driving such good strength on top of prior strength? Mike Mohan : Joe, it\u2019s Mike. I will amplify a bit of the fulfillment comments to Matt. That\u2019s part of the reason why we have improved our appliance business with the investments we have made in fulfillment. It wasn\u2019t just speed and small parcel, and leveraging our store network. It was our large product delivery and how we built support with our own teams and with partners and we have make sure we improved that. And it\u2019s complemented with the investments we have made in training, marketing, the in-store experience and we thought about this category end-to-end. And as I think most of you know is, a large percentage of appliance purchases happen with something that you don\u2019t expect occurs, an appliance in your house breaks. And frankly a few years ago we just weren\u2019t very good at that and we have made some really big improvements on how we can help customers navigate for items they can get a very next day, for things they can take with them from our stores, and then we continue the reinforcement with our in-home advisors the ability to help sell appliances when we are in your homes and continue to expand our assortment. So it\u2019s a suite of investments across the Board that helped drive this. And as you know, we are now on our eighth year and counting on consecutive comp growth and we have been awarded JD Powers top honors third year in appliances and we like the category a lot and we like the customer response to what we are doing right now. Joe Feldman : Great. Thanks. Good luck with the holiday period. Corie Barry : Thank you. Mike Mohan : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jonathan Matuszewski : Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. So some retailers have called out lengthened purchase decision cycles resulting from tariff-driven price increases. From the strength of your comp, I\u2019d imagine you are not, but maybe just comment on that and speak to how consumers maybe digesting some of the selected price increases you have instituted and whether you are making an expectation for greater elasticity in 4Q? Thanks. Corie Barry : This one is so difficult and we talked about before there just really isn\u2019t a precedent for where we are right now and there are a lot of moving pieces. And as you can imagine, both our teams and our vendors are employing a number of strategies. In the third quarter specifically, we definitely saw a limited number of small price increases. And if you look at the items that were on the list on 4A things like TVs, and especially, some of the smaller screen size. I think in general what\u2019s difficult, though, is that you now have quite a few items that are on any of the less than elasticities for any given individual item are incredibly difficult. And in fact, I think, it\u2019s even more difficult as you head into Q4, which is a highly promotional season and we will be less about whether or not there\u2019s a tariff on any individual item, it will be about promotional positioning throughout the quarter. And so I give our teams a great deal of credit for pretty carefully navigating thus far and to have really good plans into Q4 and we are seeing a variety of mitigation tactics go into place. We talked about this last time we had the call, obviously, we are thinking about where we assort and who we assort, definitely we are seeing promotional decisions being made by every single retailer out there as we head into this period. Obviously some of these are global vendors and they are thinking about how they move their supply chain, what pieces and parts they put into and how they decide to structure any of their different assemblies and we are already seeing some of the manufacturing move. And so, yes, we saw a little bit of impact into Q3, but as Matt said, it wasn\u2019t material enough for us to quantify our call out. Q4 I think is all about price and promotion, and how you are positioning, and we will see how this evolves as we head into next year. Jonathan Matuszewski : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just you mentioned some exciting new kind of fulfillment options in kind of the New York City area. So just help us think about what\u2019s the timeframe as you think about maybe rolling out some of those options elsewhere in the country? Mike Mohan : Yeah. Jonathan, it\u2019s Mike. New York is a great place for us to start primarily because of the density of consumers and our sheer lack of stores in some of the areas we would like to support customers and where we see opportunities from alternative pick-up locations and curbside. Those are primarily the two things we launched in New York first. We see an opportunity to scale those both nationally as we get past this holiday because there clearly things that add value to the shopping experience at Best Buy and that\u2019s something that we think we can do. So it\u2019s a great question. Thank you for asking it. Jonathan Matuszewski : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So one was a thought about, as we think about next year, it looks like you guys are putting up pretty strong comps even though there\u2019s really not a product cycle going on at least that\u2019s my thought. And as we get into next year, it seems like you would have a number of drivers as we get 8K TVs coming down in price, we get a 5G iPhone, and we have two new gaming consoles. So how are you guys thinking about this year versus next year and are my thoughts right? Corie Barry : So, obviously, we are not going to guide for next year yet. But I think what we like about this year is it underscores what has been our strategic point of view and that is people want and need electronics and those are going to continue to evolve over time and we have a very unique offering digitally in our stores and in-home that will help people make the best decisions and keep their products working.  As we head into next year, there\u2019s obviously some things to be excited about. And counter point to that or at least something else to consider is the ongoing impact of tariffs potentially as we head into next year. So what the teams are doing right now as you can imagine is working through all of that, all the mitigation strategies that I just talked about and thinking about how we can put together the right suite of offers and experiences for our customers next year. I think no matter what, we feel like strategically we are positioned in the right way to capitalize on and commercialize new technology, which consistently we are able to do in a way that is very unique in the marketplace. Scott Mushkin : Great. And then my second question actually is, I guess, more strategic, obviously, you guys have been active, somewhat active in M&A with GreatCall and others that you have done. As you look at interconnected home more broadly, Corie, is there more you can do here as we look out rather very pointed at healthcare right now, but it seems like there\u2019s a huge market and huge opportunity especially as you layer in 5G capabilities? Corie Barry : It\u2019s interesting. We don\u2019t talk about it as much or talk about the M&A in it as much, but if you go into our stores, almost every what we would commercially refer to as department is connected to the next one or could be connected to the next one. And our associates are uniquely well-suited to help people navigate through the compatibility or the ability for people to connect broadly in their homes. 5G we have talked about it, it\u2019s going to be a slow roll. It\u2019s going to be market by market. But we have also said, we think there will be some interesting product innovation and that we again uniquely are able to help the consumer through what\u2019s available specifically for them in their market and how could it show up for them in their home in a very seamless and integrated way. And I think, you will see and you have seen the stores continue to evolve in ways that highlight that interconnected capability. And I think, again, our team will, obviously, capitalize on that ability to commercialize any new technology, excuse me, that\u2019s coming down the pipe that will help capitalize on 5G and just processing and information power that will provide. Matt Bilunas : Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Zack Fadem : Hey. Good morning. Can you walk us through your view of the impact of some of the Q4 headwinds around six fewer selling days? And then the Intel supply issues and to what extent you have incorporated these items in your outlook? Corie Barry : So first on the holiday selling season, every bit of consumer data would say consumers are starting earlier in the hopes that they actually can finish earlier. We don\u2019t ever know exactly how that plays out for them, but that is every bit of consumer data that we are seeing. And I think every bit of data that we have seen certainly over the last five years is that the promotional cycle continues to pull earlier and earlier, and that more and more people are launching ads and deals earlier and earlier. Additionally, the fulfillment options that are available to people have completely changed the competitive landscape in terms of how quickly you can get your items with next day, same day, in-store pick-up, all of these being available and we feel particularly strategically relevant for us with our physical locations, our ability to be in your home, our next day available to 99% of the ZIP codes this really suits us well. And so our point of view is that the less days is much less relevant than it used to be historically and that you are going to capture that demand slightly differently, but that demand is coming. We like to joke and say there\u2019s still the same number of days between Halloween and Christmas, and so we feel like shoppers are going to meet their needs the way that they want given all the fulfillment options. In terms of the Intel news, our team would say they feel very well-equipped for holidays and that we have the right products. We have -- Matt talked about inventory, very good inventory levels, lots of availability both in our stores and online. And then we will continue to work on that issue as we head into the next year. And I would argue our merchants are very good at navigating situations like this and are working towards the impacts for next year. Zack Fadem : Got it. Thanks, Corie. And then on the gaming category weakness, curious if you could expand on that in a little more detail whether you think it\u2019s primary -- primarily innovation driven or if there\u2019s something structural there. Just curious on your thoughts on when the category could turn around? Mike Mohan : Yeah. Zack, it\u2019s Mike. I think, the gaming category still is exciting. We think about it broad -- more broadly than just the console category based on what we think and where consumers are looking for experiences to be enhanced. Obviously we are on the year cycle of new devices coming out next holiday. So you have got kind of the best of both worlds for consumers thinking about what they want to do and thinking now -- between now and next holiday what they are feeling. So we have talked about gaming not being a driver for our business and we are seeing that reflect ourselves in the result. But also the category is promotional and drives good footsteps. And clearly this holiday you can see by what we are promoting. There\u2019s some exciting offers and there\u2019s still demand for that. Just at lower price points than they historically have been. I think there\u2019s a sizeable shift and it will be for the foreseeable future how software compliments the experience and we have seen that for some time. So the consumer wants to move into higher power costs of devices more connected as it plays really good to our strengths on getting the right devices and the right accessories to meet the solution. And we think it will still be a great category for us as we move forward. Zack Fadem : Got it. I appreciate that. Thanks so much. Corie Barry : Thank you. Mike Mohan : Thank you. Operator : And our last question will come from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. Can you talk about what drove the improvements in the computing category relative to the prior trend, it seems like that perked up which is great for your business. And then as you look to the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about that category and what drives the expected improvement in home theater? Mike Mohan : Yeah. Chris, it\u2019s Mike. I will start and then, Corie, and Matt, can just chime in. We don\u2019t segment our selling seasons interdependent of our quarters, but we came out of period argues are really strong back-to-school season for Best Buy. Corie talked about in your remarks about the evolution of our weekly ad to Top Deals, which lets us to be more flexible and how we offer deals to everybody that greatly benefited our back-to-school program with our ability to offer students more directly. We focused on a new marketing segment and went for a younger demographic with where we placed our media. And our team is, we already talked about briefly as they do a fantastic job of finding the right value propositions to get things in play and then get a handful of new products shipped during the quarter, which was excellent and we did a superb job on offering pre-orders and an ability to get rid of your old devices. And so when I look at that for Q3 it plays itself going into Q4 quite well and we are seeing great demand on our holiday products right now, we see no reason why it won\u2019t continue, and so we feel good about that experience. We have been investing in for years continues to pay dividends for us. Corie, would you add anything? Corie Barry : No. I would just underscore, I think, this is a place where the team\u2019s done a great job every computer that you could want to look at, feel and touch and get help with is available. And in spaces like now where there\u2019s clearly interest on processing power, interest in high-end tablets, interest in computing, we are just very well-positioned to capitalize on that. So thank you all so much for joining us today. We look forward to updating you in our Q4 call in February, and we all hope -- we hope that you all have a safe and very happy holidays. Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead. Mollie O\u2019Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website investors.bestbuy.com.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we are excited to report strong Q4 results with revenue of $15.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.90. Our enterprise comparable sales growth for the quarter was 3.2% above the high end of our guidance range and on top of 3% last year. We are posting our 12th straight quarter of comparable sales growth and showing our strength as a successful multi-channel retailer who can meet customers when and where they want. We offered compelling holiday deals that resonated with customers and provided a seamless shopping experience, great inventory availability and fast free delivery. Across online home and stores, we are fulfilling our purpose to help enrich people's lives with technology, while also helping technology companies commercialize their products innovation. Our domestic segment comparable sales were up 3.4%. From a product category standpoint, the comp growth was driven by strength in headphones, computing, appliances, mobile phones and tablets, partially offset by gains. We also saw continued growth from our transformative initiatives, like total tech support and in-home consultation. The enterprise Q4 non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.5% was better than we expected due to lower SG&A expense. On the gross profit rate line, the mix of products we sold in the quarter drove a lower rate than we anticipated. For the full year, we grew enterprise comparable sales to 2.1%, expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate 30 basis points and increased our non-GAAP earnings per share of 14% to $6. 07. We also returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In summary, we are proud of these results and I want to thank all of our associates for their hard work, commitment to serving customers, and amazing execution as we navigated ever increasing customer expectations, a consistently competitive retail environment and the challenging tariff situation. Against that backdrop, our associates also continue to drive significant progress against our building the New Blue strategy. We believe our strategy will uniquely position us over the long term by leveraging our combination of tech and touch to meet everyday human needs and build more and deeper relationships with customers. Let me provide some highlights of our progress, starting with how we are better serving our existing customers. We continue to innovate and design digital experiences that solve customer needs across online and physical shopping. This includes enhancing our digital shopping platform with new functionality and evolving our marketing strategy to drive engagement with our customers with a particular focus on our app. Our app continues to see strong customer ratings and usage grew significantly through the year. In fiscal \u201820 customer visits to the app were up 22% overall and usage of our app within our stores was up approximately 17%. Customers on the Best Buy app engage with us eight times more frequently than those who solely use our website or mobile site. At the same time, we continue to transform our supply chain using automation and process improvements to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed and improve the delivery and installation experience. We also continue to improve the buy online, pickup in-store experience for our customers, including the introduction of curbside pickup and alternate pickup locations. As a result of all the work our teams have done throughout our supply chain transformation, in Q4 we promised free next day delivery on thousands of items, all season long to 99% of our customers, with no membership or minimum purchase required. And we also promised online customers who wanted to pick up in store that their items would be ready within one hour of placing an order. As a result store pickup was up over 500 basis points to 42% of online sales in Q4. All of these improvements were made with our customer experiences in mind and they contributed to continued online growth for the year. We saw particularly strong results in the fourth quarter where online sales grew 18.7% and represented 25% of our total domestic revenue. For the year, online sales represented almost 20% of our domestic revenue. We also focused on enhancing the in-home experience for our customers. During fiscal \u201920, we expanded our in-home consultation program from 530 to 725 advisors. This combined with tools to maximize their productivity helped us decrease the amount of time customers were waiting for an advisor appointment. A key driver of NPS and close rates and allowed us to provide more than 250,000 free in-home consultations to customers across the nation. Both employees and customers continued to love it. The Net Promoter Score for purchasers is high at 87 and the advisor employee turnover remains low. Additionally, we are now seeing a growing percentage of repeat purchases, as customers develop and take advantage of their relationship with their advisors. This of course was the intent when we began the program and we're delighted to see these relationships being built as we continue to increase investment in technology that is perfectly suited for this new kind of seamless customer interaction. Providing 24 by 7 support for all their technology needs is another way we build relationships with our customers. Our total Tech Support Program grew steadily during fiscal \u201820 to end the year with almost 2.3 million members. It continues to get strong customer reviews and members spend more and are twice of likely to use other services than non-members. The average member uses the program approximately 2.5 times per year. During the year we also rolled out pilots to test new member requested benefits related to networking, parental controls and data storage. We also made progress on our initiatives to capture new demand and enter new spaces. In fiscal \u201920, we became the nation's largest physical destination in terms of points of presence for Apple authorized repair services, including same day iPhone repaired, almost 40% of these Apple repair customers are either new to Best Buy or haven't made a purchase in the last year. Turning to Best Buy Health, during fiscal \u201920, we continue to advance our initiatives designed to help seniors live longer in their homes with the help of technology. We successfully integrated two additional acquisitions that have given us unique and essential capabilities and infrastructure, talent and a base of customer relationships to build from. We are encouraged by the integration with Best Buy and the conversations we are having with potential partners. Of course, our success with customers and the progress we are making on our building the New Blue strategy is driven by the enthusiasm, talent and purposeful leadership of our employee. During fiscal \u201920, we continue to invest in wages, training and many new employee benefits, including paid time off for part time employees, paid caregiver leaves, expanded mental health benefits, enhanced adoption assistance and a new surrogacy assistance benefit. Our employee engagement is high and our turnover rates in our stores remain in the low 30% range compared to 50% five years ago. Additionally, our average store general manager has been in his or her store for about six years, which is incredibly important from a store leadership and community perspective. In parallel to the customer experience work, during fiscal \u201820 we continue to drive efficiencies and reduce costs in order to fund investments and offset pressure. In the middle of the year, we completed the existing $600 million cost reduction target that we expect in fiscal \u201818. In September we announced our new target of an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiency by the end of fiscal \u201925. We achieved approximately $160 million toward our new goal in the back half of the year. We are also proud of our progress in advancing our corporate social responsibility and sustainability efforts. In fact, we were just named the top five on Barron's Annual 100 most sustainable companies list for the third consecutive year. You can find more information about our efforts in our annual corporate responsibility and sustainability report which can be found at investors.bestbuy.com. Similarly, would like to note our progress related to our teen tech centers, a program we are very proud of and passionate about. These centers are after school learning spaces, equipped with cutting-edge technology where teens learn new tech skills, gain exposure to new career possibilities and benefit from positive adult and peer relationships. We have that at 11 teen centers in the past year for a total of 33 locations across the country. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in this program, with plans to open 11 new centers this year. And we know this work is making a difference, 91% of teens say they are more optimistic about their futures because of their time at the teen tech centers and 73% say they are interested or very interested in studying some aspect of stem in the future. I'm also incredibly proud to report that Best Buy was once again the top partner for the St. Jude. Thanks and Giving campaign, helping raise a record $22 million through customer and employee donations in our stores and online this holiday season. That pushes our cumulative total to more than $100 million raised for the kids of St. Jude since we first partnered in 2013. As we enter fiscal \u201921, we are excited about our opportunities and are encouraged by our momentum. As a reminder, back in September, we set three fiscal 25 targets focused on employees, customers and financial. First to be one of the best companies to work for in the US, exemplified by being named to Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For list. Second, double the number of significant customer relationship events to 50 million. This includes total tech support membership, homes visited, active digital engagement, financial services and senior life supporting. And third, deliver continued top and bottom line growth over time, specifically to get to $50 billion in revenue and a 5% non-GAAP operating income rate in fiscal \u201825. We believe our strategy will translate to an economic model that delivers results by better serving existing customers, capturing new demand, entering new spaces, and building capabilities, while maintaining profitability over time. I would like to highlight some focus areas for this year. First, in service of our existing customer, we will continue to bring our deep CE expertise and unique ability to partner with vendors to commercialize their new technology, offering customers great products and solutions. In this context, we are excited by the opportunities related to technology innovation over the next several years. As we have discussed previously, these are technologies like 8K, OLED, dual screen notebook computers, multiple phones, consumer health products, connected fitness, new gaming consoles, and new products that leveraged 5G capability. We will also launch new categories where we can leverage our digital first mindset, supported by our expertise around curation and supply chain. Some of these will be online only and include areas such as hearing aids, sustainable living products, expanded connected fitness initiative and travel and luggage. These are categories that we believe our customers would expect to find at Best Buy. From a digital standpoint, we will continue to drive engagement with customers during their shopping and ownership journey, while making it a seamless as possible for customers as they interact with us across channels. For example in the app we will make it much easier for customers to discover and benefit from the support services we offer, including scheduling appointments, which is something that currently requires a separate app download. We also plan to utilize location data to make it even easier and more intuitive for customers in the app to see both products availability and the expanding options for fulfillment. From an in-home standpoint, we will continue to enhance the experience for customers, while at the same time testing new opportunities for growth and becoming more efficient in the way we are serving customers in their home. As I mentioned earlier, we now have over 720 in-home advisors and we continue to receive great customer feedback. In fiscal \u201921, we are testing new tiered advisor roles that will match the right employee with the right customer need. We are also continuing to enhance our clienteling technology platform to drive better customer experiences. For example, the platform can increasingly help our advisors use knowledge about their client's current and future need to proactively communicate new promotions and product launches over time that can help meet those customers. In addition to our in-home advisors, we also have approximately 900 Magnolia System Designers, all of whom are supported by nearly 6000 Geek Squad agents, core train and premium home theater and custom installation. Looking forward, we see an opportunity to build upon all of these great resources collectively to enhance the customer experience. Our stores remain incredibly important and must work in tandem with our digital and in-home experiences. In fiscal \u201821, we will continue to enhance both the proficiency of our store associates and optimize the way they work in order to drive stronger customer relationships. We are also investing in technology, including the rollout of electronic shelf labels to all of our stores, to enhance the customer experience and generate cost savings through added efficiency. Additionally, we will test and learn from a small number of new store and remodel pilot with a focus on fulfillment and differentiated shopping experiences for our customers. We will continue to develop and hone our local market focus by leveraging the strategic changes we made last year to our field operation. Designed to create a more seamless experience across channels, these changes put single leaders in a position to be accountable for stores, services, supply chain and home propositions in their markets. These leaders are supported by a channel agnostic program centered around insights data and analytics to view a markets largest opportunity and fast track initiative to accelerate growth. In total tech support, our focus will be on driving new memberships and ensuring our members continue to see the offering and something they can't live without. We know that our members tend to use the offering more in the initial months after becoming a member and our goal is to continue to see the usage increase over time across their membership. As we shared at our Investor update last September, we see an opportunity over time to evolve our many customer memberships, which also includes our millions of My Best Buy customers. We plan to roll out pilots during the year as we work on the best way to simplify offering and move from managing the economics offer by offer which is how we look at it today to a more holistic and streamlined offering that is centered on the customer. Turning to our focus on capturing new demand and entering new spaces, in fiscal \u201821 we plan to expand our lease to own purchase option, by building awareness throughout the year and then adding an option for customers to use lease to own for online transactions in the third quarter. Now I would like to talk about Best Buy Health. As we shared before most of the seniors we currently serve are utilizing easy to use mobile phone products and connected devices that are tailored for seniors and come with a range of relevant services. For example with our health and safety services, customers can talk to US based specially trained agents who can connect them to family caregivers, provide concierge services and dispatch emergency personnel. As we enter fiscal \u201921, there are a number of developments that we believe will accelerate the growth of this direct to consumer business. First, we are launching a number of new products and services, including a new mobile medical alert device, also called PERS, a wearable device, an app designed for both seniors and their caregivers. Second, we are enhancing the customer experience in our Best Buy stores. This includes expanded shelf space and merchandising presentation, as well as the ability for sales associates to help customers activate their devices at the time of purchase, so they can start using the services right away. Third, we have a new distribution agreement with Walgreens to carry our new PERS, device in 6600 Walgreens stores across the country and walgreens.com. Fourth, we signed a new AARP agreement, whereby the organization's 38 million members will get exclusive discounts on our health and safety devices. At the same time we will continue to focus on the commercial health opportunities, where the services we provide for seniors are paid for by health plans, health System and others in the senior care industry. There is a high level of interest in our unique combination of tech and touch and the potential we have to reduce health care costs and bring greater peace of mind for seniors and their families and caregivers. As we expected when we entered the state, the health care industry has long sales cycles and this side of the business will take longer to ramp than the direct to consumer side. Turning to supply chain, we will focus on leveraging automation across the supply chain network and offering customers free next day delivery, which we view as table stakes across the industry. We will also continue to roll out enhancements to buy online, pickup in store to make it even more convenient for our customers to get their products, including alternate pickup locations, as well as curbside pickup at Best Buy store. We have just expanded alternate pickup to approximately 2000 locations across 9 markets and plan to expand to more markets throughout fiscal \u201821. These alternate pickup locations are in areas where either our store locations are not convenient or the ship to home option is not desired. Last quarter we also introduced curbside pickup at approximately 100 stores, which allows customers to pick up their tech without even getting out of their car. Customers are finding value in this option as curbside already accounts for 15% of store pickup units at those locations and we plan to expand this service to the majority of our stores in fiscal \u201921. Of course to bring all of the initiatives we have just discussed to light, we will need to invest in technology. It is imperative to the success of our strategy that we continue to improve our clienteling and CRM program, enhance our data and analytics capabilities and drive artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation. Before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to note that we are closely monitoring the developments related to the coronavirus and our thoughts are with all of those who have been affected. We remain focused on supporting our people and vendor partners during this time. As you all know this is a very fluid situation that is changing daily and that it is very difficult to determine exact financial impact. Our guidance ranges for both Q1 and the full year reflect our best estimate at this time. Based on what we know today, we have assumed the majority of the impacts occur in the first half of the year. Therefore we view this as a relatively short term disruption that does not impact our long term strategy and initiative. For the year, we expect comp growth of flat to up 2% and a non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.8%. This guide reflects our continued investment in those areas necessary to make strategic progress and deliver enhanced employee and customer experiences, as well as our continued focus on driving cost savings and efficiency. We remain confident that our fiscal \u201821 plan moves us along the path to achieve our fiscal \u201825 targets, specifically the financial targets of $50 billion in revenue at a 5% operating income rate. In summary, we are pleased to report strong results for the fourth quarter and full year and our amazing team are motivated and ready to deliver on our fiscal \u201821 initiatives. As you can see, we have a lot of exciting work underway and ahead of us. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our fourth quarter results and our guidance. Matt Bilunas : Good morning. Before I talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year, I would like to talk about them versus the expectations we shared with you last quarter. On enterprise revenue of $15.2 we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $2.90 both of which exceeded our expectations. We had better than expected revenue results both online and within our International business. From a category perspective, we saw stronger than expected performance from computing and headphones, whereas gaming and smart home were a bit softer compared to our previous estimates. As Corie mentioned, our non-GAAP operating income rate also exceeded the high end of our expectations for the quarter. The higher operating income rate was driven by lower SG&A, which was primarily the result of lower than expected incentive compensation expense and strong expense management. This was partially offset by a lower than expected gross profit rate. I will share additional details on the gross profit rate drivers later in my prepared remarks. The favourability - the favorable earnings per share results versus our guidance also included a net $0.03 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate that was partially offset by a higher share count. I will now talk about our fourth quarter results versus last year. Enterprise revenue increased 2.7% to $15.2 billion, primarily due to the comparable sales increase of 3.2%. Enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS increased $0.18 or 7% to $2.90. This increase was driven by a $0.12 per share benefit from the net share count change and a $0.06 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 2.6% to $13.85 billion. The comparable sales increase of 3.4% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, the largest comparable sales growth drivers were headphones, computing, appliances, mobile phones and tablets.  These drivers were partially offset by declines in our gaming category. In addition, comparable sales in the services category were essentially flat to last year. As we shared previously, the slower growth, as compared to previous quarters is primarily due to lapping the refinement of revenue recognition for our total tech support offer we made in Q4 of last year. Within the quarter, growth from total tech support revenue was largely offset by a decline in warranty revenue. Looking forward, we expect comparable sales growth in the services category to be in the mid single digit range next quarter. Domestic online revenue of $3.5 million was 25.4% of domestic revenue, up from 21.9% percent last year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 18.7% over the fourth quarter of last year. The growth was primarily driven by higher average order values, but also benefited from increased traffic and improved conversion rates. In our International segment, revenue increased 3.4% to $1.35 billion, primarily driven by comparable sales growth of 1.6% and approximately 150 [ph] basis points of positive foreign currency impact. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate was 21.2% versus 22.1% last year. The 90 basis point decrease was primarily driven by items we shared on last quarter's call, these included one, an unfavorable sales mix of products, two, rate pressure in our services category and three, impacts associated with tariffs on goods imported from China, which was largely aligned with our expectations heading into the quarter. During the quarter, we experienced more pressure from product mix than we previously expected due to heavier mix in certain vendor products. International gross profit rate decreased 30 basis points to 22.6%, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gross profit rate in Canada. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A decreased $48 million compared to last year. The decrease was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense, which was partially offset by a number of items, including variable expenses associated with higher revenue and higher advertising. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A decreased approximately 70 basis points to 14.7%. I would like to say a few words on incentive compensation expense, which has been a driver of lowest SG&A expense compared to last year throughout fiscal \u201920. Most of the variability over the course of the year has been due to last year's results, significantly exceeding our incentive performance targets. Compared to our original expectations at the start of the year, lower than planned incentive compensation had an approximately 10 basis point favorable impact to our full year fiscal \u201820 operating income rate, but nearly all of the impact occurring in fourth quarter. International SG&A of $215 billion increased $8 million and was flat to last year as a percentage of revenue. The $8 million increase was primarily driven by expense associated with new store locations in Mexico and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. As Corie said, during fiscal \u201820 we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders though $1 billion in share repurchases, $527 million in dividends. This morning we announced that we increased our quarterly dividend 10% to $0.55 per share and provided an outlook for share repurchases of $750 million to $1 billion in fiscal \u201821 I would now like to talk about our outlook. Our full year fiscal \u201821 financial guidance is the following, enterprise revenue in the range of $43.3 billion to $44.3 billion. Enterprise comparable sales of flat to 2%, enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4.8%, enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $6.10 to $6.30 and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 23%. I would like to call it a number of assumptions. We expect to continue to operate in a positive consumer environment in 2020. As Corie mentioned earlier, our revenue guidance also includes our best estimate of the impacts from supply chain disruptions caused by the coronavirus outbreak. We expect our gross profit rate to be approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. SG&A as a percentage of revenue is expected to be slightly up to fiscal \u201920. As it relates to capital expenditures, we plan to spend in the range of $800 million to $900 million, as we continue to build the capabilities needed to execute our strategy. The increase in capital expenditures will include some of the areas Corie noted previously, such as deploying electronic sign labels and continued investments in technology, health and supply chain. As it relates to the first quarter, we are expecting the following, enterprise revenue in the range of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion, enterprise comparable sales growth of flat to 1%, non-GAAP diluted EPS in the range of $1 to $1.05 and non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 22.5% and a diluted weighted average share count of approximately 260 million shares. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Peter Keith : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask on the full year guidance, so it looks like at the midpoint you're guiding to about 2% earnings growth which is a little bit below last year's initial range and also below kind of the long term CAGR to 2025 of about 4% percent before buyback. So I would assume there's some coronavirus impact to the numbers, but could you just kind of frame up why the overall earnings growth is a little bit below maybe normalized run rate? Matt Bilunas : Sure. This is Matt. I'll start with that. First, as [Technical Difficulty] remarks, believe we're operating in a very positive consumer environment similar to last year, all the data points indicate a good consumer unemployment is good, wage growth is good, consumer spending is good and wage forecast. That being said, separately there is some supply chain related issues as a result of the coronavirus. So on the low end of our guide we would assume that there is a material disruption - supply chain disruption from that, and we \u2013 and that we can't make it all up in the year. So that's one reason, as we said we did factor in the coronavirus outbreak into the overall guidance and the range. We're still very positive about of number of initiatives that we have, such as IHA and TTS growth. There are certain categories that we still expect to perform strongly next year, such as appliances and headphones. Like I said total tech support is still an area of growth for us next year. Gaming would be an area where we are expecting it to be down on a year-over-year basis as well. We do expect to see new console launches in holiday period next year, but the first three quarters will be down or we expect to be down. And then we still have moderate assumptions for TV and mobile phones to the extent that there is better adoption, some of those new technologies like 5G and 8K then that could help move us up towards that range. So to your earlier point, yes we did try to factor in the coronavirus outbreak into the overall year end and that did have some impact to the overall guidance. Peter Keith : Okay. Thanks. And maybe quick follow on, is there way to think about the impact of coronavirus on first half of the year, maybe from a comp sales perspective, understanding that and it might be wrong, but would be helpful and how much is factored in at this point? Corie Barry : So - Peter this is Corie. I think trying to size perfectly the coronavirus impact at this point is incredibly difficult. I think you as much as anyone would respect it, it's incredibly fluid situation. We are trying to for Q1 and the full year estimate as best we can the impact, mainly in the form of lower sales volume, as you could imagine and we literally so far have gone vendor-by-vendor to analyze the size of the impact. But it is complicated and very difficult to size. And we're trying to weigh things like which factories are back up and running and they're all at varying capacities across Asia. Even if the product isn't final produced in Asia, some people are waiting for components that may flow from there. There are varying levels of safety stock across the industry and global vendors have varying levels of global inventory and then obviously estimating the transportation situation once the production comes back it is also difficult. And so based on what we know today, we're assuming the majority of the impact is in the first half and we do view it as a relatively short term disruption that doesn't impact our longer term strategy. But obviously right now we are isolating our approach to the supply chain impacts. And as Matt said, we're assuming the consumer continues on a relatively good pace. So there's still a lot for us to learn there, which means sizing it perfectly just doesn't seem appropriate at this point. Peter Keith : Okay, fair enough. That's helpful. And thank you very much. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Josh on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our questions. The complexion of your margin guidance is a little bit different from the recent past. What are you doing to stabilize gross margins when some of the headwinds like tariffs appear to be rising and their internal or external factors responsible for the reversal on SG&A leverage that you've seen over the past few years? Matt Bilunas : Sure, as it relates to gross profit in Q4 I think the implied guidance going into the quarter - excuse me, assumed about 60 to 70 basis points of pressure. What we saw in the quarter largely played out with what we expected in the same areas. As a reminder what we said was one of the buckets was unfavorable sales mix of products and vendor mix was part of that. Services pressure was another aspect to the pressure we saw going into the quarter. And then as well we factored in tariffs on imported goods from China, largely those all still played out. What we did see was a little bit more pressure on the sales and vendor mix than we expected. During the quarter, we made a point to meet the market in a few key categories, we weren't leading the market from a promotional perspective. In those categories, the customer demand was very high, even higher than we probably even expected going into it and the mix so that had a negative impact on margins. So we don't believe that we wouldn't characterize it as irrational or overly promotional, more or more or less just meeting the customer demand in a very thoughtful way. And if you step back and look at the entire year, the full year gross profit was down 20 basis points. Q4 was of - most of that decreased. And as we said next year we're expecting gross margin rates to be flat. So we do believe that pressure will start to stabilize next year. Now we're not going to guide every quarter and we don't expect it all be the same. But from a full year perspective we do expect some of that to stabilize through the next year. Unidentified Analyst : And, sorry\u2026 Corie Barry : I think some of our - I'm sorry, go forward in nature for next year and the reason we think they stabilized a bit more, there's a couple of things. One, while tariffs had some impact on Q4 for the next year we would expect there to be very minimal impact over the years. The teams work through their own efforts to mitigate. And obviously that gets a little hard to measure along with the coronavirus impact. But we feel like the teams are very well positioned to mitigate the vast majority of the tariff impact for the next two year. So that's part of what changes the trajectory of that margin pressure as we head into next year, as well more of a stabilization of the services business as Matt talked about, as we lap all of the changes to the total tech support curve and all those things, next year, you have a bit of a stabilization there as well. In terms of your SGA leverage question, I think we would characterize that as two things, one, Matt mentioned the incentive comp implications over the last year and we are pretty specific about that. And then two, the cost reduction and efficiencies work that the team has done, at least the portions of that also flows through SG&A and that's a bit of where we're also picking up some of that leverage. Unidentified Analyst : Right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I apologize just for each one hitting on the coronavirus issue, its obviously topical. I mean, clearly as you've mentioned it's fluid. But I guess the question I have is, as you start to try to contemplate what impacts this could have on 2020 trends, could you help us understand what you're seeing if anything right now or are you seeing indications of supply chain disruptions at the moment or are they coming in the very near future? Thank you. Mike Mohan : Hey, Brian. This is Mike. Thanks for the question. When we do all of our product forecasts on department [ph] selection process, as we have full visibility to what's coming into the country through a variety of sources from our top vendors, including the things we source directly. So what we're trying to infer in our guidance, I think, you see is there is a handful of issues around some items that are going to either be delayed or we have some constraints that add full transparency at [Technical Difficulty] we\u2019re not also speculating is any delayed launches of technology. And so I think about this a little bit how we thought about tariffs last year. You know, the U.S. market is the most important consumer electronics market in the world and we're a very significant part of that. And so when we think about high value goods and new technology and where consumer demand is everything gets prioritized for this part of the world. And I don't think that's going to change when things are back running at full speed and our partners want to work with Best Buy just like we're making sure everything we can do to help them during this trying time is in play. That's part of the best visibility I can give you right now. Brian Nagel : That's really helpful. Thank you. And then if I could just slip one quick follow up then. As we look at the fourth quarter gross margin and you called out a number of kind of transitory or unique factors that contributed to that decline. But is there a way you could parse it out more, just so we can understand the true margin performance of the business as we take into consideration guidance for flat margins here in the next year? Matt Bilunas : Sure. I think as we went into the quarter, we gave - I gave you the big buckets of where the pressure was. It was the product mix sales and vendor mix and then services category, as well as tariffs. Last time we spoke, we did go to indicate that most of those buckets kind of equally weighted. And again we implied this guidance to be down about 60 to 70 basis points. So you know, you can do the math there. As we went through the quarter, we also - as we just said a second ago, we did see a little bit more pressure on the mix for products and vendor mix, so that would make that a little bit more of the increase from where we expected it to be. If that helps? Brian Nagel : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : Good morning. I actually will not be asking a coronavirus related question. I actually wanted to talk a little about rent-to-own. I guess, I have two questions. First off is, you know, was offering rent-to-own financing a significant contributor to the domestic comp performance? And then the second question, you know, you mentioned, it sounds like you're going to be maybe advertising a bit more aggressively. You also mentioned having it online in the third quarter. I just wondered if you can just give us a little more color in terms of on the advertising piece in terms of what your plans are there for rent-to-own. Thank you. Corie Barry : So, good morning, Anthony. I'll start with the significant question. [Technical Difficulty] is definitely having a bit of a positive impact, but it is still relatively small in the scheme of things. And so it's not - I would not characterize it as significant to the nature of your question. Second in terms of advertising more or going online, we definitely think that having this as a digital offering is important, just giving the way we're seeing our customers shop, we want to be able to have this as an option online. So yes, you'll see that in Q3. From an advertising and marketing perspective, we've been doing some regional testing on that. I wouldn't expect to see it go full scale, put a ton of muscle behind a big marketing or advertising campaign. I think we feel right now this is mainly a referral process. As we've talked about before, we tend to start customers with our own branded private label card. And if for any reason they are aren\u2019t unable to qualify for that then we move on to the lease to own option. And so I think it's a little bit less about a large scale advertising effort. And we continue to see it as a nice secondary option. And look financing and purchasing is all about different purchase options and that's what we feel like we can provide you. Anthony Chukumba : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. We want to focus on either the aggressiveness or the conservative nature of the gross margin expectation for \u201820 - fiscal 2021. So can you give us a sense for the cadence of gross margin over the course of the year, do you expect to be down in the front half and up in the back half? And what would have to go right for it to be better than that and what would have to be go wrong for it to be worse than that. And the question comes just on the heels of you missing your gross margin expectation in the fourth quarter because of mix. Matt Bilunas : Yeah. Thank you. In terms of next year's gross profit rate, I would characterize, again the year we're expecting it to be flat and we outlined a little bit of the puts and takes there, I think from a benefit perspective we expect to see continued growth in our health business. And as Corie mentioned, continued cost reduction efficiencies helping us on the margin rate. On the under pressure side, what we will see a little bit pressure on the supply chain as we move bigger products through our supply chain system and we'll see a little bit of pressure there too. Tariffs will be a little of an impact, but again not a material impact next year. And services when you take out health, will be a little bit of a pressure next year, again as we're moving more light products. So those are kind of the major things that are benefiting and putting a little pressure on it. We're not going to get exact quarter guidance, things aren't always going to be the same in every quarter. But I wouldn't expect that any quarter to be much different than that - that basic makeup, meaning one materially down versus the other, at least as far as we can see right now, we do expect it to stabilize for most of the year and we will - some of that pressure we saw this Q4 we would expect to lap as we look into next year. Michael Lasser : If I can also add one clarifying question. Have you only assumed supply chain disruptions in your guidance. How long do you assume those will persist? And have you assumed anything about changes in behavior - consumer behavior because of all the headlines we're seeing? Corie Barry : Right now we have isolated it to supply chain disruption, because literally every consumer indicator and every more macro forecast that we can get our hands on right now would say you continue to see growth in the consumer and for us to predict exactly how the consumer is going to react, given how quickly this is evolving and changing every day, didn't seem prudent. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steve Forbes : Good morning. Maybe you've just given all the near-term noise here with the virus. I kind of want to step back and revisit the 5% long term EBIT margin target, right, given the achievement of that level in the U.S. segment this year. So if you can maybe just discuss how the expectation breaks down on a segment basis, right, as we look out and if possible provide some directional color around the EBIT margin structure for 2020, 2021 on a segment basis? Matt Bilunas : Sure. So overall I think as we tried to achieve or as we look achieve the 5% goal in FY \u20192025, I think we've always talked about the path that, that wasn't going to exactly be linear. We did achieve a pretty high operating income rate end of the year. A chunk of that was actually due to the short term incentive favourability that we had. So as we look at next year and the years out, we still expect health to be a good contributor to that expansion of OI rate. Internationally, I would say more of the same, probably operating income rate more stabilized over that period of time. Domestic is where we'll probably see more of the expansion, as we look into FY \u201925 from a segment perspective. Steve Forbes : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wondered if I could talk about the holiday season, just how did you manage the 6 fewer days. And did you see any change in pattern or demand as a result? And just from a promotional standpoint with promotions coming earlier is that something that impacted gross margins during the quarter? Corie Barry : So I'll start and Mike can add anything he would like to. I think one of the things we're most proud of in terms of Q4 is that it really felt like our investments and our digital experiences and our supply chain were really paying off. And I would definitely extend kudos to our merchandising and marketing team who just did a great job, hitting promotions early in the holidays and ensuring that we had a really consistent plan throughout the holiday season. We said in our last call when we guided, we felt like the number of days was not nearly as large an impact as this year as it had been in the past. Meaning, because there are so many ways in which you can get product fulfilled and how we felt about our strength with next day, same day and particularly in-store pickup, which we said was 42% of what we sold online. We had a really unique ability to offer customers what they wanted on the terms that they wanted it. And so I think this was a period where we really felt like we could see the investments that we had chosen to make up to this point shine. Mike, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add. Mike Mohan : I would just thanks Corie. Kate, I would just reinforce the efforts that we talked about at the investor event in September, really thinking about customer experience around fulfillment and what the role Best Buy could play you know, more on a long term basis. We knew the environment would be different than we've historically thought about the timeframe broader than just the days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and being able to deliver things that consumers wanted, when they want it and where did it played out well for us. And I think that's a big part of our strategy going forward. Kate McShane : Okay. Thank you. And just one follow up, an unrelated question. I think you talked about the decline in warranty growth during the quarter. But within the guidance for services for 2020, it sounds like you said it would be up mid single digits. So I just wanted to know what the view is on warranties within that guidance or will the majority of growth be from the total tech support? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. Thank you for the question. Next year total tech support will drive most of our service growth next year. I think in Q4 we did see a bit of a lower warranty revenue. Maybe if you think about the mix of products we sold and heavier online mix as well those tend to put a little bit pressure on the warranty revenue which we saw in Q4. Next year we believe that stabilizes a bit and \u2013 but most of that growth we're going to see next year is on the total tech support side. Kate McShane : Thank you. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Baker with Nomura. Mike Baker : Great, thanks. A couple of follow ups. In fact, I'll follow up right on the services question. So mid single digit from total tech support yet you have 2.3 million people signed up now and I think a year ago it was like a million. So that\u2019s like a double. So I guess why wouldn't that be growing more than mid single digit? That's one question. The second follow up is on incentive comp, you said 10 basis points it helped relative to your plan for the year and you'd already been planning it down in that 10 basis points if it was mostly in the fourth quarter, is like 30 basis points for the quarter. I guess, the two questions there is, one, in such a short amount time, how could have been so much better than plan, especially with the fourth quarter being a pretty strong quarter. Why would it have come in so much lower than planned? And in total how much did it help year-over-year, not just relative to plan? Thank you. Corie Barry : So the TTS, the total tech support side and the growth that we're driving there, we're actually seeing that grow and I think what you have to remember is this is one of those recurring revenue businesses that's going to pay back over time. There is growth there. On the flip side, we also plan to invest more in free installation and delivery, which eats away at some of that growth and also shows up in the services line. I think broadly, I would go back to, though, what\u2019s important to us is what we talked about at Investor Day, which is services as is defined in that line on our 10-Q, and then there are services as we think about it, which is a much broader definition and includes things like the membership that we talked about, in-home consultations, like the broad range of things we offer for customers. And so I would absolutely ask you not to just think about services as the revenue that you see there, but as a broader suite of things that we provide for our customers. Mike Baker : Okay. Can I follow up on that? So when I pay the total tech support, which I am a member by the way, it was 199 spread out over a year. Does that does that fall into that services line item? Corie Barry : Yes. Mike Baker : Okay. Thanks. Then on the incentive comp, again how could it have been so much better than plan if the fourth quarter is pretty good. And then what was the plan I guess? Matt Bilunas : Yeah, as you can imagine every year we set the FDI Based on this year's budget and going into the quarter we had fourth - and then we changed the guidance forecast every quarter during the year. Going into Q4, we simply had a forecast that had us achieving some of those budgeted expectations that are the basis for both our store plans and our corporate plans and by the end of the quarter we said we just didn't get to those budget expectations and hence the better than expected incentive compensation for the quarter. Mike Baker : So presumably they were gross margin plans, rather than sales plan? Matt Bilunas : We have - the predominance of our plans are both revenue and operating income. Mike Baker : Okay. Thank you. Understood. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Ray Stochel : Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit more about the electronic sign label investment? I think we've seen that in stores. What exactly are you referring to there? How significant is it and how are you thinking about ROI and strategy there? Mike Mohan : Hey, Ray. Its Mike. Thanks for the question. Yeah, you're correct. We have rolled out approximate 200 stores in our chain with electronic signs and we've been testing a variety of different ways of doing two things to truly see how to improve the customer experience with more accurate information on the tags, more flexibility on our pricing, which has a significant corollary [ph] benefit of having less people needed to physically change price tags. And as you could imagine in this omni channel world highly promotional timeframes like the end of November to the Christmas selling season we still have a lot of our employee labor dedicated to resetting the store, reprinting tags, heading up bundle promotions. We do a lot of unique things. We needed to really pilot this to understand it couldn't handle all the aspects of pricing for Best Buy because we're far different than a mass retailer or a grocery store. We're very happy with the outcomes that we're seeing and we finalize a program to scale this to the balance of chains. So we see that as a net benefit for us long term both on cost standpoint and employee engagement standpoint and most importantly our customer experience standpoint. Ray Stochel : Great, thanks. And then could you give us a sense about - around how toys performed for you all this holiday. It looks like you've grown assortment over the last few years without Toys\"R\"Us in the market, is this a meaningful business for you all now. And are you seeing any of the overhangs that other retailers discussed? Thanks. Mike Mohan : We are growing the toy assortment right, but it is not a meaningful business for us. And I don't think it will be. We look at toys as nice color to our gaming business and traditional gaming has been down, computing gaming is up significantly and we're always trying to find ways to meet our customers where they are from our shopping experience and we'll continue to do that. But it's not a very large part of our business today. I don't see it being that in the future. Corie Barry : I think the wonderful thing is the vast majority of our assortment is now been in toys by kids. When you think about iPad, when you think about computing gaming, I mean, toys for us such a bigger answer because of the way kids are growing up today what they value in life. So it's not just about the toys open for us, it's about being positioned right at holiday to finish the list, like Mike said. Ray Stochel : Great. Thanks, again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : Thanks, guys. I think I wanted to touch on just the kind of the cadence of new technology coming to market. I know Corie you kind of outlined some of the things in the next couple of years. But I know there's been some thoughts with 5G will really be a 2021 event and that the 8K TV cycle might disappoint a little bit. So I was just trying to get your view on kind of the cadence of new technology coming to market? Mike Mohan : Scott, I'll start and Corie could definitely chime in. I mean, we're always excited about what technology has given, the role we play. I think it's both, it's a short term and a long term game. What I mean by that is short term there's a lot of noise out there around what 5G is or isn't from the mobile networks or consolidation that likely is going to occur and that's just going to create confusion for consumers, when that happens, I think Best Buy plays a significant role. There's an advantage with a 5G network will do today, but we're just starting to scratch the surface on what it will do longer term when I think about it from an overall standpoint of being connected both mobile and in your home. I think Best Buy's position is \u2013 we\u2019re excited about it. We're going to continue to lead it innovation that\u2019s currently helping consumers to understand what it can do. And it will drive some demand on the mobile sector regardless because of the new devices that come out that people want to understand. The second question on 8K TV, I think the technology well - it's interesting what it does, what it really does it enables customers to get a better quality, larger television set and that is one of the key driving things that we see. When consumers bring something on one of the reasons we actually get TVs returned today, one of the top reasons that they didn't buy it, as big of a TV as they thought they should have, even though they had the space and the better the TV can look with 8K resolution, it helps easier to have that conversation with the consumer and get them what they really  So we see as a driver for large screen TV and that's been a significant part of the business segment to date and I think it will continue to drive going forward. Corie Barry : And the only thing I would add to what Mike said is that, when it relates to 5G I think we have a really unique advantage here. When we think about our very localized market based strategy and combined with our ability to commercialize new products which will be coming over the next, to your point, multitude of years, we can help customers because it's going to be market by market and it's going to be confusing for customers because at some point we'll be available some it won\u2019t. And this is where I think our market strategy and our ability to commercialize technology really will show up over a multitude of years here. And with that, go ahead\u2026 Scott Mushkin : No I was just going to because no one touched on it yet, I just wanted a quick thought on the health care initiatives and what kind of pushback you get from healthcare providers. I know it's right at the end, but I was just wondering if you can give us color there? Thanks. Corie Barry : Yeah, I think \u2013 and you're probably mainly referring to the commercial side of the business which is where we're working on some partner - with providers. I think it's less about pushback and it's more about how do we collectively move it. It's very new, it's very different, actually everyone is very interested in health care in the home. There isn't a partner we talk to is not interested. It's a question of how do you fit it into the existing reimbursement methodologies, existing system, existing way we think about care and how do you provide enough room for test and pilot at a small level, so we can learn enough that it makes it worthwhile to roll out on a larger scale. So it's not - it's not actually pushback. There's a lot of interest. It's a question of how best do you start a pilot and then scale. Corie Barry : And with that, I think that's the last question. I want to thank you all for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our next call in May regarding our Q1 results. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 am Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O\u2019Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial conditions, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the Company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company\u2019s current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get into the details of our results, on behalf of all of us at Best Buy, I want to extend our sincere appreciation and gratitude to all those who are on the frontlines working to keep us safe or maintain essential services. And we offer our heartfelt sympathy to all those who have lost someone to this virus or who are sick with COVID-19. Today, we are reporting Q1 revenue of $8.56 billion, which is a decline of 6.3% from the first quarter of last year. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.67 compared to $1.02 last year. The Q1 non-GAAP operating income rate of 2.9% was down 90 basis points from last year, primarily due to the operational disruptions caused by the pandemic, which Matt will provide more details on later. This pandemic has changed the way we work, learn, care for ourselves, and importantly connect with each other. Against that backdrop, our purpose has never been more relevant to enrich lives through technology. It is because of that purpose that we were in virtually every jurisdiction with the stay-at-home order in place, designated an essential retailer because of the products and services we offer. I wanted to take a moment to share how Best Buy has been responding and will continue to respond to the crisis we all face. There are scenarios we plan for as business leaders, and then there are events that simply do not have a playbook. This is one of those times, and our leadership team has been responding to events with a focus on keeping our customers and our employees safe, while we meet our customers\u2019 essential needs. At the same time, we are committed to ensuring that as this evolves, Best Buy is well-positioned to thrive in what will almost certainly be a new and very different environment. On March 22, we proactively moved all our stores to a contactless curbside-only model, allowing us to safely serve customers and comply with government orders and recommendations. We also halted all in-home installations, repair, and consultation services choosing to leave the product at or near the doorstep. We did this even in jurisdictions where we were not required to because we believed it was the best way at the time to keep our customers and employees as safe as possible. I am so incredibly proud of our team's ingenuity and execution. They seamlessly implemented a new and highly effective operating model in a matter of 48 hours across our entire store base. As a result, we retained 81% of last year\u2019s sales during the last six weeks of the quarter as we operated in the new model. That's 81% sales retention even though not a single customer set foot in our stores. The strong sales retention is a testament to the strength of our multi-channel capabilities and the strategic investments we have been making over the past several years. It is also a testament to the Best Buy culture and our focus on the customer experience as the entire organization pivoted to execute and support this new model. More than ever, we are fulfilling essential technology needs for customers. In mid-March, we began to see a surge in demand for products that people needed as they complied with stay-at-home orders. That demand continued even after we closed our stores to customer traffic. For the quarter, we saw strong sales growth in computing, gaming, and small appliances. Like many other retailers, we saw sales benefit during the last three weeks of the quarter as customers undoubtedly chose to spend some of their government stimulus money on the products and services we provide. As we entered the second quarter, we continued to shift our operating model as we responded to the evolving environment. On May 4, we began welcoming customers back into our stores to shop Best Buy in innovative ways that follow strict social distancing practices and use proper protective equipment. Specifically, we are offering a new consultation service to our customers in our stores by appointment only. This service allows customers who need to purchase more complex items to schedule an appointment with one of our sales associates at their local Best Buy store where they can get advice tailored to their specific tech needs. Customers can schedule appointments by phone, online, or by simply driving or walking up to a store. We started with approximately 200 stores, and now have almost 700 or about 70% of our domestic stores operating this way. Most of the remaining stores are still operating in the curbside-only model, and approximately 40 stores remain completely closed mainly due to our own decision-making criteria regarding employee and customer safety. Customers have responded very positively to this new way of interacting with us in our stores with 98% of customers surveyed indicating we made them feel safe during the experience. It is very early, but so far the demand has been highest for our large appliances and home theater categories. We are also back in customers\u2019 homes, providing valuable services like large product delivery, installations, and in-home repairs in approximately 80% of US ZIP codes. We are doing this in a new and innovative way, using safety guidelines before, during, and after an in-home visit that meet or exceed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance. The key of course, is that we are providing options that let customers choose what works best for them. For the foreseeable future, we will likely employ a variety of models using our local level prowess to customize operations to the local situation. And we will continually evolve those operating models based on guidance from state and local governments as well as our own point of view on the proliferation of the virus and our ability to operate in a way that is safe for our employees and customers. I want to take some time to talk about our employees, clearly the Company's most important asset. From the very first days of the pandemic, we told anyone feeling sick or quarantined that they would keep their job and be paid. We told any employee whose child was home from school that they too would be paid. We gave all field employees who are still serving customers or working in our distribution centers, a temporary pay increase and for all others, we paid their normal salaries for a full month as we took the time to determine how to move forward. Throughout this difficult time of uncertainty and fast-paced change, we have been committed to communicating as often as possible with our employees. This includes conducting surveys on their need for flexibility, as well as their feelings on returning to work, so we can continue to improve our processes, facilitate the deliberate and measured return to corporate workspaces, and accommodate those with pre-existing conditions or safety concerns. Likewise, we built the protocols for returning to customers\u2019 homes and welcoming them back into our stores jointly with our field employees. We have created a robust feedback group and we connect regularly with other field employees to hear how things are going and solicit immediate feedback to challenges they face iterating the experience as we go. We've also continued our focus on providing crucial employee benefits and resources like those for mental and financial health, recognizing that the circumstances we each face are far more stressful than any of us may fully realize. Like most companies, we have had to make tough decisions including those Matt will touch on regarding the ways in which we have cut costs and preserve liquidity to ensure that at the end of this crisis Best Buy remains a strong, vibrant company. I personally want to touch on the difficult decision to furlough employees. While we were pleased to retain more than 80% of our revenue while our stores were closed to customer traffic, the fact remains that we did this without a single store open to customers. Given this fact, it is clear that the current models we are operating simply don't require the staffing our stores had before this crisis began. In that context, on April 19th, we furloughed approximately 51,000 domestic hourly store employees, including nearly all part time employees, we retained approximately 82% of our full time store and field employees on our payroll, including the vast majority of In-Home Advisors, and Geek Squad agents. Additionally, some corporate employees are participating in voluntary reduced work weeks and resulting pay as well as voluntary furloughs. We have done our best to provide these employees with resources and tools to help them navigate a situation that is undoubtedly new to all of them. In keeping with our view that all of us are in this together, I am foregoing 50% of my base salary and the members of the Board of Directors are forgoing 50% of their cash retainer fees. Company executives reporting directly to me are also taking a 20% reduction in base salary. The money saved from these temporary pay reductions is being added to the employee hardship fund we established with our founder, Dick Schulze. This fund was initially created for our furloughed employees as a way of providing them emergency funds, should they be required. I would now like to provide an update from a strategic lens. Last September, we hosted an investor update meeting to provide additional insights into our strategy. Despite the disruption and uncertainty related to COVID-19, we remain focused on executing our Building the New Blue strategy. In many ways, our current way of life in our homes, reliance on technology has only reinforced our belief in our strategic direction. We firmly believe our strategy will uniquely position us over the long term by leveraging our unique combination of tech and touch to meet everyday human needs and build more and deeper relationships with customers. Many of these capabilities and initiatives we laid out on stage in September are the muscles we're flexing right now. Our multiyear supply chain transformation has been focused on moving facilities closer to our customers, and using automation and process improvements, to expand fulfillment options, increase delivery speed, and improve the delivery and installation experience. This has included significantly improving the buy online, pickup in store experience for our customers. At the same time, we have been innovating and designing digital experiences that solve customer needs across online and physical shopping. As a result, the team was very quickly able to stand up a robust and seamless customer experience for both the curbside pickup process and the new in-store consultation process. All of this culminated in domestic online growth of 155% for the quarter. And during the six weeks we ran our curbside-only model, domestic online sales were up more than 300% compared to last year. Almost 50% of those sales were from customers choosing to pick up their products curbside at our stores. Customer satisfaction scores for the curbside pickup experience remained strong with more than 83% of those surveyed indicating they are extremely likely to recommend Best Buy based on their curbside experience. As it relates to supply chain, let me say first that since the beginning of the pandemic, we\u2019ve taken a variety of steps to create the safest possible experience for the employees in our distribution centers, while also ensuring that we're still able to deliver to customers with speed. Additionally, the infrastructure and capabilities we have built to thrive during peak holiday periods is serving us well. Even with the sustained online growth levels of approximately 350% during the last three weeks of the quarter, we did not have material disruptions and maintained our levels of fast service. We will continue to invest in all of these capabilities that focus on the customer experience, and that are designed to provide choice, speed and now safety. We will also of course continue to bring our deep CE expertise and unique ability to partner with vendors to commercialize their new technology, offering customers great products and solutions. In fact, in Q1, we saw a significant increase in demand for our expanded assortment of digital health and fitness products, including things such as at-home fitness equipment, and fitness recovery products that truly empower customers to take care of their own health at home. We believe that not only will technology innovation continue, it will accelerate as a result of the pandemic. We believe many of the customer behavior changes resulting from this type of stay-at-home orders will continue to exist moving forward. Best Buy and our vendor partners are rapidly adjusting our offerings to support these new needs in areas like video conferencing, food preparation and storage, and family entertainment. Turning to our in-home consultation service. In mid-March, we pivoted to provide consultations on a digital basis only. We are proud of the nimble way our team quickly transitioned to this alternative way of interacting with customers. And we're pleased with the number of consultations that took place this way. Because of our investments in the technology backbone, our in-home advisors were able to remain productive during this time and continue to provide customers a high level of consultation service. With our Geek Squad, we are in a unique position to help people productively work and learn in their homes. While overall Q1 interactions with our total tech support customers were down compared to last year, as are in-store and in-home services were unavailable, our remote technical support provided a critically stable support solution through these challenging times. In addition, we've cross trained our Geek Squad agents to work in our call centers, providing crucial phone and chat support to solve a variety of customer needs. We also utilized our Geek Squad agents to support our online customer experience by making same-day deliveries to customers\u2019 homes from 200 of our stores. As we moved back into homes and welcome customers back into our stores, demand for our services has been very high. Turning to Best Buy Health, our focus on health, in particular helping seniors live more independently with our unique combination of tech and touch has become even more relevant as the world responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Q1, to support our base of over 1 million seniors, we moved quickly to adapt our operations to our caring center agents to support more than 150,000 calls each week while complying with stay-at-home orders. The time spent by our agents on the phone with our customers was above the normal average at over nine minutes per call in many weeks, as we took the time to ensure we are answering questions and addressing requests to our fullest ability. Our service during this period averaged an NPS of 80. And we are incredibly proud of our caring center agents and the empathy with which they serve this vulnerable population, especially during this time. We also have the opportunity to help our commercial partners manage through this time with the help of technology. A recent example is holiday retirement, a leading senior living community where 29,000 residents have been outfitted with our lively mobile personal emergency response or PERS devices. These devices provide access to our emergency response service at the press of a button. We work with Holiday to leverage these devices to efficiently broadcast timely information and protocols related to COVID shelter-in-place to the senior residents. Lastly, we continue to build out our capabilities as we execute our long-term health strategy. Data is an essential currency of this strategy and we recently entered into an important partnership on that front. Validic is an industry-leading technology platform that aggregates data from everyday connected devices in the home, processes it and then provides meaningful insights. Together with Validic, we are bringing to market innovative remote monitoring solutions to better manage chronic health conditions in the home. In conclusion, we entered the year with financial and strategic momentum and a strong balance sheet. We have a suite of assets that allow us to uniquely and safely serve our customers in whatever way they choose, whether that's curbside pickup, free next day shipping, remote technical advice and support, virtual consultations, in-store appointments, in-home installations or doorstep delivery. We know customers and employees will have different shopping expectations anchored in safe environments and processes. We hope to set the standard for safe retailing by constantly adapting our model, leveraging and building on our unique suite of assets. The environment continues to evolve. And while there are many models and a great deal of speculation, there is still a high level of uncertainty at both the micro and macro levels. With that said, we are scenario planning in a way that addresses a number of variables. First, meaningful unemployment will almost certainly be with us through the fiscal year, not necessarily at the level we are seeing now, but enough to likely have a downward macroeconomic effect. Second, it will be important for us and any retailer to have a flexible enough operating model to accommodate the possibility that some states will continue to relax restrictions, while others at the same time may find themselves needing to tighten similar restrictions on how consumers engage with each other and local businesses. Finally, we will continue to prioritize customer and employee safety, advocating for preventative measures, such as social distancing and masks for both customers and employees. It is our belief that these measures will continue into the foreseeable future and will allow us to do what we promise at the very beginning of this crisis. Be there for our customers in as many ways as possible, while ensuring customers and our employees remain as safe as possible. As challenging as the current situation is, I am certain Best Buy will remain a strong vibrant company that is well positioned to deliver on our purpose and thrive in a new and different environments. In fact, we have taken the opportunity to move faster as this environment accelerates changes in the ways customers want to interact with retailers. For example, we were already preparing to roll out curbside service, store consultations and certified cross training of employees. As such, the implementation of these capabilities is not just a response to the pandemic, they are in fact an acceleration of our existing strategy. Lastly, and very importantly, I want to take this moment to thank the thousands of employees that have made this all possible. They have faced immense change with grit, determination and compassion, and have helped us shape our approach to safe retailing. Many are working with customers every day, some of whom are also scared, frustrated and occasionally hostile in this COVID environment, to ensure they have access to the products and services they need to work, learn, entertain and connect from home. Others are working tirelessly to maintain the supply chain that delivers with speed and keeps our customers at home. And so, many employees are making technical and operational changes every hour from their home office. None of this is possible without their dedication, and I am truly grateful and feel lucky to be on the team with them. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our Q1 financial results. Matt Bilunas : Good morning. As Corie described, the pandemic has dramatically changed how we interact with our customers. We are thoughtfully approaching each decision, balancing the safety of our employees and customers while creating long-term value for our shareholders.  Even with the outstanding execution from our employees and a strong customer demand for the essential technology we provide, there is no denying the financial impact the pandemic has had. In Q1, the stay-at-home orders and changes to our operating models resulted in an immediate and complete channel shift that put near term pressure on our operating income rates. Online revenue was up more than 155% year-over-year and was 42% of domestic revenue compared to 15% last year. In a typical quarter, the operating income rate in the store and online channel are very similar, as we find the lower gross profit rate online offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of sales compared to our store channel. In Q1, our enterprise gross profit rate was approximately 70 basis points lower than last year as we incurred higher supply chain costs to fulfill the online sales. In addition, while we took numerous steps to control costs and manage profitability in the quarter, we continued to incur the majority of the cost to run stores, including payroll and rents. In fact, we continued to pay our field associates in some cases at a higher rate through most of the quarter. Therefore, we did not see the SG&A leverage we would expect with a more gradual shift of sales between channels. As a result, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate declined 90 basis points was driven by both a lower gross profit rate and unfavorable SG&A rate compared to last year. Before I talk about our first quarter results in more detail, let me start with a reminder that on March 21st, we withdrew our fiscal '21 guidance for both the first quarter and the full year due to the uncertainty related to the potential impacts associated with COVID-19 pandemic. I would now like to provide additional details on our results versus last year. Starting with how sales trended during the quarter. As we reported in our April 15th press release, our enterprise revenue was up 4% year-over-year for the first seven weeks of the quarter ended March 20th. This was ahead of our regional expectations. As in mid-March, we began to see the surge in demand for products that people needed to work or learn from home, as well as gaming products. In fact, during the eight days ended March 20th, our enterprise revenue grew approximately 25% year-over-year. While we continue to see heightened demand for these products, we materially changed our operating model. And therefore, we began to experience overall revenue declines. As a result, in the first three weeks of the new model from March 21 to April 11, revenue declined approximately 30% compared to last year. In the last three weeks of the quarter from April 12 through May 2nd, sales trends improved as stimulus funding began to circulate. As a result, during that time period, revenue declined approximately 8% compared to last year. In our domestic segment, revenue for the total quarter decreased 6.7% to $7.9 billion. The decrease was driven by comparable sales decline of 5.7% and the loss of revenue from 24 large format stores that were closed in the past year as part of our normal course of business. Our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed, or operating in our curbside only operating model during the period as a result of COVID-19. From a merchandise perspective, as Corie mentioned, we saw growth in our computing and gaming categories. This growth was more than offset by declines in home theater, mobile phones and digital imaging. In addition, comparable sales in the services category declined 16%. The decline in services was primarily due to store closures and the corresponding higher mix of online sales, which has a lower attach rate than in-store as well as the fact that we suspended in-home services midway into the quarter. In our international segment, revenue decreased 2.1% to $647 million, primarily driven by approximately 320 basis points of negative foreign currency impact, which was partially offset by revenue from new stores opened in Mexico in the past year. Our international comparable sales were essentially flat to last year, even though all stores in Canada were close to customer traffic for approximately 40% of the quarter, similar to the U.S. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rates declined 70 basis points to 23%. As I stated earlier, the decrease was primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with the higher mix of online revenue. We also saw lower profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement and product mix pressure. But, these impacts were largely offset by lower promotional activity across multiple categories. The impact from the lower profit share revenue was approximately 20 basis points compared to last year. We expect to see continued pressure from lower profit sharing revenue related to our private label and co-branded credit card arrangements, as the economic ramifications of COVID-19 are expected to lead to higher credit card defaults over time. International gross profit rate decreased a 190 basis points to 22.3%, primarily due to lower year-over-year gross profit rates in Canada, the result of a lower mix, higher margin services revenue and higher supply chain costs. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A decreased $101 million compared to last year. And as a percentage of revenue, SG&A increased approximately 10 basis points to 19.7%. The largest driver of the expense decline was lower incentive compensation expense of approximately $70 million. The majority of this was related to short-term incentive compensation as we did not pay or accrue bonuses for first quarter performance. We also incurred lower store payroll expense due to the federal CARES Act Employee Retention Tax Credit. As Corie stated, we continued paying all of our store associates through April 18th, whether they were working or not, and we paid hourly incentive pay to employees who were working in our stores and distribution centers. We also incurred additional costs such as safety measures and supplies associated with actions we took in response to the pandemic. In the quarter, we incurred approximately $200 million of costs related to our COVID-19-related actions, or approximately $131 million when including the Employee Retention Credit of $69 million. This Employee Retention Credit is a payroll tax credit for approximately 50% of qualified wages and health benefits paid to retained employees not working as a result of COVID-19. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate of 27.2% compared to 20.1% last year. The increase versus last year was primarily driven by a decrease in the tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our enterprise non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.67 includes a negative $0.07 per share impact from the higher tax rate and a negative $0.02 per share impact from higher net interest expense, partially offset by a $0.03 per share benefit from a net share account change. During the first quarter, we returned $203 million to shareholders through $141 million in dividends and $62 million in share repurchases. As we previously communicated, we suspended share repurchases on March 21st. We have taken and are taking a number of additional actions to bolster the balance sheet to provide flexibility, including drawing the full amount of our $1.25 billion credit facility on March 19th. Other actions include lowering merchandise receipts to match demand, which resulted in a 23% decline in our Q1 ending inventory balance compared to last year, reducing promotional and marketing spend to align with our temporary operating model, and suspending our 401(k) company matching program. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we are reducing our spend to focus on mandatory maintenance or high value strategic areas. When we entered the year, our outlook we shared was to spend between $800 million and $900 million in capital expenditures during fiscal \u201821. We now expect the spend in the range of $650 million and $750 million. We remain committed to spend in areas such as technology, automation and our health strategy. We are deferring spend in areas like store remodels and we're reducing the number of stores receiving electronic sign labels this year. As a result of the ongoing uncertainty related to COVID-19, we are not providing financial guidance at this time. However, I would like to provide some insight into how we're thinking about Q2 and the rest of the year. Our priority has been and will continue to be the safety of our employees and customers while providing essential products and services. We are focused on managing our profitability and liquidity, balancing our short-term decisions to navigate this unprecedented situation, while preserving elements of our strategy that will ensure we remain a vibrant company in the future. For the remainder of the year, there are many factors we're continuing to weigh, including one, the depth and duration of the pandemic; two, the impact of current and potential future government stimulus actions; three, the impact to consumer and growing unemployment; four, the evolution of our various operating models; and five, how and where our customers are choosing to interact with us. It is difficult for us or anyone else for that matter to model how long this continues and the extent to which economy moves into a prolonged recession. In the first two weeks of Q2, we have retained approximately 95% of sales compared to last year. We would expect that our Q2 sales growth rate will likely continue to be pressured throughout the quarter. We also expect our online sales would continue to be high as a percentage of overall sales in the second quarter, which will continue to pressure the gross profit rate. While we do expect to see lower payroll and short term incentive costs, we will continue to have some costs associated with a longer term operating model such as store rent expense, and continued rate pressure from lower profit sharing revenue related to our credit card arrangement. Therefore, we still expect our Q2 operating income rate will decline on a year-over-year basis. Lastly, as Corie mentioned, we will likely employ a variety of operating models during the second quarter, all adapted to the local market conditions and emphasizing safety for our customers and employees. To the extent we're able to increase the level of customer traffic in our stores by expanding hours or opening some stores beyond our current appointment-only model, we may reduce the operating income rate pressure by expanding your gross margins and further leveraging SG&A. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich : Hi. Thanks, and great job pulling this all together. I'd love to dig a little more into the supply chain and the inventory down 23%. Could you go into a little bit more on which categories you've been able to secure products and then which ones that you think it might be more challenging, particularly as we think about back-to-school coming up in a couple of months? Matt Bilunas : Sure. I'll start and then maybe Mike can jump in. I think, overall we think the teams did an amazing job balancing inventory through the quarter. We've clearly had a number of different sales trajectories through the quarter. So, in the quarter, we likely saw some constraints in some key areas such as computing and gaming, but we were able to manage through that quite well. I think overall, we're pleased with the way the teams managed through inventory. And as we look into Q2, I would say we'll continue to see a little bit of constraints going into the quarter but likely nothing to impact that we saw in Q1. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you have anything? Mike Mohan : Yes. Thanks, Matt. And Greg, thanks for the question. And maybe, just a little bit of backdrop. Before the pandemic started, we were dealing with the tariff situation from last year. And so, our teams have been working tirelessly around countries of origin and are sourcing from all of our partners. I felt really good as we entered the year as to where we were from an inventory position. Some of the categories that saw the demand spike, freezer saw demand spike, some network equipment saw demand spike, some of the computing products, monitors. Things that you would actually need to work more from home or learn from home were the ones that got constrained and the ones that we\u2019re working the fastest to be back in stock. Based on what we have visibility to and work with our top partners, we feel really good about our inventory position from here going through the balance of the quarter. We now have to plan back to school during the pandemic, which is also new to all of us too. But, I feel good where we're at with the work with our partners. Greg Melich : And if I could just follow up on that. What would be the ideal amount of inventory? Was any of that reduction just because sales were down, or was it really just to get into the supply? Would you like inventory to be flat year-over-year? Matt Bilunas : Yes. I think it's a balance to answer that question. We clearly reduced inventory to match the sales trajectory, but we also wanted to make sure we're finding the inventory for the products that were in high demand, like computing. And so, you tend to look for areas that aren\u2019t -- where the trajectory is not as high, and you right size as much as you can and continue to find the products that are in high demand. So, ideally we'd like to have more computing in -- some more inventory in some areas, because we probably could have seen more sales if had -- we had it is the answer. Greg Melich : That's great. Good luck to everyone. Thanks. Corie Barry : Thank you. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : We will now move to our next question from Karen Short from Barclays. Please go ahead. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations, obviously, on working through a very volatile time. Corie Barry : Thank you, Karen. Karen Short : So, I just wanted to ask a little bit on I guess the reintroduction of services. I guess, could you give a little color on the demand you're seeing for IHAs and also total tech support. Because I guess there's two sides of the debate, which is one that pent-up demand that got pulled into 1Q. But then, the other side of it is, people could do wholesale, like home office reconfigurations just beyond a replacement laptop or printer, I mean, even more complicated types of overhaul. So, if you could give a little color on that, and then I had another follow-up. Corie Barry : So, I\u2019ll try to give a little color on both TTS and IHA. So, we talked about it a bit in the script. We did definitely see some usage, but the majority of it was remote or via chats and call, because obviously you couldn't come into the stores and we couldn't go into your homes. And so, not only were we constrained by a bit of what you're talking about, Karen, which is you can only put so much to your home office together, we were also just constrained by the way we were operating. And I think we've talked about this before, this severe of a channel shift makes service sales harder than when we have our stores open and when we have a chance to provide that service. We are definitely seeing pent-up demand as we start to open up our stores to the appointment model. Many of the appointments being made are people who want to come in and bring, especially as you can imagine home office or phone products in for us to help take care of them. And we can also see as we're going back into people's homes where the demand and request for us to come to their homes to fix things like refrigerators, laundry, that has been very high. And so, I think there is definitely pent-up demand there as we\u2019re heading into Q2 and the team is finding new ways to serve that. On the IHA side of things, it was very interesting. The team across all of our in-home businesses has been very flexibly trying to serve customers, either digitally, phone, chat, any way that they can. They moved -- IHA moved to digital consultations in mid-March. Our IHAs are also helping with this really heavy volume of inbound sales calls and chats, and they are also helping with the new in-store consultation model. Before you come to the store, we actually have a pre-call. And our In-Home Advisors in some cases are helping with that pre-call because we can really figure out what it is that a customer needs. I will say, if I just were to give a couple data points, in April, we saw our IHA business was actually up. And over 60% of that was coming from chat and digital channel. And that through those channels, those virtual consultations was at a 91 NPS. So, this idea that we can more flexibly use the in-home resources, not just physically in people's homes, but in a more virtual consultative way is really, really interesting and something that I think will be a muscle we can see the flex as we go forward. Karen Short : Actually that leads into my next question. I mean, looking at your very strong retention rates that have only gotten better, but also pairing that with the e-com now at 42% of sales, I guess, I'm wondering how you think about evaluating the physical store base going forward, just more broadly? Corie Barry : Yes. I will start with, our stores are absolutely an asset, and they have been an asset throughout this. And I\u2019ll just use a data point in April, 65% of what we sold online, which is the vast majority of what we sold, was either pickup curbside or shipped from a store. And so, this asset of the store base is very real. Now, you can imagine what we're discerning is how might the stores look and work differently in the future? And how might they provide a variety of fulfillment options, a variety of service and high touch consultative options, like this opens a lot of doors for how your stores might work differently. And that's where our focus is at this point. Karen Short : Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Curtis Nagle from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Curtis Nagle from Bank of America, please ensure you're not on mute. We currently can't hear you. Curtis Nagle : Apologies. I was on mute. Thanks very much for taking the question. Corie, maybe just quickly, just digging back into the point on sales in May so far. So, down, I guess about only 5% that is an acceleration, really, really impressive numbers. Would you be able to talk about what's driving that? Is that further acceleration in online, better curbside? I mean, what's going on there? Corie Barry : I'll start. And then, maybe Matt can add more color because I'm sure I\u2019ll miss something. I think there's a lot that's going on there. So, curbside, even if you look at the original retention we announced at the beginning of curbside, which is around 70%, you can tell that accelerate because by the end of the quarter, we were already at 81%. And so, just I think the performance overarching, we have curbside, the teams were amazingly creative and thoughtful about how they implemented that and definitely got better and better and better at providing that service. We also were very clear that stimulus dollars that started to flow towards the end of the quarter were absolutely helpful. And those lines strongly believe are carrying in Q2 here. It\u2019s not all the checks have yet been distributed, although the vast majority now of that money is out there. But we definitely see those stimulus starts buoying the level of demand. And then, I think people continue to have more needs as they spend more and more time in their homes. The initial demand will be definitely around working and learning from home. And this new appointment model, what we're starting to see is there is also demand for cooking. And importantly, I think we all feel it, entertaining at home and creating new and different entertaining theaters, kind of what we've seen in gaming. And so, I think there is also that once you layer on a little bit of a point [Technical Difficulty], you also start to see the demand for some of the other aspects of what it means to be sheltering in place time. Matt, I don\u2019t know if you anything to add? Matt Bilunas : No. I would say, -- I think just in general too, as we become more proficient in our model and customers are more comfortable as they engage with us. I think there's a general improvement in our execution and just how customers learning how to shop in this new environment. Corie Barry : Yes. I think that\u2019s a really good point I would just lift up. Our teams have done an amazing job on awareness to how to shop. If you go to our website, we have literally a whole site that just walks through all the different ways in which you can interact with Best Buy, and then what's applicable depending on your geography. And you can imagine that's going to take some time for our customers to understand and actually have awareness of all the different ways they can shop Best Buy. Curtis Nagle : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then, maybe just a quick one and perhaps its\u2019 a bit early to comment on. But, could you talk a little bit about some of the changes you might be making in terms of your in-store product assortment to maybe better cater to people living and staying in their homes more? You'd mentioned health products or fitness products as an example. Yes. How could the stores change over the kind of the coming months, years going forward? Mike Mohan : Hey. Curtis, this is Mike. I\u2019ll start and Matt or Corie can chime in. We look at the customer demand signals all the time. And what I think is interesting during this pandemic, the idea of we\u2019re trying to play and I'm going specific to health, we've always had an insight that acknowledges we\u2019re playing a strong role in helping enrich people's lives, and I was at a predisposition around acquisition of GreatCall, how we thought about that space. And people are really thinking about what else they should or could be doing at home. Things in that space definitely have propped. It\u2019s still a small business for us. But that's why we got into the fitness category last year, because that has been significantly in their demand. But, then things oxygen sensors, thermometers and things that you would want to do to just to check and maintain your health becoming more important because those devices, while they serve a need are now starting to check other things consumers are highly interested in, which I think bodes extremely well for Best Buy. The gaming resurgence was a bit of a surprise, I'll be candid. Everyone had thought that gaming category was going to wait for this fall for the new console resets. But clearly, if you have kids at home and you cannot be the best teacher in the world, a substitute has become a Nintendo Switch or an Xbox or Playstation. And that's new demand. And we think that demand will actually be leading to stronger demand as the year progresses with new devices. And the category that I'm intrigued about as we get back to people working with us that we're going into their homes, so we intend to go back into people's homes with IHAs in early June. But as people come to our stores for consultations, is people thinking about how to update the way they prepare food and store it and how they're thinking about entertainment. So, the categories that we're really good at, these complex, highly consultative sales, I think there's some good opportunities in our assortment there. Maybe more curated but also serving customers\u2019 needs more specifically as they look for doing different things. Corie Barry : The only thing that I would add is to build on Karen Short\u2019s question just a little bit. I think the complex, full home office and learning solutions will also continue. I think, people have been piecing together kind of what they can to make it work, as I believe work from home becomes a more sustainable practice. I think, these more fulsome approaches to home office will be really important. Operator : We will now take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets, Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Scott Ciccarelli. You guys talk about getting a from the stimulus checks. That makes sense. I think a lot of companies did. But, do you have any way to estimate the amount of pull forward demand you may have benefited from in the quarter as you try and kind of think about the balance of the year? Matt Bilunas : Yes. I\u2019ll start, and maybe Mike or Corie can jump in. I think, we actually don't believe there was much pull forward into the quarter. I think, if you think about the types of products we were selling, there\u2019s continued sustained demand that we're seeing. I think people's lives have also changed in a way that demand that they probably didn't know they had before, they now have in a new world where technology at home is more important, things like monitors at home that you may not have -- would have bought. So, I think -- we actually think a lot of what we\u2019re seeing or most of what we're seeing is not pull forward as much as it is incremental to an otherwise different situation. Corie Barry : I think, Mike\u2019s gaming example is the perfect one, meaning that\u2019s not pull forward demand. That\u2019s demand that would not have existed. People would not have bought those gaming consoles. They would have waited for the next generation of consoles to come in December. But because you're in this unique life situation, there's real incremental demand there. And I think that's the perfect example of what we're seeing. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. And then, as you talk with your vendors, obviously, you've had a lot of discussions with them, given some of your inventory commentary. Everyone's been on hold, right? So, based on what you know at this point, is there any kind of change to what's called the product introduction outlook as you discussed with your vendors, kind of the way they're thinking about the balance of the year? Thanks. Mike Mohan : Scot, it's Mike. No, I don't see any change to some of the known parts of everyday. There's lots of things that even we don't know. But, we made a statement in the script. We think innovation is going to accelerate. There are some product categories in the ways that things come to light that I think are meaningful. I mean, literally four months ago, most people who had front-facing video camera on their laptop was putting a piece of paper over it. And now you need a higher resolution camera, and better set of speakers and microphone because you need to be more productive and doing video conferencing. So, I'm actually pretty excited about maybe some additional innovation or some product revs that we could help accelerate and commercialize and bring to market. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Many thanks. Mike Mohan : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan Matuszewski : Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Curious, if you could give us an update on your lease to own effort, presumably something that's been more challenging to facilitate with kind of limited store operations. But, how do you see that evolving, especially with underbanked consumers, maybe feeling their wallets pinched a bit? And, any commentary on what you were able to see during the quarter? Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Sure. Yes, absolutely. I think, the ability to provide another purchasing option for customers is critically important, especially in this very uncertain time for most people. The reality is in this quarter, currently customers can only purchase through lease to own in our stores. And so, it obviously hasn't made that program advanced too much in the quarter. We're still expecting to launch it online this year and I think that\u2019s in July. So, we're still very pleased about the relationships, we're still very excited about the opportunity to provide and extending more financing to more people and the customers that it might attract. But clearly, in a quarter, a bit of a disruption just due to the fact that our stores were closed to foot traffic for half of it. Jonathan Matuszewski : Yes. That's helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. Since the pandemic started, have you seen any evidence of trade down? Obviously, you're seeing indications of demand across categories. But, any indications in terms of moving towards smaller versions of appliances or less features or last year's models, or anything like that that would indicate consumer caution? Thanks. Corie Barry : I\u2019ll start and Mike can pile on. I don't -- we really for the most part have not. Now, back to what Mike said about the need around your home office or the need around learning, when you're purchasing in that very kind of needs-based way, it's less about trying to trade down, it's more about trying to figure out what exactly is going to fulfill the need for you in your home. That's actually we\u2019re seeing in cooking and preparing food at home, we\u2019re seeing it in learning in office at home. And so, I think for us, we're actually right now seeing the demand is across the profile of what we sell, and in fact, in some spaces even higher in some of the higher end computing. I think, one of the things that's selling really well in computing is high computing, that\u2019s gaming computing. In gaming computing, is actually some of the highest end products that we sell. And you can definitely see that people as they get bored in their home are looking for some ways to entertain themselves and have not been looking for the cheapest way to do that. Mike Mohan : The only thing I'd add Jonathan is during the timeframe a couple of the mass channel retailers were open. So, from an assortment and a comparability standpoint, consumers didn't have a wholesome shopping experience. There's a couple of examples where on constrained products, there probably was some ASP erosion based on the fact that all you had were lower price items. And that sometimes is very temporary where somebody would trade down, but that's not indicative of a long-term trend in any way, shape or form. The best example is having consultations back in place for the some hundred stores, and the interest level we're seeing for consumers in some of our more complex categories. Jonathan Matuszewski : Really helpful. Thanks for the color. Mike Mohan : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Joe Feldman : Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. I want to follow-up on the CapEx reduction. I know you described a little bit on the call, but -- in the prepared remarks. But can you help us better understand, like, what are you cutting and what are you keeping? I mean, because it's a vast majority of it, you're still going to be spending this year. I'm just wondering where that is relative to the cuts. Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Sure. I\u2019ll start. And maybe Corie and Mike can jump in. I think where we've tried to cut from a CapEx perspective is mostly around discretionary, non-essential things. And actually, the fact that our stores have been closed to foot traffic for quite a while, I think there's some things that like store remodels don't make as much sense in the middle of what we're dealing with as they would otherwise. So, store remodels have been paused. We've lowered the amount of electronic sign labels that we were going to put in our stores, simply because there's an issue of just when we can actually accomplish that in the year. So, there's more discretionary items that are as essential during this period that we've decided to pull back on. But there's a continuation of strategies because we still believe we are very relevant to the customer and our strategies are very applicable going forward, if not more. So, there's things like automation and just dotcom technology and other things that we are just as passionate as we were before about it. And we will continue to invest where we can to drive and accelerate our strategies. Corie Barry : We said it on the call, our investment in digital and supply chain automation technologies are a huge part of what allowed us to first move to curbside and then set up appointment based scheduling. Both of those required heavy digital builds behind the scenes in order to make an app as an example ready for a customer to make an appointment or for an employee to be able to see who's in the queue waiting for an appointment. And we believe continued investment in those experiences that are going to deliver choice to customers and continue to deliver with speed are absolutely crucial to maintaining our positioning as the year goes on here. Joe Feldman : Thanks. And if I could ask you one more? With regard to the 40 stores that are closed, I know you guys decided to close those and they still remain closed. Will those reopen or are you thinking those were kind of weaker stores that you may take advantage of the situation and keep them closed for now? Corie Barry : No, they're not weaker stories. These are literally for the most part it\u2019s us looking at kind of spread of the virus and our available employee population. In a lot of cases, they are actually some of the bigger stores, on the East Coast you can imagine are some that we've either closed or in a couple of situations we still have some government mandates. But don\u2019t take those 40 as they're underperforming. These are literally 40 that just it makes a lot of sense based on health, safety and government regulations. Joe Feldman : Thanks. And good luck with this quarter, guys. Thanks. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : We will now take our next question from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone. First, a strategic question on healthcare initiatives. It feels like -- it seems like it's a pretty good moment to advance some of those strategies. Can you talk about anything with regard to user trend, level of interest in those business models and the degree to which you can accelerate some of those -- some of that business segment? Corie Barry : I'm going to start by building on where Mike had left off, on the consumer side of health. And I'm going to think about this writ large, everything from kind of health and fitness, all the way to taking your temperature and blood pressure cuffs. There is significant demand for technology that will help us maintain and monitor our health at home. And we have seen that across the board. And this is just hypothesis. But my personal hypothesis would be back to the point we were talking about earlier, the level of innovation in health at home is only going to accelerate from here. Not just because people want it but also because what you've seen is a change in reimbursement for telehealth at the overarching kind of government level. And so, that combination of things is incredibly powerful on the consumer side. Now, of course, it\u2019s a little tricky there as it relates to specifically our GreatCall devices, the phones, the wearable devices, much of those sales go through our stores. And so, without our stores physically being open, it's little harder to transact that online. So, but in the moment pressure we're feeling is a little bit around our stores not being open. But the potential for devices that are going to keep us connected to our -- especially elderly loved ones right now and also just keep us connected is incredibly high. We hit a little bit on the commercial side in the script. You can imagine there's a great deal of interest around how at a much broader scale we can monitor people's health and take care of them in their homes. If this pandemic has highlighted anything, it is keeping people at home as long as possible, but it's also tracking their vitals, tracking how they're feeling is incredibly important. So, the potential on commercial I think has come to light even faster. And this was our hypothesis that more people would need to have more care in their homes on the back of technology. And I think this has accelerated that hypothesis meaningfully. Simeon Gutman : Makes sense. Can I follow up on gross margin? The pressure you saw related to supply chain, the mix shift, was that normal course of mix shift or this was a triage situation? And then, the other question is the credit card. Is there any way you can dimensionalize the impact from lower profit share? I realize you did this quarter, but the go forward, if delinquencies grow a certain percentage, we could see a certain percentage impact to your P&L? Matt Bilunas : Yes. Thank you. On the gross margin side channel, so obviously in the quarter, about halfway through, we shifted to filling mostly through -- or actually selling mostly through online channel and fulfilling through our stores in the large percentage of cases. When that happens, if you incur a much higher personal expense, even though a large number of customers are still deciding to come pick up at our stores, and actually our stores are stilling fulfilling a large percent of those products, almost 65% of what's actually happening in the quarter was either picked up at our stores curbside and/or shipped out of our stores. So, with that parcel costs just go up. That's kind of a variable cost of online. It wasn't abnormal with that shift. It was just the normal shift to that channel when it happens. So, we would expect that to continue as we look into Q2. Obviously half of our Q1 was under the old model, then we had -- saw the dramatic increase. We still expect online, as we said, to be significantly higher in Q2, which would means we would incur some additional parcel costs and more gross profit pressure because of it. We have never given on the financing profit share. We've never given the actual number what the profit share is. We did discuss or say that it was 20 basis points of pressure in Q1. I think, we also believe it will be a pressure in Q2. I would expect it to be pretty consistent, if not, maybe a little bit more in Q2, as you look forward. Hard to know how that plays out for the whole year because a big part of this has to do with the macro and unemployment, and we are -- little too early to tell how much that actually is going to be an impact for the year. But we would expect it to be a pressure. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thank you. Good luck. Corie Barry : Thank you so much. And with that, I think that ends our call for today. Thank you all so much for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our progress again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call.

I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting strong quarterly results and we are encouraged to see the customer demand for our products and services. I'm proud of the amazing execution of our teams to these unprecedented times. However, we have not lost sight of the fact that people continue to suffer and we extend our sympathy to all those who have lost someone to the virus, are sick with COVID-19 or are facing financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. From the very start of this crisis, we've been focused on the guiding the business with two goals in mind. First, ensuring the health and safety of our customers and employees while protecting the employee experience as much as possible; and second, making certain we come out of this moment, a strong, innovative company. The results we are reporting today would not be possible without the effort and energy of our frontline employees working in our stores, supply chain facilities and customers home. I want to thank all our employees for their tremendous commitment to our customers and for living our purpose to enrich lives through technology. They are navigating not only the impacts of the pandemic, but also fires, hurricanes and civil unrest. Their willingness even enthusiasm to continually adapt as we manage through the evolving environment has been extraordinary. For our second quarter, we are reporting revenue of $9.9 billion, which is growth of approximately 4% from the second quarter of last year. Our Q2, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.71 compared to $1.08 last year. Enterprise comparable sales growth was 5.8%, despite the fact that our stores were opened by appointment-only for the first six weeks of the quarter. Products that help people work, learn, connect and cook at home, like computing, appliances and tablets were the biggest drivers of our sales growth. Trends across most categories improved materially throughout the quarter, as we opened our stores for shopping, especially categories like large appliances and home theater that benefit from more experiential shopping. We also saw very strong digital demand for some of our newer categories such as digital health and fitness, at-home fitness equipment, sustainable living, outdoor activities and camping equipment. While still relatively small categories from a revenue standpoint, they are extremely relevant in today's environment and highlight our ability to leverage our digital first mindset supported by our expertise around curation and supply chain. Throughout the quarter, we experienced inventory constraints in a number of categories, which did moderate our sales growth. While we expected product constraints as we entered the quarter, the stronger-than-anticipated demand as we open our stores for shopping resulted in more constrained product availability than we expected. Turning to profitability. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.9% expanded almost 200 basis points from last year, due to materially lower SG&A expense. The lower SG&A is a direct result of balanced but prudent decisions to lower costs in response to the uncertainty of the pandemic and our evolving operating model. That level of lower SG&A, for the most part, is not sustainable as we add labor hours in our stores, reinstate short-term incentive plans and increase advertising spend. Matt will provide more detail later, but we expect Q3 SG&A expense to be more in line with last year's third quarter. I would like to take a moment to recap the evolution of our store operating model. We ended Q1 in a curbside only model with no in-store customer shopping. At the beginning of Q2, we started welcoming customers back into our stores by offering an in-store consultation service to customers by appointment only.  On June 15, we began allowing customers to shop without an appointment at more than 800 stores across the U.S. and as of June 22, almost all of our stores were open for shopping. At that time, approximately half of the 51,000 associates we had in furloughed in April returned. We also resumed our in-home sales consultations, adding to the other in-home services we provide like delivery, installation and repair, we had previously resumed back in May. As we reopened our stores, we saw considerable demand from customers to clearly value and want an in-store shopping experience. Prior to reopening, we were retaining approximately 92% of last years' revenue at the start of Q2. Then, in the last seven weeks of the quarter, total sales grew 16% compared to the same period last year. Trends have remained strong in August, with sales up approximately 20% for the first three weeks of Q3, as customers demand for product special than work, learn and cook. To meet this increased demand, we have now returned approximately two-thirds of the furloughed associates. Throughout this time period and across the ways customers can shop, we have continued to adhere to safety protocols that limit capacity, follow strict social distancing practices and use proper protective equipment, including requiring our employees and customers to wear mask. Like many retailers, we\u2019re also operating at reduced store hours, we were operating with approximately 20% fewer hours than last year to match customer demand patterns. This pandemic and the swift shift in customer buying behavior really underscore the importance of our strong multichannel capabilities. For the full quarter, our domestic online revenue grew 240% from last year. Even when stores open for customer shopping, online sales growth continued to be extremely strong, in fact, last seven weeks of the quarter, online revenue grew approximately 180% over the same period last year. Domestic online sales have continued to be very strong in Q3 and are up approximately 175% for the first three weeks of August. We believe it is essentially to provide options that let customers choose what works best for them. We are continuing to provide fulfillment options, customers have come to expect from all retailers like fast and free home delivery, and buy online and pickup in store. We will also continue to provide great experiences like curbside pickup, in-store consultations, and of course, home installation of appliances, TVs, fitness equipments and more. And our digital experiences such as chatting with an expert or leveraging a digital consultation in your home to remain popular options. During the first half of the year, and responding to the pandemic, we made decisions across all these operating models that stressed safety. Although, we temporarily gave up some share while our stores were closed to customer traffic, according to our data, our share has largely recovered since reopening. Most importantly, we made the right decisions for our employees and customers. In Q2, more than 97% of customers surveyed indicated that that we made them feel safe and we believe the credibility we garnered will over time contribute to more brand love and thus more revenue. I would add that since the beginning of the pandemic, we have seen elevated growth in the number of new customers. And while it is still early, these new customers are showing a higher likelihood to return than new customers in the prior year period. As we look forward, the environment is still evolving and our operating model and supporting cost structure is evolving as well. The pandemic has accelerated the evolution of retail and compelled us to change our operating model in the best interest of our customers and employees. It has allowed us to expedite some planned strategic changes that will set us up to emerge from this time even stronger. I'd like to provide some insight into our approach, starting with three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and lead, not follow. Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers, while also providing more flexible opportunities for our people. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives due to the pandemic. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. Said differently, people are using technology to address their needs in ways they never contemplated before, and we play a vital role in bringing tech to life for both customers and our vendor partners. As you would imagine, these concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our business. These implications have been considered as we have made decisions throughout the course of the pandemic and will help our strategy for our future store design, our operating models and our digital investments. We will provide more examples as our plans evolve, but here are some initial thoughts on strategic implications over the next several quarters. From a store standpoint, we have been responding to the impacts from the pandemic in a way that has been enabled by tremendous flexibility at the local level. We are leveraging localized data and analytics that allow us to pilot various services like opening stores an hour earlier for consultations only. Using data and analytics also allows us to quickly and productively customize operations to the local situation if necessary. This is especially important for us to effectively respond should the virus flare up in certain markets. It is too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as a result of the pandemic, we expect it will be higher than it has been historically. As a result, we are starting to evolve the way we use our stores for fulfillment. For example, next month, we will be piloting a ship from store hub model to help handle significant volume pre-holiday and year-round. All our stores will still ship out online orders, but approximately 250 locations will be positioned to ship out significantly more volume. These locations were chosen for their space, proximity to carrier partners and ability to support same and next-day delivery. Over time, this should allow us to deliver a more productive fulfillment model. We are also continuing to add additional third party physical pickup locations for online orders to provide more flexibility and convenience for customers, and now have more than 16,000, covering 85% of the population within five miles. As it relates to our people, we are investing in compensation and beginning to incorporate elements of the flexible workforce, we first introduced at our Investor Day a year ago. We took a major step earlier this month by evolving the pay structure for our store employees and raising the starting wage to $15 per hour. Since the early stages of the pandemic, all hourly retail associates and supply chain employees who were working received incremental hourly appreciation pay. The incremental hourly appreciation pay started March 22 and ended August 1. On August 2, the beginning of our third quarter, we implemented a new pace structure that reflects an ongoing evolution and is the result of clear and consistent feedback from field employees across the country. To provide more predictability and pay, a 4% increase in hourly rate replaced short-term incentive compensation for hourly store employees below the leadership level. After the 4% hourly pay increase, employees were not yet at $15 per hour, had their pay increased to the $15 per hour starting wage. For field leadership and corporate employees, we are reinstituting short-term incentive compensation programs for the back half of the year. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've worked in partnership with our company founder, Dick Schulze to provide our employees with emergency financial assistance. Together, we've established two funds totaling more than $10 million, one for the benefit of any full or part-time employee meeting general financial help and a second for those who have become ill with the virus. We are also evolving the way we work to position employees to serve customers, based on need irrespective of channel. A few early examples include our consultation program and our Geek Squad agents. As most of you know, we launched our In-Home Advisor program a few years ago. At that time, the program consistent of highly trained individuals, who were strictly going into customers' homes to provide free comprehensive technology consultations. In May, we developed an in-store appointment engine, as we adapted our operating model to respond to the pandemic. As a result, our In-Home Advisor program has been worked into a consultation across all channels model. We now have a system with tiered advisors, which provides more opportunities for more employees by matching employees with the needs of the customer. And they can provide free consultation in stores, in homes and via phone or chat, depending on customer preferences. Our Geek Squad Agents are not only providing technical support to customers in stores, many of them have also been cross-trained to work in our call centers, providing crucial phone and chat support to solve a variety of customer needs. Another example of the way we are increasing the flexibility of our workforce is our store employees who are making same day deliveries to customers home from 200 of our stores. The examples I just showed have largely stemmed from our response to the pandemic. Going forward, we are on a path to develop a flexible workforce model that leverages technology and provides associates the ability to work whenever and wherever they want. Right now, we are building the foundation by leading our store employees through skills-based training for their existing rules. Overtime, there will be opportunities for employees to gain additional skill sets and be able to fulfill multiple rules which will lead to additional scheduling eligibility and flexibility. From a customer experience standpoint, our strategy is to not only keep pace with, but anticipate changes in customer expectations including safety by adopting a customer accessed approach that is primarily digital. I'll share a few examples of how this is showing up in our app, which saw the number of customer downloads double compared to last year. We are piloting more opportunities for virtual consultation, with our blue-shirts and in-home consultants including abilities to share live video. This is especially critical during the current environment, an increased need for remote consultation and assistance capabilities. We are also expanding our use of augmented reality in the shopping experience, so customers can more easily select the right products based on the space in their homes by using the camera on their own phone. For the in-store experience, we are piloting a self-service in aisle checkout for selected SKUs. This will allow a checkout process that is fast, convenient and involves minimal contact for customers. And for our curbside pickup experience, we are adding functionality that will display information about high and low traffic times and provide digital updates for customers when they are in the parking lot waiting for their curbside orders. We will continue to add features and capabilities to the app to drive frequency, retention and personalization opportunities, all of which are significantly higher in the app than other digital channels. As it relates to the third implication of the pandemic, one of the ways in which technology is playing a more crucial role in our lives is related to health. For Best Buy Health, our focus on digital health, in particular, helping seniors live more independently with our unique combination of tech and touch has become even more relevant as the world responds to the pandemic and concepts like Telehealth become more mainstream. We continue to expand our assortment of health related products and looking forward, see this as an area of technology innovation we are uniquely well suited to help customers navigate. We recently announced to our employees a new President of Best Buy Health, Deborah DiSanzo, who will start in September. Deborah has more than 30 years of experience at the intersection of health care and tech including leading the IBM Watson Health team, where she launched artificial intelligence offerings designed to help doctors, researchers, health care providers, pharmacists and insurers better serve patients around the world. She's also the former CEO of Philips Healthcare where she helped bring consumer-grade automatic defibrillators to the market. She is a recognized thought leader in artificial intelligence and big data. Has deep experience in running businesses known for their innovation in health care and has a demonstrated ability to drive growth both organically and through acquisitions. We are excited to have her lead our strategic work to bring health technology into the home to help people live better, safer and more independent lives. Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to talk about our ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion in our community. We are always striving to attract and invest in talent that reflects the diversity of all communities and fosters an inclusive culture across the organization. We're powered by the belief that our people matter most and diverse perspectives make us better. Our culture of inclusion values every human beings experience and supports each employee to bring their true and authentic self to work. Our efforts have not gone unnoticed. Earlier this year, the human rights campaign named us a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality. And Forbes Magazine named us on its list of America's Best Employers for Women. We were also recently named one of Parity.org's best companies for women to advance. In the wake of George Floyd's death and the subsequent protest, Best Buy is committed to doing better when it comes to taking action to address racial inequities and injustices. We've created a diverse task force within the company to help us define and create meaningful change and we will provide visibility to our corresponding commitments in the near future. We've also committed to creating more than 100 Teen Tech Centers to help bridge the opportunity gap and the digital divide for teens in disinvested communities across the country. And we're one of the leaders in a new public-private partnership called Connected Minnesota that will provide computers and Internet access to thousands of youth in our home state. Finally, we have signed on as a founding member of the Parity.org ParityPledge in support of people of color. This is a public commitment to interview at least one qualified person of color for every open leadership role that is at the Vice President level or higher, including the in C-suite and Board of Directors.  In conclusion, we delivered very strong Q2 financial results in an environment that continues to evolve. We are executing well and also clearly seeing benefit from the need for people to connect, work, learn, cook and entertain at home. Looking back it was only five months ago that we closed our stores to customer traffic, drew down the full amount of our revolver, made the difficult decision to furlough associates and saw total sales decline reach 30% at one point. Throughout the pandemic, we have been confident that we will emerge an even stronger company than we were before. Clearly, we are still operating in a dynamic environment, and much uncertainty remains around future outbreaks, government stimulus efforts and the economic impact of sustained high unemployment levels and ongoing shutdowns that vary by industry. We are cognizant of all these factors. At the same time, we are encouraged by our clarity of purpose and our momentum, which has guided and will continue to guide our operating model changes and investments. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is more relevant than it has ever been, and we are confident regarding our execution, adaptability and opportunities ahead. We will continue to invest in those capabilities that focus on the customer experience over the long-term and that are designed to provide choice, speed and now safety. Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our Q2 financial results. Matt Bilunas : Good morning. As Corie highlighted, the demand for our product resources was remarkably strong during the quarter. Although, we didn\u2019t provide guidance for the quarter during our last earnings call, we shared a belief that our Q2 sales would be pressured and we would experience a decline in our operating income rate. Ultimately, as we continue to see increased demand for our products, our ability to open almost all of our stores to customer traffic much sooner than we had expected resulted in the stronger-than-anticipated results. And while we are pleased with the financial results and our teams ability to navigate the rapidly changing environment is we also know that our goals reach beyond any one quarter's results and we still face an uncertain environment. An enterprise revenue of $9.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.71, or an increase of 58% versus last year. As a percentage of sales, our non-GAAP operating income of 5.9% increased 190 basis points compared to the prior year. As Corie mentioned, the primary driver of the operating income rate expansion was lower non-GAAP SG&A expense of $290 million, which was 290 basis points of favorable to last year as a percentage of sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales decline a 100 basis points compared to the last year, which partially offset the SG&A favorability. In relation to SG&A, we made several cost decisions in Q1 and as we entered Q2 to alight with the lower sales and sales trend we were seeing expecting to continue at that point. These included keep store employees on furlough to spending short-term incentives and lower advertising expenses. And as we opened our stores, we saw significantly improved sales trends that outpaced our staffing levels for the period of time. These sales on a temporarily lower cost base resulted in incremental leverage that drove a more favorable operating income rate. I would now like to provide some additional details on our Q2 results. In our domestic segment, revenue for the total quarter increased 3.5% to $9.1 billion the increase was driven by a comparable sales growth of 5%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from 25 stores that are permanently closed in the past year as part of our normal course of business. As a reminder, our comparables sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in our curbside only operating model during the period as a result of COVID-19. Domestic online revenue of almost $5 billion, with 53% domestic revenue, which was up from 16% last year, and 42% in Q1 of this year. On a comparable basis, our online revenue increased 242% over the second quarter of last year. Buy online and pick up in store, or curbside was 41% of online sales. I want to note that approximately $5 billion in revenue represents the most online revenue we have ever generated in a single quarter in the company's history, surpassing our previous all time high by almost 40%. From a merchandise perspective, as Corie mentioned, the largest comparable growth categories were computing, appliances and tablets. This growth was partially offset by declines in mobile phones and digital imaging. Home theater comp sales were approximately flat to last year, a material improvement from Q1\u2019s performance as trends continue to improve, as we opened our stores to customer shopping. Additionally, televisions specifically saw a year-over-year comp sales increase. Our gaming category was also approximately flat to last year. While strong demand continued across the category, sales of accessories like controllers and headsets, was offset by constrained inventory availability of gaming consoles. Comparable sales in the services category declined approximately 9% for the decline in services was primarily due to a higher mix of online sales, which has a lower attach rates than in store, within the quarter our sales growth continued to improve as our stores reopened. In our International segment, revenue increased 9.4% to $782 million. The increase was driven by a comparable sales growth of 15.1% which was partially offset by 490 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The growth was primarily driven by Canada, where we experienced similar trends of our domestic segment, from a product category standpoint. And we were able to open almost all locations without appointment, approximately two weeks sooner than, we did in the U.S. Turning now to gross profit, domestic growth profit rate declined 120 basis points to 22.8%. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain cost associated with a higher mix of online revenue. We also saw lower profit share in revenue from our private label and co-branded, credit card arrangement, which impacted our gross profit rate by approximately 20 basis points. Our gross profit rate as a percentage of sales was higher than our expectations going into the quarter, driven by a more favorable promotional environment and a higher mix of sales, from the stores channel. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP decreased $195 million, compared to last year, and as a percentage of revenue, decreased approximately 280 basis points. The largest drivers of the expense decline were, one, lower store payroll expense of approximately $100 million. Two, lower advertising expense of approximately $40 million -- $40 million, three, lower incentive compensation expense of approximately $30 million, related to both, field and corporate employees, and four, lower medical claims expense, of approximately $25 million. Let me share a little additional color, on the lower store payroll expense. The lower store payroll expense represents, a number of components, but the primary driver was fewer labor hours for our associates, the fewer labor hours primary due to stores being closed to non-appointment traffic for approximately half of the quarter in our reduced store operating hours. This decline in labor hours was partially offset by higher hourly wage rates, mainly incremental appreciation pay, for those who are working in our stores, throughout the quarter. Our international SG&A decreased at $24, compared to last year, and as a percentage of revenue, decreased approximately 500 basis points primarily, due to lower store expense in Canada and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. Moving to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $5.3 million in cash. During the quarter, we repaid the full amount of our $1.25 billion credit facility that we had drawn in March. At the end of Q2, our inventory balance was approximately 21%, lower than last year's comparable period, whereas our accounts payable balance increased 31%. And the health of our inventory remains strong. And the lower inventory position reflects the inventory challenges as Corie referenced earlier. During the second quarter, we reached at $143 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we still expect to spend in the range of $650 million to $750 million, during fiscal 2021. Lastly, let me finish by sharing a few comments about the back half of the year. As a result, of the ongoing uncertainty we are not providing financial guidance today. However, I would like to provide some insights, into how we are thinking about Q3 and the rest of the year. Overall, as we plan for the back half of the year, we continue to weigh many factors, including a potential future government stimulus actions, the current shift in personal consumption expenditures from areas like travel and dining out, the possible depth and duration of the pandemic, the risk of continued higher unemployment, and the availability of inventory to match customer demand. With that said, as we enter Q3, there continues to be a heightened demand for the products and services we offer. It is difficult for us to know how sustainable these sales trends are considering the factors I just noted. We are planning for Q3 sales to be higher compared to last year, but likely will not continue at the current level of approximately 20%. We also have plans in place that will allow us to adapt quickly if we needed through the remainder of the year. We anticipate that our Q3 gross profit rate will continue to be pressured compared to last year, as we expect online sales will continue to be a higher percentage of our overall sales mix compared to the prior year. We also expect lower price sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement. As Corie mentioned, we expect our Q3 SG&A dollars to be very similar to last year\u2019s Q3. We expect the combination of our pay evolution changes and the store labor hours we have planned for our current operating model will actually result in slightly lower store expense in Q3. We expect this will be offset by higher advertising expense as we prepare for our earlier start to the holiday season as well as increased variable costs from the anticipated revenue growth. On a sequential basis, we expect the increase in SG&A dollars versus Q2 will primarily be driven by increased store labor hours, reinstatement of short-term extended plans and the increase in advertising expense. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Steve Forbes : Good morning. May be just to start with now you finished there on expenses, as we think back to the Analyst Day last year and the $1 billion cost reduction program, I think you spoke to in the fourth quarter a $160 million of savings against that plan in the back half of last year. Can you update us on where you guys are today because the expectation for flat expenses in the third quarter seems to assume some reinvestment in understanding the variable cost pressure here, but the two-thirds of furloughed associates have returned, just trying to understand, what's driving the lack of flow-through right on the achievement against the cost reduction program? Matt Bilunas : Sure. Yes, from a cost reduction standpoint, clearly we did a number of temporary actions and decisions to navigate through Q1 and Q2. As it\u2019s been our brand for years, we will continue to look for cost efficiencies to help improve our cost basis. We're in a very unique timeframe right now to determine exactly how much is structural or permanent reductions. And so, we will update people as we go through the remainder of the year and into next year. But we do see permanent savings as we move through this time. It's really difficult to determine exactly how much -- I would say as you move from SG&A into Q3, the sequential change, as we talked about, was really looking at increasing store labor hours with the assumption that stores will be open to customer traffic for the whole quarter. And if you look at store labor hours in total, while we are increasing labor hours for them being open and also, we've also increased the hourly wage rate. So with those two included, we still have store labor hours that are slightly lower than last year. So, we do believe we're finding some leverage as we move into Q3. We did say that Q3 sales are actually going to be higher in Q3, exactly how much, we don't know. But with a similar SG&A level in Q3, with higher sales, we would expect SG&A leverage to continue in Q3, exactly how much we'll determine and by how much sales we actually have and how much gross profit rate pressure we'd be able to offset. Steve Forbes : Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, maybe sticking with the margin just on gross. You talked about two pressures, right, in the third quarter, channel mix, right and profit sharing. But you didn't mention promotions or mix. As we think about entering the holiday selling season here, what is sort of the promotional calendar looking like from your perspective today? Corie Barry : Sure. To be clear, in Q2, the primary gross profit rate pressure we saw was coming from supply chain in the form of higher parcel expense. As a reminder, we had 53% of our business done online versus 42% in Q1. So parcel expense is the biggest gross profit rate pressure. And then in addition to that, we continue to see pressure from the lower profit sharing from the city relationship we have. Those are expected to continue into Q3. Promotionally, we actually expected it to be a little bit more promotional going into Q2. It was actually a little less than we actually expected as we work through the quarter. If you look at promotionality into Q3, we would expect that promotionality to be sequentially up from Q1 and Q2, but still not a year-over-year pressure. There are a number of changes to the events and promotions in Q3 that we're obviously working through, but we wouldn't expect to be a year-over-year pressure at this point. Operator : And now I'll move to our next caller. We will hear from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I wondered digging on some of the category trends that you\u2019re seeing in August or July, in August whatever you think is better wins to work it through. What are you seeing and sort of what I would describe -- sort of pulls back-to-school category? Are you seeing home theater and TV up or you're seeing wireless up? What about gaming in advance of the two new platforms? And is -- and to what degree is this still all driven by or largely driven by back-to-school and work from home categories? Corie Barry : Hi, Chris. Thanks for the question. We're seeing favorable trends across literally all of our categories right now as we exit Q2 and start Q3 with the one exception that we noted around mobile phones. But we're seeing trends that are applicable to every part of learning, working, entertaining and cooking from home. And some of that in Corie and Matt's prepared remarks are impacted by the fact we don't have as much inventory as we would like to have right now, but the demand curves that we saw when we opened our stores have continued as we've entered into August well beyond just the traditional back-to-school categories. So I hope that gives you a little bit of color. Chris Horvers : Can you share with us perhaps, like what you're seeing in home theater as an example on a quarter-to-date basis? Mike Mohan : I can't give you the details of quarter-to-date, but we did talk about the improvement in our television performance. I think that's pretty reflective of the -- both the importance of the role we play in the TV or the electronics industry and the importance of stores play because we switched from a negative trajectory in Q1 to a positive trajectory. And our second quarter also includes lapping last year's Prime Day business, where we do a lot of revenue with our own exclusive models with our Amazon Fire TV. So we see the consumer demand strong. We see the demand is strong for larger products and for things that have additional features, higher resolution and clearly, bigger screens as people are spending more time at home. Chris Horvers : Understood. And maybe can you talk about, as my follow-up question, the gross margin mix in I would have thought in the second quarter. You would have seen a pretty solid gross margin mix headwind. Was that essentially fully offset by a lower promotional posture year-over-year? Or was the net of those two things actually positive? Mike Mohan : Yes. We're not going to give specifics. But largely, the product mix that we experienced in Q2 was fundamentally offset by the promotional -- the favorable promotional environment that we saw in Q2. And we would expect the product mix to continue similarly in Q3, assuming computing continues to be a higher mix of our business. And as we said, promotionality will likely be a little bit more in Q3. We'll see how it ends up a little bit more than Q2. And to the extent how much it is favorable. We'll determine how much it offsets the mix impact. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now move to your next question, Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Peter Keith : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Nice execution here. I wanted to look at the margin differential between the retail stores and e-comm. Historically, you've highlighted that e-comm has a lower contribution margin. But now just considering the stronger digital sales going forward, are there efforts to maybe close the gap between those two margins and perhaps bring them in line in future quarters? Mike Mohan : Yeah. In the past, we've talked about the two channels. First, it's really hard to parse out exactly the two different P&Ls between online and store. Overall, on an annual basis, the EBIT levels of both of those channels are actually pretty similar. Now each quarter can be a little bit different. The makeup is a little different, too. Online has typically had a little less, a little lower gross profit rate, a little bit more SG&A leverage. Stores, while carries a little bit more gross profit rate. It carries a little bit more SG&A burden. So they kind of offset each other, and so similar EBIT levels -- or they're pretty similar EBIT level. And when you go through what we saw in Q1, that dramatic change of online sales -- going to online sales, you can't necessarily correct right away in those periods. So, what we've done is made some prudent and necessary steps to kind of look at our SG&A structure. And as we go forward, we'll obviously be looking at how to improve the efficiency of whichever channel we have. I'd say over the years at online, we've actually been improving our gross margin rates. And even over this period of time, we've seen better attach rates during the time. Our store will close in Q1 and Q2. So, we will continue to improve the customer experience to kind of improve the gross margin rates online and continue to look at our cost structure overall for both channels. Peter Keith : Okay. That sounds encouraging. And maybe on a more near-term question, with the commentary about sales growth up 20% in Q3, and you would expect that to moderate certainly, I think that's a good stance to take. Although what I'm asking is, are there identifiable aspects of the sales growth today that you think will go away, whether that's back-to-school or some other category that's abnormally strong right now? Corie Barry : Peter, I'm going to take that one. I think there are a few -- I would characterize them more as unknowns as we look into the back half here. And I would cite things like where we are in the government aid programs and whether or not there will be a new package going forward. Obviously, the stimulus, to some extent has helped certainly up to this point. And it's hard to say how long that kind of hangover effect of that continues. I think there's questions around overall sustained unemployment levels and also school opening and closing decisions and how long those stretch out in the period. And then, of course, we've highlighted inventory availability and what we feel strongly all of our vendor partners are doing everything they can to catch back up. You're talking about holiday levels on manufacturing and fulfillments, and that just is going to take a bit of time to catch trends this tight. And then finally, the actual duration and depths of the virus and how that proceeds through the fall. And so I think it's less about distinctly calling out categories Peter and a little bit more about just the environment that we find ourselves in. Operator : And now we'll take our question from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You noted that your share has largely recovered. Why wouldn't you be gaining share, especially as your stores are now open and you're growing sales 20% quarter-to-date? Corie Barry : So we believe we continue -- we said it in Q1, we lost some share, and we saw that trend continuing in because our stores were largely closed. And we also said, we view that as very temporal in nature. And you're right, we said in the script that we've seen the share recover. There are puts and takes week-to-week, honestly, Michael. There are some where we actually believe we\u2019re gaining. There are others where we think it's a little bit more moderate. Sometimes that can depend on the even inventory position at the time, but overarchingly, we feel pretty strongly that we are in a good share position. And I think our key is that continue to remain incredibly focused on providing the experience that we would expect seamlessly across the channels, still with an emphasis on safety. And we definitely see that in our customer responses. They're very favorably responding to the environment that we're creating. And so I think the team has done a very nice job across however the customer wants to shop meeting their needs. And I think we're very well positioned as we head into Q3 into the back half from a share perspective. Michael Lasser : Including my follow-up is you discussed that SG&A expenses will be similar to last year in the third quarter. You just operated with a new model that showed you can perform pretty well without having to incur as much of a operating expense burden as you had in the past. So what's prompting your view that you need to go back to a full expense rate? Corie Barry : Yeah, I think it's one of the reasons we did the walk of our different models in the script, was -- so everyone understood that we operated the first six weeks on an appointment-only model. And obviously, we saw demand for people wanting to come back into our stores. We opened and we said at that point we brought back about half of our furloughed associates. Honestly, the demand was so high as we opened the stores back up that we were not able to provide the level of service that we would have wanted. And you can see it in things like attach rate of services in the store. You could see it in how heavy the business was at our precincts and how many services people wanted to acquire, we literally didn't have enough people in the stores and hours in the stores to be able to handle that kind of demand. Hence the reason we said that by the end of the quarter we had two-thirds of our furloughed associates back in the hours associated with that so we can meet some of that demand. Now you're going to have a fully normalized quarter, where you're going to have both a new starting wage of $15, but also what we think is the labor commensurate to meet the demand and provides a level of service that will help highlight our ability to provide services or financial services, or lease-to-own or many of the other things that come with a full transaction for us. Michael Lasser : Okay. Thank you very much and good luck. Operator : Now we\u2019ll take a question from Matt McClintock with Raymond James. Matt McClintock : Hi. Yes. Good morning everyone. And congrats to the Best Buy team on good execution. I wanted to ask two questions. The first one is just on supply chain, many fulfillment hubs for the stores that you are shifting to, to this model. Can you talk a little bit about your capacity to shift volume to that method? And then how do you think about the reduction in freight cost and the benefit that you will get as you make this transition? That will be my first question. Thanks. Mike Mohan : Hey, Matt, it's Michael. I'll start with the question. I think about it in two different ways. We were pioneer in this whole idea of buy online and pick up in store, which allowed us to be the first major retailer to figure out how do we ship from store. And based on some of our store size, as we have store that has access capacity, I think you're aware of some of our store conditions. And when we look at what we did for automation over the last three years and the thing that we need to do, it's very easy for us to receive products in our seven RDCs and then put them on a normal truck runs out to the stores that we already do. And if we need to run extra trucks out to these 250 locations, so we can actually have rapid replenishment. And we've been able to use our analytics and algorithms to understand where the density in shipping volumes will come from. It's partially designed to lower expense because you can absolutely have more customers pick up in-store, that's happening at these locations, but it's closer to our carrier delivery pads. It's also basically launching our own same delivery with our Best Buy team members, which is a lower cost than using a third-party service. So there's a mix of all of those choices that we will over time, we believe deliver a lower partial fulfillment expense. But right now, our biggest priority is making sure when you're shopping on Best Buy's digital sites, and we talked about doubling the amount of app downloads, we really want to make sure when you're looking at the item you want, that to get it by data is accurate and it's competitive, and we feel very good about that. And that's the primary thing we focused on for this holiday. Matt McClintock : Thanks for that. And then just my follow-up question is new leadership Best Buy Health. Any strategic changes that you're thinking about that business? Or just any new different direction that you're going to go with, given the various skills that she brings with her? Thanks. Corie Barry : I mean our focus and confidence in the health business remains incredibly strong, and obviously the environment that we find ourselves been only reinforces that strategy. I think Deborah brings just exceptional experience combining technology with healthcare, this idea of tech and touch that we've talked about before, her life experiences in bringing those things together. So I think we found someone who has life experience that very closely aligns with where we think the strategy needs to go. And I wouldn't see the strategic point of view change very much. I just think that we have an ability to continue to accelerate our strategy. Matt McClintock : Thanks for the color. Best of luck. Operator : And Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets will have the next question. Anthony Chukumba : Good morning. Congrats on another spectacular quarter. Also wanted to commend you on all your -- everything you're doing from a social justice perspective. So I have a quick question then a follow-up. You talked a lot about the shift to online. It's --different things we're doing in the store and the 200 stores are going to be hubs for the online, for online deliveries. And I know it's early, but does that make you sort of rethink, how do you think about, what's the right number of stores going forward if you think a lot of this online shift is going to be permanent? Corie Barry : Thank you, Anthony, for the compliments. And let me start by saying, one of the implications we laid out in the script were talking that customer shopping behavior has changed permanently. The customer is in charge. So this isn't about being seamless across channels. It's about being seamless, for the customer. And even at our Investor Day last year, we were talking about, how the customer behavior was changing and accelerating, probably even moving faster, than most retailers were. And so we've been building, with this as the assumption, honestly, we've been improving our digital experiences. We've been building a phenomenal and flexible supply chain, and have employees in stores that are moving at speed with the customers. Most of the capabilities that we've used, you hit on curbside, but also in-store consultations, the cross-training in the stores, we do ship from our stores not just the hubs, the hubs will be used to ship larger quantities. And 60% right now of what we're selling is flowing through our stores in some way, either curbside or in-store pickup or shipped from store. And so, this only underscores our belief that our stores are a unique and powerful asset for us. And I think that, what we will see is that the stores maybe used differently. It's not about left stores, but it might be about more points of presence and a different ability to meet the customer. But we do think one of the unique assets that we have, is our ability to move with speed and frankly put the customer in control, to experience us whatever the way they want. Anthony Chukumba : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just for my follow-up. So, you beat the consensus estimate by a country mile again, this quarter. You repaid your entire revolving credit facility. You're sitting on over $5 billion worth of cash, at what point and I know there is lot of uncertainty out there. we're living it every day in this post-COVID Dystopia, as I do this call from my home office. At what point do you feel like you know where we've got kind of gotten to the other side, we can start to buy back stock again? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. Thanks for the question. We're evaluating, when we may resume stock buybacks. Fundamentally, our allocation strategy has not changed, we first -- we're always going to reinvest at our business, to do what's right for our customers long-term. We still plan to be a premium dividend payer and at some point return all the excess cash to shareholders. I think, ultimately, you nailed that this is a kind of a very uncertain environment, for many reasons, holidays like we look very different, as like many companies where we're taking the time to really evaluate and when we might resume that. But right now, we like the position we're in, to be able to keep flexibility through the remaining part of this year, but we will certainly readdress that at some point. Anthony Chukumba : That\u2019s helpful. Keep up the good work. Operator : And next we'll hear from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : So, the first question I wanted to ask, I think, Corie, you discussed in your prepared comments just the degree to which, new customers come in Best Buy. I think either stores or online is helping to drive the sales recovery. Maybe discussion just a little further the makeup of these customers, where they may be coming from? How different they are done? And the customers that Best Buy catered to in the past? I mean are we seeing now that Best Buy brand is now through this quite as actually reaching a new demographic? Corie Barry : Yeah. Obviously, it's early. So, we're still assessing exactly who all these customers are. I think it's at least clear for us that they are customers for whom we may not have been in the consideration set prior. And like we said in the prepared remarks, clearly, it\u2019s only been five months, but some of those new customers we obtained in March, have shown a much higher propensity to repeat sales, than those new customers we obtained last year during the same period. Nicely, we have also seen our engaged customers start to rebound as we\u2019ve reopened stores. So, it's a little bit the best of both worlds, which is why we're so experientially focused on creating the right environment, both safety and choice that will make us appealing for all customers. So we'll continue to peel apart who those customers are, but honestly our bigger priority right now is not just who they are, it's how do we reengage them, how do we continue to bring them into the Best Buy ecosystem and make them a little bit stickier to the brand, which is why we talk about things like brand love, we talk about things like safety because those become the measures by which the brand is valued over time. Brian Nagel : Got it. It\u2019s helpful. And then my follow-up, this time related to \u2013 you talked as absolute broad base sales during the quarter with the exception as you called out the mobile category. So, my question there is, is that -- you think the weakness in mobile carriers, is the mobile function of maybe a lack of product cycle or just the disruptions to the stores through most of the second quarter or is it something else? Matt Bilunas : Hey, Brian. Yes, I think, you've got actually both of the answers and a part of your question. It\u2019s a one category that is most dependent on our store traffic for the customer experience to make sense. It\u2019s still complicated to do that process online even some of the carrier stores aren\u2019t even open 7 days a week right now. So, we are really focused on the customer experience in advance of new handset launches this fall on 5G. We are still very excited about the category and the experience we create. We did make some enhancements so you can trade in your old connected device portfolio online because we're trying to be cognizant of what the customer is going to need. But it's one area where having our stores closed for a big part of the quarter probably played the biggest impact on the performance we just announced. Brian Nagel : Thank you very much. Operator : Looks like we have time for one final question. We'll hear from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I actually have just two quick follow-up questions to some that have already been asked. We wanted to ask about the acceleration that you're seeing in sales in August. Just what do you think is driving that, given the fact that the stimulus has stated here a little bit. And just wanted to follow-up on the promotional commentary too, about why you don\u2019t necessarily see more pressure in Q3 year-over-year? Does it have to do with still trying to control traffic into the store or the tighter inventory level? Corie Barry : I'll start, Kate, and maybe Matt can follow with some of that promotional commentary. In terms of the strength, and Mike had said it, we are really seeing broad-based strength. Now clearly, there is a work-from-home, learn-from-home component to this. And especially heading into back to school, you\u2019ve got right now, estimates are two-thirds of kids doing at home learning. So that combination of learning at home and a lot of parents working from home and shared devices have to be able to have your own networks and own devices and own webcams. And I mean, there's clearly a lot there. And that will be an extended phenomenon as it's going to have kids going back and forth, probably some school to work. But we're also seeing people want to entertain. We talked a little bit about gaming and the demand there we thought that was a category that was going to be well down this year heading into new launches, and it's been performing. And it's not just about gaming consoles; it's about the computing that\u2019s used for gaming as well, which has been incredibly strong. Mike talked about televisions and entertainment, and this idea back to sports and being able to start to at least watch sports again on devices. I mean everything that people are doing right now is on the back of technology in their home. And it completely underscores our purpose and our philosophy, and that is you actually right now are enriching your life through technology. And we're seeing it across basically every aspect of what we are selling in our stores. Matt Bilunas : Sure. And getting to the promotional question, I think what I said earlier was promotionally, we'll probably be a little higher in Q3 than it was in Q2 and Q1, but fundamentally still not a pressure on a year-over-year basis. In terms of Q3, we would still expect to see a heightened customer demand and just overall, some level of inventory constraints as we work through the quarter. Clearly, as those change it could affect promotionality. But with those two factors involved, I think we still expect to see promotionality a little, not a pressure on a year-over-year basis. Clearly, the promotional cadence and events could change in Q3 and we -- holiday that will probably start early year. But even with those, we believe the demand for the products and services we sell and just also the inventory availability will continue to lend itself to the less promotional environment. Corie Barry : And with that, I want to thank you all for taking the time to join us today, and we look forward to chatting with you next quarter. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 :00 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the Company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting strong Q3 results. Our comparable sales grew a remarkable 23% as we leveraged our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model, and ability to shift quickly to digital, to meet what is clearly elevated demand for products that help customers work, learn, cook, entertain, and connect in their homes. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when, and where they shop with us to ensure it met their definition of safe retailing. The current environment has underscored our purpose to enrich lives through technology, and the capabilities we are flexing and strengthening now will benefit us going forward as we execute our strategy. Our teams showed empathy, ingenuity, and extraordinary execution throughout the quarter. Best Buy has always had a very strong culture. Over the past several years, we have been pairing that strong culture with a purpose-driven approach, and that is showing up in the way we are responding to the current environment. This pandemic as well as the natural disasters and civil unrest of the past several months has been difficult for so many people, physically, financially, and emotionally. I am incredibly proud of the way our teammates are helping not only our customers, but each other and their communities. Customers continue to shop and interact with us differently than pre-pandemic. Online sales increased 174% and comprised 35% of our total domestic sales, which we view as a testament to our strength as a multi-channel retailer. Our interactions with customers via phone and chat were significantly higher than last year, and we continue to evolve our consultation program as our advisors conducted a much higher mix of customer consultations digitally and in stores than last year when consultations were predominantly in customers\u2019 homes. We have seen elevated growth in new customers since the beginning of the pandemic. In Q3, we also saw strong growth in customers we haven\u2019t seen in a while, who have re-engaged with us as well as sales growth from our current engaged customers. As we shared on our last call, sales were up 20% for the first three weeks of the third quarter. Ultimately, as you can see in our results today, our sales growth remained elevated throughout the quarter as we continued to benefit from stay-at-home and the shift in consumer spending away from areas like travel and dining out. In addition, October included the benefit of our Prime Day-related sales, which shifted out of July this year and an earlier start to holiday promotions. From a product category perspective, consistent with last quarter, we saw strong growth across most categories, especially computing and appliances, both large and small. In addition, our home theater category returned to growth and was a significant contributor to our comparable sales increase. We were experiencing supply constraints as we entered the third quarter, and our teams worked closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible. While we did see our inventory positions improve through the quarter, we experienced continued inventory constraints in a number of categories which moderated our sales growth. The high level of global demand simply continued to outstrip supply in a number of categories, particularly large appliances and computing. Our supply chain team was amazing in moving the sheer volume of product into and across the country. In addition, our speed and quality of product delivery in customer homes improved throughout the quarter with October showing our fastest ship-to-home stats since the beginning of the pandemic, despite more than 200% growth in online revenue. From a profitability standpoint, our better-than-expected sales resulted in significant operating income rate expansion and non-GAAP EPS growth of 80% over the same period last year. This strong financial performance is allowing us to share our success with the community, our shareholders, and importantly our employees. In the quarter, we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation to accelerate progress toward our goal to reach 100 Teen Tech Centers across the U.S. And today, we announced we are resuming our share repurchase program. For our employees, during the quarter, we structurally raised our starting wage to $15 per hour, paid discretionary recognition bonuses to field employees, and reinstated our short-term incentive compensation. In addition, in recent weeks, we have resumed our 401(k) employer match and invested significantly in our employee well-being strategy. Some examples include expanding our Caregiver Pay program, so it can now be used to care for in-laws, siblings, and grandchildren, expanding our backup childcare benefit so employees can now use the services of someone they already know and trust and providing tutoring reimbursement for employees\u2019 children. In the early days of the pandemic, we established an employee hardship fund that continues to provide emergency funds to our employees who are sick, have loved ones who are sick, or experiencing financial hardship. As we managed through the pandemic, nothing remains more important to us than the safety of our customers and employees. As you would expect, we follow a variety of safety procedures, including requiring customers and employees to wear face coverings, requiring employees to complete daily wellness checks, frequent cleaning protocols, and more. As has been the case throughout the entire pandemic, we are also limiting the number of customers inside our stores to allow for CDC recommended social distancing. During the third quarter, customers continued to give us high marks for safe interactions as 97% of those surveyed said we made them feel safe while they were in our stores and while we were in their homes. We are constantly adjusting our operations and piloting experiences to emphasize safety and build on our ability to flexibly respond as the course of the virus changes. For example, we recently extended curbside hours to allow customers to pickup their curbside order prior to store open hours or after store close hours. Additionally, in almost all stores, while customers are still welcomed to come in and shop freely, we have transitioned all store pickup orders to curbside pickup orders. This will help reduce the people in our stores who simply need to pickup their order and will allow more customers inside who want to shop or talk to an expert. And for the much anticipated gaming console launch earlier this month, we provided our pre-order customers who had chosen the store pickup option, the ability to schedule a specific time to pickup their product. This resulted in fewer crowds and lines and was hugely successful. Both customers and employees loved it. Despite the disruption and uncertainty related to the pandemic and our current environment, we remain focused on executing Our Building the New Blue strategy. Our current way of life in our homes, reliance on technology has only reinforced our belief in our strategic direction and purpose. Many of the strategic themes we discussed at our investor update last September have come to life in a very accelerated way over the last year. These can be summed up in the following three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead not follow. It is too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as a result of the pandemic, we expect it will be higher than it has been historically. Two, our work force will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers, while providing more flexible opportunities for our people. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people\u2019s lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. Said differently, people are using technology to address their needs in ways they never contemplated before, and we play a vital role in bringing text to life for both customers and our vendor partners. These concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are as quickly as possible both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our business. As you will see, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives in order to chart the very best path forward. In line with our other strategic priorities, we continue to see opportunity for efficiencies, which will allow us to reinvest in the business and build on our experiential differentiation in the future. Now I would like to share some examples of the work we are doing as it relates to our stores and labor model. Starting with stores. Our stores provide customers the opportunity to see and touch product, ask questions, get advice and receive support. As we have discussed many times, they also serve an important role in the fulfillment of online sales. We have created what we believe to be an industry-leading store pickup experience that our customers value and now expect from us. So our stores will look different over time in terms of function, size and possibly even quantity, but they remain incredibly valuable at a cornerstone of our strategy. As we mentioned last quarter, we have started to evolve the way we use our stores for fulfillment. We are pleased with the progress of our 250 ship-from-store hub locations that we first piloted in September. In fact, we are adding about 90 locations for the holiday period. All our stores will continue to ship online orders, but these locations are positioned to ship out significantly more volume and utilize dedicated labor aimed at fulfilling orders originating online. These locations required minimal capital investment as we had the technology in place and were chosen due to their available warehouse space and proximity to carrier partners. Our expectation is that these 340 locations will ship more than 70% of our ship-from-store units during Q4. A significant benefit of our hub model is that it allows us to extend the online order cut-off to 8 p.m. for next day delivery, enabling more speed to customers. We are also testing new store formats to test our hypothesis of stores as more primary fulfillment hubs. In four Minneapolis locations, we reduced the shoppable square footage to approximately 15,000 square feet from an average of 27,000. The product assortment on the sales floor will still include the primary categories these locations had before the remodel, but the merchandised SKU count will be reduced, focusing on the most popular items. The remodels will result in incremental space for staging product for in-store pickup and to support ship-from-store transactions as well as provide the ability to stage inventory for items that may not be on the sales floor. In one of the four locations, we are utilizing some of the available space to increase the previous allocation to our Geek Squad business. Normally, we would not remodel any stores this close to the holiday season, but we feel it\u2019s imperative to move quickly to gain the learnings about how the store format may complement our omni-channel strategy within a particular market. In another store pilot, we are testing the financial return of reorienting the location of the store warehouse to be adjacent to a new covered drive-up curbside experience and lockers. From a labor operating model, we are working to provide our employees opportunities to learn new skills and have more flexibility in their jobs. During the quarter, we continued to advance our flexible workforce initiative, which allow store employees to become certified to perform tasks outside their primary job function. This initiative helps employees develop their careers by giving them an opportunity to learn new skills to broaden their experience. It also gives team members the ability to earn a different hourly wage depending on the tasks performed and the potential for working additional shifts that otherwise may not have been available in their primary job function. This in turn reduces turnover and improve satisfaction. At the start of November, over half of our associates were eligible to flex into different work zones and almost 20% of associates were scheduled in more than one department. For example, an associate who is historically a computing specialist could take a shift in the mobile department either because he or she wanted the change of pace or perhaps we needed extra labor in the department to support a launch or an associate who want additional hours can grab an extra shift making deliveries to customers\u2019 homes. In the near future, employees will also be able to easily take shifts in different store locations. Over time, we believe in place will continue to gain additional skill sets and be able to fulfill multiple roles, which will lead to additional scheduling, eligibility and flexibility for them and also drive efficiencies in labor planning and cost. This initiative works in concert with our focus on evolving the way we position employees to serve customers based on needs irrespective of channel. An example of this is the way we are supporting our customers who want to interact with us by a phone or online chat instead of coming into a store. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen demand for phone and chat interactions skyrocket during the pandemic. We have moved quickly to get about 450 dedicated store associates cross-trained to help customers via phone and chat and are skill setting another 5,000 people to flex into digital sales, if needed based on demand. These 5,000 people could hop online at the stores slow or be utilized in high volume periods during the holiday. We are looking to utilize this staff during Thanksgiving as our stores will be closed this year. In addition to phone and online chat, we have just added the ability for customers to launch a live video chat with one of these store sales associates from the comfort and safety of their own home. As it relates to our customer consultation program, our advisors continue to leverage their flexibility and skill set in meeting customer demand whether that is digitally in our stores or in homes. While the majority of consultations are still in customers\u2019 homes, the number of digital consultations is becoming a meaningful percentage of the mix. As we improve the technology and experience for digital interactions, it opens up the opportunity for our advisors to reach even more customers. Fundamentally, our strategy and competitive advantage depends heavily on our people and a differentiated service we provide our customers. It is true that due to rapidly evolving operating models and escalating demand in the first half of the year, we saw a considerable leverage on lower labor costs. We learned a lot, some which will inform ongoing leverage and efficiencies. We also learned what may not be sustainable for our strategy and the experience we want to provide our customers. We are both implementing change and piloting tests that will define our long-term working model, balancing our customer experience expectations and efficiencies. As you can see, we have been examining our business model from top to bottom to determine where we maybe able to accelerate our strategic efforts. We have also reviewed areas where we might scale back. Importantly, we viewed it as critical that the outcome of this analysis would ensure our focus and resources are closely aligned with the opportunities we see in front of us. As a result, during the quarter, we made the difficult decision to exit our operations in Mexico. I want to thank the teams in Mexico for their tremendous work over the past several years. They should all be incredibly proud of their accomplishments. Now let\u2019s talk about holiday. 2020 has truly been a year unlike any other, and that\u2019s certainly true for this year\u2019s holiday shopping season. First, we launched our Black Friday deals earlier than ever in mid-October and have had several other sales events since that time. We started these events early and spread them over the course of several weeks to help avoid overly crowded days in our stores in order to create a safer shopping experience. We also decided to close our stores on Thanksgiving Day. In addition to our existing in-store safety measures, we have added a digital queue for customers who are waiting for assistance from an employee so they can socially distance outside in their cars or within the store while they wait. And we now have a dedicated customer experience host at every store to help guide shoppers, answer questions and manage any lines. We have also extended our store hours to close at 8 :00 p.m. from 6 :00 p.m. And similar to prior years, we\u2019ll add additional hours as we move through the holiday season. Meanwhile, customers who shop online now have more choices for how to get their order. Contactless curbside pickup is available at all of our stores. Online customers using our app to pickup their orders can plan their trip by viewing high and low traffic times. With first time launches of our app up 40% in Q3 compared to last year, customers are using the app more than ever and it is increasingly becoming a great self-help tool in addition to a compelling shopping experience. Of course, our online customers can also choose next day or same-day delivery. In addition to our diverse network of third party partners, we expect to have about 450 stores set-up with dedicated labor and vehicles so that our own Best Buy employees can make deliveries to our customers. Almost all Best Buy stores now offer same-day delivery on thousands of products. If the customer places an order by 1 :00 p.m. local time, they\u2019ll get it by 9 :00 p.m. Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to update you on our ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity in our community. As we have discussed before, we are committed to doing all that we can to further economic and social justice in our communities. This effort takes form in several ways, including our signature Teen Tech Centers. Currently, we have more than 30 of these locations, each of which typically operates year round in service of hundreds of teens helping them learn the technology skills necessary to be successful in the modern economy. The data on this effort is clear. We are making a measurable difference in the lives of teens who might not otherwise have this chance. By the end of 2025, we will have more than 100 of these Teen Tech Centers, serving more than 30,000 teens a year. In a related effort, we are also dedicating sizable resources to scholarships with historically black colleges and universities around the country that will of course be available to our Teen Tech Center graduates. At the same time, we are looking to do more closer to home, and are proud to announce that going forward, we plan to have one out of three non-hourly open corporate positions filled by someone who is black, indigenous or a person of color. In the field, we also plan to have one out of three non-hourly open roles filled by women. At the same time, our intention is to create over the next few years\u2019 parity and retention rates among all of these groups. In support of these initiatives, we have transferred $40 million in Q3 to the Best Buy Foundation. The senior leadership team and I are proud of the work our company has done on these initiatives, and are pleased we could increase funding on this one-time basis in support of our efforts. Earlier this month, we helped empower our employees to vote by opening our stores at noon local time on election day to ensure our store employees had the time they needed to cast a ballot in person if they chose to do so. We also gave paid time off to employees who volunteered to work at the polls on election day. We also remain committed to our broader environmental, social and corporate governance efforts, including those related to sustainability. To that end, we recently signed the Climate Pledge, a commitment to be carbon-neutral across our business by 2040, a decade faster than our previous goal of 2050. This commitment is supported by the recent completion of our second solar field investment. In conclusion, we delivered very strong Q3 financial results. We are executing well and clearly benefiting from the need for people to connect, work, learn, cook and entertain at home. Throughout the pandemic, we have been confident that we will emerge an even stronger company than we were before. In the near-term, of course, much uncertainty still remains around the depth and duration of the pandemic as well as economic impacts of sustained high unemployment rates. We continue to be encouraged by our clarity of purpose and our momentum, which has guided and will continue to guide our operating model changes and investments. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is more relevant than it has ever been. And we are confident regarding our execution, adaptability and the opportunities ahead. In many ways, our response to the impacts of the pandemic has allowed us to accelerate our strategy. And there remain many aspects of the strategy that require investment to remain relevant with customers in this very competitive omni-channel environment, such as our digital experience, supply chain, and critically important in-store and in-home associates. In fact, having the foresight to invest in these omni-channel experiences for the past several years was essential in delivering our results during this pandemic. We will continue to invest in those capabilities that focus on the customer experience over the long-term and that are designed to provide choice, speed and now safety. Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our Q3 financial results. Matthew Bilunas : Good morning. The demand for our products and services has remained incredibly strong for the past several months, and our Q3 sales were better than our expectations. As Corie highlighted, technology has taken on an increased importance in all of our lives. And while we are clearly seeing sales growth from consumers looking for ways to navigate through the pandemic, the fundamental reliance on technology has also grown and strengthened our purpose. On enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.06 or an increase of 82% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.1% increased 190 basis points as we saw leverage from the higher sales volume on our fixed expenses. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the total quarter increased 21% to $10.9 billion. The increase was driven by comparable sales growth of 23%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year as part of our normal course of business. As Corie mentioned, October included the benefit of our Prime Day-related sales, which shifted out of July this year and an earlier start to holiday promotions. This helped push October comp sales up to 33%, our highest monthly comparable sales growth of the quarter. From a merchandising perspective, we saw broad-based strength across most of our categories with the largest comparable growth coming from computing, home theater and appliances. This growth was partially offset by decline in the mobile phone category. In addition, comparable sales in our services category grew 13% during the third quarter. Similar to the broad-based strength in our product categories, our services category had positive revenue growth from both Total Tech Support and our Warranty business. In our International segment, revenue increased 25% to $1 billion. The increase was driven by a comparable sales growth of 27%, which was partially offset by 140 basis points of negative foreign currency impact. The growth was primarily driven by Canada where we experienced similar trends as our Domestic segment from a consumer demand standpoint. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate declined 30 basis points to 24%. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with higher mix of online revenue. As Corie noted, our online sales were 35% of our overall domestic sales in the quarter, which compared to 16% last year. We also saw lower profit sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. These pressures were partially offset by a promotional environment that was more favorable compared to both last year and our expectations going into the quarter. Our international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 10 basis points to 22.6%, primarily due to a less promotional environment, partially offset by increased supply chain costs from a higher mix of online sales. Moving to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $146 million compared to last year, and as a percentage of revenue, decreased 210 basis points. On our last call, we shared our expectation that SG&A dollars in Q3 would be similar to the prior year. The largest drivers of expense increase versus last year were also the areas that were higher than our expectations at the start of the quarter. These were; one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $75 million; two, increased variable cost associated with the higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees; and three, the $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower store payroll expense. Let me share a little additional color on the lower store payroll expense, which was driven by a fewer labor hours for our associates. This was primarily due to lower store revenue, our reduced store operating hours and efficiencies in our labor model, which were partially offset by additional hours needed to support the fulfillment of online orders. This decline in labor hours was partially offset by higher hourly wage rates as the increase in our starting wage to $15 an hour went into effect at the start of Q3. I would point out that although our Q3 store channel revenue was down approximately 8% to last year, when including the online revenue for store and curbside pickup and ship-from-store, the revenue supported by our stores labor actually increased on a year-over-year basis. On our last earnings call, we shared that about two-thirds of our original 51,000 furloughed employees had returned to work. Any remaining employees that had been on furlough were asked to return to work as seasonal employees for the holidays. Let me next provide more context on the restructuring charges from this quarter. As Corie mentioned, we made the decision during the quarter to close down operations in Mexico. In our Domestic segment, we also took actions to more broadly align our corporate organizational structure in support of our strategy. As a result of these decisions, we incurred approximately $111 million in restructuring charges and an additional $36 million of inventory markdowns in Mexico that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. For context on our Mexico business, its fiscal 2020 annual revenue was approximately $400 million with slightly negative operating income. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.7 billion in cash and short-term investments. In the third quarter, we completed a public bond offering for $650 million in 1.95% notes due in October 2030. The net proceeds from the sales will be used to replace the $650 million in 5.5% notes that mature in March 2021, which we expect to retire during Q4 by exercising to park off. At the end of Q3, our inventory balance was approximately 1.5% lower than last year\u2019s comparable period, whereas our accounts payable balance increased 26%. We ended the quarter with inventory down 21% to last year. And although trends progressively improved throughout the quarter, as Corie stated, we still experienced constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We will first reinvest in the business to drive growth and remain committed to being a premium dividend payer. We will then look to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases. During the third quarter, we paid $142 million in dividends. We suspended share repurchases last March in order to conserve liquidity in light of the COVID-related uncertainties, but we now plan to resume share repurchase this month. We anticipate the level of share repurchases in Q4 to be similar to last year\u2019s comparable quarter. As we look to next year, assuming business trends remained favorable, we would expect to spend a higher amount on share repurchases than we have in more recent fiscal years. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we now expect to spend approximately $725 million during fiscal 2021. Lastly, let me finish by sharing a few comments about the fourth quarter. As a result of the ongoing uncertainty, we are not providing financial guidance today. However, I would like to provide some insight into how we are thinking about Q4. As we start the fourth quarter, the demand for the products and services we sell remains at elevated levels. But similar to last quarter, it continues to be difficult for us to predict how sustainable these trends will be. In fact, we are seeing COVID cases surge throughout the U.S. and Canada at the time of significant holiday volume through our stores, online and supply chain. There continue to be other factors to consider, such as potential future government stimulus actions, the current shift in personal consumption expenditures from areas like travel and dining out, the risk of continued higher unemployment and the availability of inventory to match customer demand. From a revenue standpoint, we believe our Q4 sales growth will be positive, but we don\u2019t expect sales trends to remain at the levels we experienced during Q3. While our sales in the first few weeks of November have remained strong, they include the launch of the new gaming consoles from Sony and Microsoft, and also likely a pull forward of sales from later in the holiday season. In addition, inventory constraints are expected to continue in certain key categories. We anticipate that our Q4 gross profit rate will continue to be pressured, and we expect the year-over-year rate decline in Q4 to be higher than it was in Q3. This is due to an expectation that a higher mix of online sales will continue to drive higher supply chain costs, including the increased parcel surcharges from our carrier partners. In addition, we anticipate a higher sales mix from lower margin gaming consoles to negatively impact our rate. As it relates to the promotional environment, while we expect to see continued favorability on a year-over-year basis, we expect it to be less of a tailwind than it has been in the first three quarters of this year. We expect our Q4 SG&A dollars versus the prior year to increase as a percentage in the mid to high single-digit range. The increase in SG&A is expected to be driven by incentive compensation, increased variable costs from the higher expected sales and investments in both our health business and in technology. We expect these increases to be partially offset by slightly lower store payroll expense. I will now turn the call over to operator for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. Wanted to just follow-up on your last comments there. I think in 2Q, you had commented that the second half would potentially benefit from a lower or less promotional environment on the gross margin front. So wondering if you could talk a little bit about that as you look to 4Q given the comments you just made on the gross margin. And then also, wondering if you could just give very high-level puts and takes as we look to 2021, because obviously there\u2019s so many moving parts on both the gross margin and the SG&A side. So if you could just give high-level comments on how we should think about both of those into 2021 that would be helpful? Matthew Bilunas : Sure. So for promotions, Q3 was definitely less promotional than last year, but a little bit more than we saw earlier in the year due in part to the early start to the holiday, which occurred in October. Due to the continued demand for products and industry-wide inventory strains, we're still seeing promotionality be less on a year-over-year basis. Our assumption would be that in Q4 promotionality increases a bit relative to Q3, but considering the elevated level of demand and continued constraints in some areas of inventory, we don't expect it to be a year-over-year pressure. So looking into next year from a cost perspective, from a margin and SG&A, I think it's a bit early to know exactly how that manifests next year. We're clearly going to be looking at next year quarter-by-quarter, every quarter this year was a bit different than the others. And so as we enter next year, it's likely that the trends that we're seeing continue on from a demand perspective, at least on the start. And so, we'll look at the early part of the year a little differently probably than the rest. And we'll obviously remain competitive from a pricing perspective throughout the year, but we'll also look to leverage the efficiencies and the learnings we've made this year in terms of the SG&A structure. Karen Short : Great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My question, I'll make it in two parts. Maybe first for Corie, thinking about the margin structure of the business over the medium-term. I think you outlined all of those steps you're taking and the experimentation with the stores and the different labor models. I'm wondering you're doing that because you think the margin of the business could end up north of that non-GAAP goal of 5% or are these changes in order to uphold it? And then just the second question is, I think Matt mentioned, look, we still expect comp store sales to be positive for the fourth quarter. I think a lot of us expect that. But given some of the pull forward that you're seeing today, is there any reason we should see a sharp slowdown and do you have a sense of how much that pull forward is affecting the business given how early some of the Black Friday sales have started? Thanks. Corie Barry : Good morning, Simeon. As we go back to the update that we provided last year, you could hear it in the remarks, we feel like the strategy is spot-on, and in fact more relevant than ever. And obviously, the proliferation of consumer electronics is as high as it's ever been. People are just getting more comfortable using connected devices and living a connected life, frankly, across their home. Obviously, you can appreciate we're not going to update the financial targets. I think what we would say is, in the many ways we're ahead of where we thought we would be at this time, we\u2019ve accelerated a massive amount of learnings and investments. And I think you'd also argue many retailers are ahead of where they thought they'd be at this time. I think right now we believe that's all the more reason we need to double down on what makes us unique. Therefore, we're testing, we're learning, and then probably have some suite of investing to do once we understand better the results of those tests and those hypotheses. What's most important, what remains most important is building those fundamentally sound relationships with our customers that keeps us relevant in their consideration set over time. And so, we will continue to make investments around technology, stores, membership. Could we see an EBIT rate higher than the 5% we laid out? Maybe, but that's not the goal. The goal right now is to figure out how customers are shopping differently; and therefore, the role we need to play to build those foundationally sound relationships over time. Matthew Bilunas : And maybe from Q3, a pull forward question that you had, I think, clearly, we outlined October sales benefited from earlier start to the holiday season. It also benefited from a shift of Prime Day from July into October. It's really difficult to predict exactly how much was pulled into Q3 from Q4, but there are a few considerations, and we talked about October being 33% growth in the month. We also talked about the start of the quarter was about 20% growth in the first few weeks. So, clearly with the elevated level of demand in October, it clearly points to a period in between those two that is around 20% or slightly lower, so that's why when we look at Q4, we don't necessarily expect the trend of Q4 to continue on at that Q3 pace. Although, we wouldn't necessarily say we're signaling sharp declines, we're just very thoughtful about the rest of the quarter coming and that we're pulling sales further into October and in November, and we have some pretty significant days ahead in terms of Thanksgiving Day being closed, but also Cyber week and the week before Christmas. So, just a lot of factors still there to think through. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thank you both. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Thomas with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Bradley Thomas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Great results. Question on inventory. Could you just talk a little bit more about where you're seeing shortages? Maybe how much do you think that hurt you in 3Q and how much it might hurt you in 4Q? And when do you think the supply chain may start to catch up with the strong demand? Thank you. Matthew Bilunas : Hey Brad. Thanks for the question. As we announced in our prepared remarks, we started the quarter with the inventory down pretty significantly versus prior year a least matched against our sales trends. And the team and I just need to call it out, did remarkable work. We see more merchandise in our fiscal third quarter I think in the history of Best Buy, which is a feat in itself. The pressures are still in the long lead time categories. Domestically, major appliances saw impacts both on inconsistent demand and then factories shutting down for COVID-related issues. And clearly, there's consumer demand with the housing market that we see as a long tail play. We're excited about being back into the inventory position we need, but we think it's going to remain constrained probably into early next year. The demand in computing has been sustained right since the start of the COVID crisis. And right in the middle of the crisis, we had a back-to-school event. Normally you guys would be asking questions about our back-to-school season. It's been back-to-school or back to work-at-home or back to educating-at-home since March. We're really happy with the supply chain model there. We have great relationships with all of the world's top OEMs and we work with them literally everyday to fulfill the needs, but I think we're going to be \u2013 we'll be tighter there than we would appreciate, but it will be enough inventory to support our sales. As we transitioned into next year, I don't see any long tail things. There's some real constraints, obviously, part of this what I was saying on the new gaming consoles, and that will probably be sustained through the holiday season. But there are long product cycle, and I see us getting in a good position fairly quickly after the holiday. Thanks for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Hi, thanks. My question was about the one area that was down in the quarter, mobile phones. Just curious if that is simply a function of the delay of the iPhone versus a year-ago or is there something else there in terms of replacement cycles that you're seeing in consumer demand? Matthew Bilunas : Hey Greg. Thanks for that question. I think you kind of hit it on the head. There has been a year-over-year change on when new products were launched versus when they were in 2019. That's probably the biggest transition that you have to think about. What we're excited about is on the new devices, the demand for the higher capacity, larger screen and the phones that are purely ready to be 5G enabled are quite good. And the vast majority of the products we are selling are actually 5G enabled. So we like the demand signals going into what the new devices will look like. I think the replacement cycle on phones has been forever changed. And so the role we will play will continually help customers who are seeking out the newest technology to get the best out of their experience. And that's what we're excited about going forward. Greg Melich : And then a follow-up to the same question is on services. How many new customers did you get in Total Tech Services and Home Advisor? You mentioned you had more. So if you could give us a number, that would be great. Corie Barry : Yes. For Total Tech Support, we did grow the member count after holding pretty steady in the first half of the year. We haven't been updating that number quarterly and we're not going to now. But for reference, the last we shared was about 2.3 million members at the end of fiscal 2020. We definitely saw usage of the remote support offering continue to increase during the pandemic. And we also saw improved trends compared to earlier in the year as it relates to things like installation and repair. And we expect that usage to continue to ramp up as the stores are fully open and we're back in homes providing the more fulsome suite of services. To underscore what Mike said, I'd like to give our teams a ton of credit for the work that they have done to creatively find ways to help our customers, who in some cases are pretty desperate to make sure their devices are working together. Greg Melich : That's great. Great job, and have a happy Thanksgiving holidays everyone. Matthew Bilunas : Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. You too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Wanted to ask about kind of the changes to the operating model, just in terms of shrinking your physical space and some of the shifts you've made to the labor model. And I guess what I'm wondering is, has the shift resulted in lower sales so lower market share, but higher returns and profitability? Is that a win or is that go-forward strategy or do you have to win on both of those fronts? Thanks. Corie Barry : Yes. Thanks for the question, Scot. The point of \u2013 so there is kind of two different subjects here. One is a very small test that we're doing right now, four stores are on square footage. And it's more about stores as a real fulfillment hub that can act as a convenient and easy place for our customers to come and get what they want, and both a more limited SKU assortment that is merchandised, but frankly a wide assortment that's available for pickup in the store as well as some services. That's really early, it's small and we're learning. On what we're trying to achieve with our operating model changes, it's interesting. What we're actually trying to achieve is a better customer experience at the end of the day that is enabled through a more flexible and more educated workforce. And the idea in that \u2013 the win is actually that we can provide more flexible expertise across the store that you might have one teammate who can work with you across the entire store that we developed the best-in-class curbside and in-store pickup capabilities. But the concept is not about pull out as much cost as possible. The concept is about creating a workforce that is more flexible and can be used across departments and frankly across customer needs. So it's not quite funky moving around in the store. Success then is actually you have a more fulsome in-store experience and your associates have the ability to garner more skills to opt into more flexible schedules and to be able to potentially at some point even move new between stores depending on their availability. Scot Ciccarelli : So we would characterize it as more qualitative rather than quantitative in terms of the scorecard? Corie Barry : I think it's both, honestly, Scot. So I mean, Matt hit on in his prepared remarks, there are some efficiencies that you're able to build in, in terms of hours, but again, that's not the goal in and of itself. The goal is to provide more seamless customer experiences, better employee experiences that actually then continue to create that relationship over time, which also is a quantitative measure. It's just that it's more of a quantitative measure over time. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Thanks. Have a great holiday. Corie Barry : Thanks. You too. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. Michael Baker : Hi. Thanks. So a product related question, but two parts, if I could. First, an update on your healthcare initiative, which really hasn't come up too much in this call. Can you talk about products in the GreatCall business, then also, where you are on the commercial side of that as the pandemic slow down discussions with insurance companies? And then the second product question is on gaming. So you said consoles, there is some concerns that that was strong in October and will that continue \u2013 excuse the dog in the background. My question is will that continue into the fourth quarter as well? Another question gaming consoles also be very strong in the fourth quarter. And so why would that slow down? Thanks. Corie Barry : Absolutely. I'll start with some color around the health business. I think it's obvious, but it bears repeating what we're living through right now with the pandemic completely underscores our strategy and what we're trying to do, and that is to help seniors live more independently with the help of technology. I think we do that through this unique combination of technology and touch and our ability to both have the right products, to your point, but also have the services wrapper cycle around it. The consumer business was impacted earlier in the pandemic with the closure of the stores. Obviously, we sell a lot of those devices through the stores where you have a chance to really interact with the customer and explain the unique capabilities of those products. Obviously, as we've opened the stores more broadly, those trends have improved materially and we're definitely seeing that kind of GreatCall consumer side of the business ramp up. There is also just a question of broader health and fitness kind of writ large. And again, you probably know it from your own life, there are more people using technology devices whether it's at home fitness, whether it's monitoring and tracking your own fitness, there are more people using those devices. So we continue to like our positioning in the kind of broader health and fitness arena beyond just the kind of aging side of things. And then obviously, we continue to work on our relationships on the commercial side of the business where we work directly with the payers and providers. There continues to be significant interest. But you can imagine, there's a lot going on that side of the business just given the pandemic that we're working through, but the adoption of things like telehealth, the ability and frankly pull from consumers to use more tools like that only underscores the potential in that market we believe from here. Mike, maybe you want to comment on gaming? Michael Mohan : Yes, certainly. Mike, good question on gaming. I think maybe just some clarification. In Q3, we didn't call it out specifically that the gaming category high growth was driven from legacy devices, primarily products from Nintendo, peripherals and accessories. As we moved into Q4, the two new console launches from Microsoft and Sony are off to a great start and they reflected in the comments that Matt had at the start of the quarter. I think the only thing I'm giving perspective on is, there are going to be constrained through the quarter. And there will be more demand than there will be devices, which has been sort of a reoccurring occurrence every six or seven years. This year it's more heightened because more people I think than ever need something to do with their families at home. What we're excited about is the customer experience, steps we took to create the best experience on something constrained. These are two world-class partners, but bless their hearts, they didn't do us any favors the way they launched products. And so when we had pre-order demand, we set up everything from how you queue for it, how you booked an appointment so you wouldn't wait in line when you got your products. And as we get additional inventory during the holiday season, we were at least seeking of the way that you can find it on bestbuy.com and our digital channels and you can actually get it as a customer. We're trying to protect the experience so people who are trying to buy it and resell it or bought, I can't get through our site as easily as perhaps other places. It's a lot of work our technology and customer experience and operations teams are doing, but our goal is to get as many of these products into consumers' hands to delight them. What we can't tell you is how many we'll sell, because I actually don't know how many we're going to get, and that's probably indicative of everybody else you guys cover. I think the long-tail on this is going be pretty strong given the fact people want these devices at home and the early signs on people who are buying from Best Buy are new customers to us, slightly younger and we're excited about their ability to come back and visit us for peripherals and accessories. Hope that helps, Mike? Michael Baker : That does. Thank you. I appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is around the store model test that you're doing first in Minneapolis and then secondly with piloted the warehouse adjacent or the drive-up. Can you give us some color as to the timing associated with measuring the ROI on that and the potential for rolling that out in 2021 to a broader group of stores? Corie Barry : I think we're going to need to give this one a little bit of time, obviously. And we said in the remarks, this is about a market working together to serve customers in the most effective way possible. And so this is the very first foray into fulfillment stores like this. And my guess \u2013 not my guess, I know. We will continue to try additional formats and additional ways that we will approach the market as we head into next year. And so we'll keep you apprised as we learn more, but we definitely want to give this one enough time, especially in a pandemic world where operations are different than what steady state might look like over time. So we are urgent with it, but at the same time, we want to make sure we give it enough time so that we capture as many learnings as possible in this real market-tailored approach. Seth Basham : Got it. Just to clarify, enough time, is that a six or 12-month type timeframe that you're measuring or even longer? Corie Barry : I don't see it being something that looks like three years, certainly. And I think a little bit of this depends on how the business normalizes back through the pandemic, through some of the economic implications. So it's not just about the timeline we set, it's also about making sure that we feel like we're getting accurate and real results for where the business is going to go from here. Seth Basham : I appreciate it. Thank you. Corie Barry : No problem. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle : Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe just following up on Mike's question on gaming and just kind of how to think about what that business looks like for the rest of the quarter. Clearly, demand for these new consoles is out to control, good, although I think basically sold out at this point. So I guess with those consoles at least in kind of very limited stocks, do you think that suppresses demand or do you think that just booked as a category that people are obviously living into now and will remain maybe a hot gifting category and things remain good. How do you think about that going through the rest of 4Q? Michael Mohan : Hey, Curt. I'll start. I think it's a good question and it's not an easy one to give you an answer on other than the category itself and the desire for people to entertain their families and themselves with gaming type solutions is extremely strong, and that's applicable to things that are constrained like the new consoles from Sony and Microsoft. But we're still seeing incredibly strong demand for all the legacy products that you could argue have been in the market for a year and a half to two years. And what I think you're going to see is, as allocations continue to improve, we've always focused on the customer experience and execution of making sure those who need these devices get them as fast as possible that you could turns into the ability for us to get more products sooner, but this is one of those items that are hard to predict. I don't think you're going to see this pull any drag on demand. I think it will be the highest demand item for this holiday and we're going to work our best to get our unfair share of allocation to take care of as many customers as possible. Corie, would you add anything else to this? Corie Barry : No, that was perfect. Curtis Nagle : Okay. And then maybe just one other quick one. One other quick category question. Just thinking about health and exercise equipment, it's something I think you guys have focused on a little bit more this year for obvious reasons. How they're performing? How do you think that category looks through the holiday and next year? Is that an area of I guess continued expansion? Michael Mohan : That is another great question. We're excited about the category. We talked about it a couple of quarters ago, rolling out some products to our stores as the pandemic had started. As we think about the ability to communicate to consumers in this digital first world, we're more excited right now about expanding the assortment and working on logistics of getting some of these bigger products into people's homes, helping them get set up, in some cases getting stuff out of their homes. That's one of the big paying points people are seeing. I think we've got some excitement in this space, not just for this quarter, but as it moves forward into next year. And I think it's applicable to all these other kind of consumer connected health products that we might think of them as simply as a watch or the Fitbit that you're wearing today. But as you start to put them in concert with other devices that help you live a healthier lifestyle, we're working really hard to help show customers the various options and solutions you can get with a complete suite of things to help with your fitness and wellness needs. So we're very excited about the category. Curtis Nagle : Okay. Thanks, and good luck for the holiday. Michael Mohan : Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : Hey, guys. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. So I was just wondering if you could talk about how you guys are thinking about next year as you're trying to comp this comp? What you can do to make it easier to go over? Matthew Bilunas : Sure. I'll start and Corie or Mike can jump in. I think overarching Corie kind of said this a little earlier, I think it's far too early for us to really comment on sales next year. Right now we're very, very focused on helping our customers meet their demand right now with the premium on safety for both them and our employees. So that's our first objective right now. I think there's still going to be a lot of factors for us to weigh as we move into the beginning of next year. Certainly, there is a continuation of elevated demand for things to work and learn and cook and entertain for home. And it's likely that some of that continues on as we go into the beginning of next year, but may start to subside a bit. There is still a heightened level of unemployment right now and likely to continue into next year as well. And clearly, we're not totally sure on how the vaccine starts to get distributed out to everyone. So there's a lot of factors that we're continuing to weigh in, which is primarily to \u2013 as well we have a whole holiday quarter ahead of us. And so we've got to see how that shakes out in addition to that. So I think what we can see, like I said earlier, is I think these elevated trends will likely continue a bit as we go into next year, but we'll likely have to take each quarter individually and look at the demand trends that we saw this year and try to understand what they look like next year. I think fundamentally, we are seeing that role of technology only intensifying people's lives, we've said this before. I think it's really proliferated \u2013 we've proliferated devices in people's homes and those devices need to continue to be supported. Those devices needed additional advancement and innovation as we go forward. And so we see a lot of opportunities ahead of us. Each quarter will present its own unique challenges and we'll work through that and we'll give more update on next year as we get towards the end of the year. Scott Mushkin : And kind of along that lines, how are you thinking about the inflation, both from a product perspective, but also from a wage perspective? And I'll yield. Thank you. Matthew Bilunas : Sure. Maybe starting with the wage perspective, this year, we clearly went to move to $15 an hour with our sales within our stores. And so we'll continue to approach increases based on our processes as we go forward. So we've taken a fairly large step forward this year in terms of setting our minimum wage to $15 an hour. So from a wage perspective, we feel like we're very competitive with the wage and all the other benefits that we offer our associates. From a macro perspective, a little early to know exactly how inflation takes hold next year. There is always some level that we're factoring in, but overarchingly, it's not something that we are too worried about at this point. Corie Barry : I think structurally what the team has done an excellent job with is investing in our employees and then finding ways for us to meet the customer needs in the most flexible way possible. I think about this kind of like as efficiencies that are in service of the customer. So whatever the inflation kind of environment looks like, what we're focused on is making sure we find the balance between what we need to do for our people and how we can best operate the business. Corie Barry : And so with that, I'm going to end where we started. I want to thank all of our customers, our employees for the amazing work that they've been doing and the effort that they put forth through really incredibly different and challenging times. And thank you to all of you for joining us today. We hope you have a safe and happy holiday. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 :00 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; Matt Bilunas, our CFO; and Mike Mohan, our President and COO.

The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During the fourth quarter, our teams across the company delivered an exceptional customer experience in a safe environment. They showed amazing flexibility and execution, managing extraordinary volume in a dynamic situation, and they strive every day to create safe shopping experience often in the face of pandemic fatigue. As a result, today we\u2019re reporting strong Q4 financial results which include comparable sales growth of 12.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 20%. We continue to leverage our unique capabilities, including our supply chain expertise, flexible store operating model and ability to shift quickly to digital to meet the ongoing elevated demand for stay-at-home products and services. Online sales grew almost 90% to a record $6.7 billion and made up 43% of our total domestic sales. Our stores played a pivotal role in the fulfillment of these sales, as almost two thirds of our online revenue was either picked up in-store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 48%, representing a 90% increase in volume. Ship-to-home volume was up 38% and even with that increase in volume, we were able to accelerate the delivery speed to our customers on a year-over-year basis by strategically using our partners, our stores and our employee delivery. For additional context, same-day shipping volume was up 376% and our employees delivered more than 1 million units. From a product category perspective, the biggest contributors to the strong comp sales growth in the quarter were computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theatre. As you recall, this year we started holiday promotions in October, which is in our third quarter. We started these events early and spread them over the course of several weeks to help avoid overly crowded days in our stores in order to create a safer shopping experience. These efforts to manage the traffic flow into our stores proved effective and evened out some of the peaks and valleys through the holiday season. As planned, it also resulted in some holiday sales being pulled into Q3 after reaching 33% comp growth in October, our growth rate moderated as we lapped last year's November and December holiday sales before accelerating again in January due to the ongoing elevated stay-at-home demand boosted by government stimulus actions. That sales growth momentum we saw in January has largely continued into February. As a result of both the successful early holiday sales and the product availability issue the industry has been seeing all year, we continue to experience product availability constraints during the fourth quarter, which we believe moderated our holiday sales, particularly in large appliances, computing and televisions. In addition, demand for the new gaming consoles far outstripped supply across the industry as is well documented. Our teams work closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible, and inventory positions improved through the quarter. As I step back and reflect upon the whole year, it was truly a year like no other. In addition to an international pandemic, there was social unrest across the nation and numerous natural disasters. I am proud of and inspired by the way our teams have navigated the challenges and what they have accomplished. We saw remarkable customer demand and delivered outstanding execution that led to a very strong financial result. For the year, we delivered comparable sales growth of 9.7% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 30%. We drove record free cash flow of $4.2 billion and ended the year with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have responded to the impacts of it with a focus on safety and helping customers get the products they need to work, learn, cook, entertain and communicate at home. We provided customers with multiple options for how, when and where they shopped with us to ensure we met their definition of safe retailing, and customers noticed. The percent of customers surveyed who said we made them feel safe while they were in our stores and while we were in their homes was consistently above 97% throughout the year. To best serve our customers during the pandemic, we had to be innovative and flexible. Early in the year, we quickly rolled out enhanced curbside pickup across our stores to provide our customers convenience when we made the difficult decision to close our stores in March. In May, we developed an in-store appointment model that provided our customers with an option to shop in our stores as we prepared to open stores back up to customer shopping. We developed solutions like virtual consultations with advisors and video chats with our store associates. In addition, we made significant improvements to the functionality and customer experience of our app to provide access to shopping support and fulfillment. This drove not only new users of the app, but also increased levels of customer engagement with the app. In Q4, first time launches of the app were up almost 80% and the average number of app visits per unique user were up 34%. During the year, we also increased our investment in support of our employees. Early on in the pandemic, we continue to pay employees who weren't working for a full month after we closed our stores to customer shopping. We paid hourly appreciation pay for those who were working on the front lines, and established multiple hardship funds for anyone impacted physically, emotionally or financially by COVID. We provided enhanced benefits that included 100% coverage of COVID related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leaves, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring, reimbursement, and access to physical and mental health virtual visits. Including our estimates for fiscal '22, we will have invested more than $75 million on enhancements to our structural employee benefits over a 3-year period. In addition to enhanced benefits, starting in August, we raised the starting minimum wage to $15 per hour for all our employees, which brought our average hourly wage for hourly employees up to $17.67. To show our appreciation for their hard work over the past year and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we are paying employees an additional cash gratitude bonus. In the next few weeks, all hourly U.S employees will receive $500 as full time and $200 as part time or occasional seasonal. In addition, to help keep employees and customers safe, we are encouraging all employees to get COVID vaccinations as they are available by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that weren't there needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination. In all, the COVID related decisions we have made since the beginning of the pandemic, support our employees totaled more than $350 million. This includes paying employees while they were working during store closures, appreciation pay, guaranteed pay, bonuses, vaccination support and hardship funds. We've also deepened our commitment to community. Last year we made a $40 million donation to the Best Buy foundation to accelerate the progress toward our goal to reach 100 Teen Tech Centers across the U.S. And we committed to making systemic permanent changes that address social injustices to improve our company and our communities. We also signed the climate pledge committing to be carbon neutral across our operations by 2040, a decade earlier than our previous goal of 2050. We were honored to be recognized for our efforts by Barron's earlier this month, when we were named to the top of their most sustainable public companies list. The list rated the 1000 largest public companies on five key stakeholder categories, shareholders, employees, customers, community and planet.  Notably, Best Buy was also called out as the company with the leading COVID response, citing our efforts to maintain employee and customer safety, help employees experiencing hardship, and continue to meet the technology needs of customers. This is the fourth time we have been in the top five and the second time we have been in the number one position. As we think about our strategy moving forward, many of the things we discussed at our 2019 investor update came to life in a very accelerated way last year. It is important to reiterate the following three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that are shaping our strategic priorities. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. It's too early to know exactly how much of our sales and customer shopping activity will be via digital channels over time. But as I mentioned earlier, online sales were up 43% of our domestic -- online sales worth 43% of our domestic sales in fiscal '21. And we are planning for the mix to be approximately 40% in fiscal '22. That compares to 19% in fiscal '20 and only 5% just 10 years ago. Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. And three, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. We play a vital role in bringing technology to life for both our customers and our vendor partners. These concepts are extensive and interdependent, and we are as quickly as possible, both implementing change today and assessing future implications across our entire business, including how we evolve our stores and labor model, and how we spend our investment dollars. Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve four shopping needs; inspiration, research, convenience, and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We must be ready to serve all of these needs at all times in all channels. We are building all of our experiences around meeting these needs as we move from being a big box retailer with a strong omni-channel presence to an omni-channel retailer with a large store footprint for support and fulfillment. Fundamentally, when you're looking for help and want to be inspired, the best experience will always be in our stores talking to one of our amazing employees. The proximity to a physical store still matters to many customers. And our stores serve an important role in fulfillment and support and also provide awareness and convenience that are critical to retaining and growing sales. But we also know that customer shopping behaviors are changing, and we need to evolve with them. In the fourth quarter, the pandemic drove a roughly 15% reduction in traffic to our stores, including both in-store shoppers and customers picking up online orders via in-store or curbside. And while some traffic will likely shift back to our store channel in fiscal '22, like many retailers, we believe much of what we saw last year will be permanent. Our employees and the stores will always be central to our strategy. We are simply looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet customer expectations and needs. As we discussed last quarter, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives in order to chart the best path forward. We must balance urgency for teams with the need to learn and understand how customer shopping behavior is changing. We are already gathering learnings and iterating on our initiatives. An example is our ship-from-store hub pilot that we've talked about for the past few quarters. During Q4, we used 340 stores or roughly 35% of our store locations to handle about 70% of our total ship-from-store units. We believe that we can achieve similar results consolidating volume, using a smaller group of stores as hubs over time. In addition, in a subset of these stores, we plan to reduce the sales floor square footage and install warehouse grade packaging station equipment and supplies. As a result, we expect to drive both efficiency and effectiveness. We also continue to pilot reduce selling square footage and alternative layouts in a number of stores in the Minneapolis market. As you would expect, pandemic or not, we're constantly looking at our store network, responding to customer and demographic shifts just as any retailer does. We will continue our normal review process, which involves putting stores through rigorous evaluations as their leases come up for renewal. As we look to the near-term, there will be higher thresholds on renewing leases as we evaluate the role each store plays in its market, the investments required to meet our customer needs, and the expected return based on a new retail landscape. For context, we have approximately 450 leases coming up for renewal in the next 3 years, or an average of 150 each year. As part of the review process, we have closed approximately 20 large format locations each of the past 2 years, and expect to close a higher number this year. We have also been reducing the length of our average lease term, which will continue to provide us flexibility. In addition to our physical stores, our operating model needs to evolve to meet our customers changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels, has forced us to look at how we get our work done. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates, and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. This too was a hypothesis we shared at our 2019 investor update and was massively accelerated by customer shopping behavior changes. Since the pandemic began, our overall headcount has been going through a transformation. As a reminder, we made the difficult decision to furlough approximately 51,000 retail employees due to store closures last April. By August, we have brought back about two thirds of them. As we approached the fourth quarter any remaining employees that had been on furlough were asked to return to work as seasonal employees for the holidays. As employees who were on furlough decided not to come back and other employees left as a result of attrition, we have not been backfilling positions as we consider how to adjust our operations to better meet our customers' needs going forward. As a result, we entered fiscal '21 with 123,000 employees across the entire organization and we are leaving the year with about 102,000 team members, a decline of roughly 21,000 or 17%. Even though headcount across the enterprise has been declining primarily due to this attrition, we still have had to make difficult decisions. Earlier this month, one of those decisions was to adjust the mix of full time and part time employees at each of our store locations. At an aggregate level, this was due to having too many full time and not enough part time employees. As part of the process, part time roles were offered to many of the displaced full time employees who were interested and qualified. The end result was that we laid off and provided severance to approximately 5,000 employees, the majority of which were full time. At the same time, we are adding approximately 2,000 additional part time positions. Decisions like these are never easy or taken lightly, but they position us to be more responsive and flexible as we continue to refine our operating model going forward in response to the incredibly rapid change and how customers want to shop with us. It is important to add that we are intent on rescaling and retraining employees wherever possible, so we can retain our people and employees can flexibly work across all our channels. Our vision of a flexible workforce is about more than having our associates gain the knowledge and skills to be effective in more areas within the traditional store setting. It expands to include the type of interactions that have become even more relevant in a digital shopping environment. Over the past year, thousands of employees who possess unique skills were leveraged across multiple areas of our business, like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. In addition, we are investing in people and hiring in areas like supply chain, small parcel delivery, customer care and technology in support of our long-term strategy. As the last year has demonstrated, technology is playing an even more crucial role in people's lives. We are excited about the technology trends and innovation we see over the next several years. As expected, there's been immense innovation in the consumer health category. The fitness industry has pivoted quickly, and the category is exploding as consumers want to stay fit at home and outfit home gyms. Beyond the connected equipment, customers now have the ability to integrate data for different types of activities like rowing, biking, and running into any number of wearable devices to measure their overall fitness and progress more seamlessly. There is also innovation around more chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, with wearables that monitor insulin levels and heart rates. Hearing aids is another category going through innovation and we are excited to help our customers with hearing needs both online and in our stores. The proliferation of health related devices has become so great. We created a health and wellness digital shopping experience accessible directly from the homepage of our website. Of course, there's an innovation curve in products that help people work-at-home as well. There's an influx of products around all aspects, from high tech chairs to monitors to standing desks. These are products that were not even on vendor roadmaps before the pandemic and now truly complete the working at home experience. Access to 5G is still growing as networks are rolling out across cities. As we move into next year and the year after, it will be more mainstream and accessible for all of us. We are excited about the introduction of new products over time that will leverage the speed and capabilities of 5G beyond the mobile phone. Of course our customers expect Best Buy to be there to help inspire and support all their technology. Our consultation program continues to be an important differentiator and advisors are inspiring technology solutions by a customer consultations happening in homes, digitally in stores and via chat and phone. We are also leveraging our consultation program with our partners. For example, customers can schedule an appointment with one of our advisors while shopping on samsung.com. On the support side, our Total Tech Support program continues to receive very strong customer rating, and is a unique program that we believe only we can offer. Membership growth recovered after we opened our stores more broadly. We continue to see significant opportunity over time to evolve all of our many customer memberships, which also includes our millions of My Best Buy customers. We purposefully press pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic and are planning to roll out a pilot in the next few months that will leverage our learnings from the material evolution of customer shopping behavior over the past year. I'd also like to update you on our health business more broadly. The pandemic has only served to underscore our purpose and strategy. The adoption of virtual care and telehealth by patients and physicians have been greatly accelerated by COVID-19 and is expected to continue to grow. We see significant opportunity over the long-term to make the experience much better for both patients and physicians by providing an integrated seamless technology solution that is easy to use. To that end, our Best Buy health strategy focuses on three areas that start with our strength in retail, and build to connecting patients and physicians. The first focus area is the consumer health category I spoke about a little earlier. These products are for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better, or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease for example. The second area is active ageing, which includes device based emergency response and other services for generation A, who wish to continue to live independently in their homes. Active ageing builds on the GreatCall CST and Biosensics acquisitions. The third focus area is virtual care, and includes digital health caring center services that connect patients and physicians to enable virtual care and remote patient monitoring. We provide personal emergency response, remote patient monitoring, and care counseling services to payers serving Medicare Advantage and Medicaid populations. And we will expand these services to help people monitor their chronic disease and connect to their physician. Our differentiated approach combines Best Buy's in-home and care counseling services with digital health. By digital health we mean curated monitoring devices, packaged with the consumer in mind with a platform to distribute, activate and test the devices to ensure the consumer can use them and connect to their physician. In fiscal '22, we plan to expand the consumer health product assortment and additional devices and services to our active ageing business and add new remote patient monitoring offerings and a new technology platform in virtual care. In order to do this, we plan to invest in people, product development and the ongoing development of our health technology platform and our data analytics and intelligence engines. In addition to the investments in our health strategy, our investments in technology and automation will be important aspects in defining how our model continues to evolve in the future. As has been our practice for the past 8 years, we have continued our commitment to leverage cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures. Our current target set in 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25. We achieved approximately $340 million toward our new goal during fiscal '21, taking our total to $500 million towards this goal. In summary, during fiscal '21, we managed through the challenging environment in a way that allowed us to accelerate many aspects of our strategy to deliver on our purpose, and thrive in a new and forever changed environment. Our teams collectively changed the way we do business at a pace we never imagined. And I must reiterate how proud I am of their perseverance and commitment. As a result, we advanced our 5-year plan both strategically and financially much further than we expected. While we are ahead of plan in several strategic areas, the disruption of the pandemic has also impacted other strategic initiatives. For example, while our health business has proven to be even more strategically relevant to our mission, the pandemic certainly disrupted the progress and the path forward will take time. We also still have meaningful opportunity to evolve our membership and services models to drive loyalty. In addition, we will need to invest in our future as we proactively evolve all the channels of our business to deliver amazing customer experiences in a world where half of the revenue might be initiated online. All that being said, we see a path that leads to margin expansion beyond what we articulated at our last investor update. In fiscal '22, we expect our operating income rate to be lower than fiscal '21s 5.8% operating income rate as we continue to navigate and cycle impacts of the pandemic, while investing in our strategy as Matt will discuss. We are still in the midst of the pandemic, so we are not updating with a specific metric, but we see long-term non-GAAP operating income rate that is beyond the 5% fiscal '25 target we introduced in September 2019. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for fiscal '22. Matthew Bilunas : Good morning. Our financial results for the year far surpassed what we thought was possible entering the year. We are leaving fiscal '21 with an even healthier balance sheet and we -- than when we started the year and saw our non-GAAP operating income rate expand 90 basis points versus the prior year. The rate expansion was possible due to both our ability to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology and by reducing spend early in the year in certain discretionary areas beyond the unknown -- based on the unknown situation we were facing at the beginning of the pandemic. We also accelerated strategies that allowed us to begin adjusting our cost structure to what we believe will be a permanent shift in how customers want to shop. Despite the difficult decisions we made, throughout the year we remain committed on investing in areas we felt were most crucial to delivering our future growth plans. Let me now share more details specific to our fourth quarter. On enterprise revenue of $16.9 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.48, an increase of 20% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 40 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 90 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A, which was partially offset by 60 basis point decline in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rates had a $0.08 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. In our domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 11% to $15.4 billion, an all time high for revenue in a single quarter. Comparable sales growth of 12% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. From a merchandising perspective, we had broad based strength across most of our categories, with the largest drivers of comparable growth coming from computing, appliances, gaming, virtual reality and home theatre. This growth was partially offset by declines in headphones and mobile phones. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate declined to 50 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by supply chain costs associated with a higher mix of online revenue. In the fourth quarter, our online sales were 43% of our overall domestic sales in the quarter compared to 25% last year. Although it was a smaller impact than the supply chain costs, our category mix was also a pressure this quarter. These items were partially offset by a promotional environment that was more favorable compared to last year. Our international non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 180 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to increased supply chain costs from a higher mix of online sales, and a lower sales mix from the higher margin services category. Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 5% compared to last year, and decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were : one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $55 million; two, increased variable costs associated with higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees; and three, technology investments which also included support of our health initiatives. These increased expenses were partially offset by lower store payroll expense. Let me share some additional context on the increased expense from our technology investments. Technology has, and increasingly will be the foundation of how we will operate and how we accelerate our strategy. This includes continued technology investments and capabilities to support our health initiatives, increasing and improving our digital interactions with customers, simplifying tasks in our stores, and building upon our analytics to support decisions we make on a daily basis. We are also modernizing our systems and tools as well as utilizing more cloud based solutions. For example, we are partnering with Microsoft to leverage its cloud to help power our healthcare offerings. In addition, we are transforming the structure of our technology teams by bringing more headcount in-house versus using contract workers. Let me next provide more context on $129 million in restructuring charges from this quarter, which also include a $13 million benefit within cost of sales. About $88 million of the charges related to changes in our domestic segment to realign our organizational structure with our strategic priorities. The remaining $41 million is primarily related to our previously announced plans to exit operations in Mexico. We don't anticipate any additional material charges in Mexico in future quarters, and all of our store locations in Mexico will be closed by the end of Q1. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. At the end of Q4, our inventory balance was approximately 8% higher than last year's comparable period to support the current demand for technology. Approximately half of the year-over-year increase is related to inventory still in transit. Although trends have improved from earlier in the year, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several or key categories. During fiscal '21, we returned $880 million to shareholders through $568 million in dividends and $312 million in share repurchases. We resumed share repurchases during the fourth quarter after suspending activity last March. This morning, we announced a 27% increase in our quarterly dividends to $0.70 per share. We also announced our plans to spend at least $2 billion on share repurchases in fiscal '22. In addition, our Board of Directors approved a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization, replacing the existing authorization dated February 2019, which had a $1.7 billion in repurchases remaining at the end of fiscal '21. As we look to our fiscal '22, we are not providing our traditional guidance, but I would like to share our planning assumptions as we enter the year. As we start fiscal '22, the demand for technology remains at elevated levels and the sales growth momentum we saw in January has continued through the first three weeks of February. The uncertainty around the administration of the COVID vaccine and the subsequent impact of customer demand and shopping patterns makes it difficult to predict how sustainable these trends will be. Other factors to consider include government stimulus actions, and the risk of continued higher unemployment. With that being said, we estimate fiscal '22 total comparable sales growth in the range of down 2% to up 1%. This range reflects a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slowed during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out in the back half of this year. Overall, we expect growth to be positive in the first half of the year, and then negative in the back half as we lap strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21. We will update our expectations during the year if needed, and there's more clarity to the various factors driving our outlook. Regardless, we anticipate revenue for fiscal '22 will be higher than what we would have expected to be at this time last year. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is slightly below our fiscal '21 rate. We anticipate more promotional pressure than we experienced this past year as inventory becomes more available and competition likely increases. As Corie mentioned, we are planning for online sales to represent approximately 40% of our domestic sales in fiscal '22, which is only slightly lower than our x in fiscal '21. As a result, supply chain related costs are not expected to have a material impact on our rate compared to the prior year. From an SG&A standpoint, we are expecting dollars to increase as a percentage in the low single-digit range. There are a number of factors driving the expected increase. First, we expect our SG&A increase -- expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis as we lap COVID related decisions we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend, store overhead items such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping the $40 million donation to the Best Buy foundation we made in Q3 of fiscal '21. Second, we plan to increase our investments in depreciation -- in depreciation in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. Third, we expect store payroll costs to be lower compared to fiscal '21 even after including the impact of lapping $81 million of employee retention credits from the CARES Act we received in the first half of fiscal '21. There are clearly other puts and takes that we will manage through, some that will be more impactful in one quarter versus the next. But the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year. Based on the drivers I just outlined, our expectation is for our operating income rate to decline on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily a result of our increased investments in technology and in support of our health initiatives, as well as the impact of lapping the temporary actions from fiscal '21 I just shared. In relation to capital expenditures, we expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22 compared to $713 million in fiscal '21. Now I will provide some color on Q1. We expect comparable sales to be approximately 20%. As a reminder, in Q1 of last year, we closed all of our stores to customer shopping and move to curbside service only for the last 7 weeks of the quarter. We anticipate our gross profit rate will be slightly lower than last year due to more promotional environment and increased delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during last year's Q1. We expect SG&A dollar -- dollars to increase by approximately 10%. This increase is primarily related to incentive compensation, as we suspended all expense during Q1 last year for corporate and field employees, as well as the gratitude and vaccination related bonuses that Corie discussed. These items combined are expected to result in more than $100 million in additional expense versus last year. In addition, we anticipate increased expense from our investments in technology and health, as well as higher variable expenses associated with expected growth. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We can now take our first question from Anthony Chukumba of Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Anthony Chukumba : Good morning, and congratulations on a strong finish to a -- to an incredible year, particularly given the COVID-19 dystopia that we're all living through. So my question was on the competitive landscape. I mean, it sounds like or I would guess that you're expecting things to be more competitive in 2021, as you said, as the world sort of returns to normal compared to maybe what you saw in 2020. But just would love to have your perspectives on that. That's my one question. Thank you. Corie Barry : Yes, I'll start and Matt can add color. I think we would expect that we actually set it as Matt provided the outlook there to be a higher level of promotionality as we start to lap some of the strengths, obviously, from last year and we start to get into more normalized inventory positions throughout the year. And so part of the color I think that Matt provided for next year would imply that. We likely are going to have to invest a bit more to remain price competitive, which of course, since the beginning has been our priority. So, Anthony, I think your intuition is right there that we would expect things to normalize a bit in terms of promotionality. Anthony Chukumba : Got it. Keep up the good work. Corie Barry : Thanks so much, Anthony. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Horvers : Thank you. Starting with a longer term question and then have a follow-up on something more near-term. As you think about migrating to the new model, obviously, in the consumer electronics, business warranties and accessory attachment are really important. So can you talk about the -- how you see those attachment rates, in-store versus a BOPUS and versus online. Are you building an expectation that you can improve that attachment rate as the consumer becomes more digital? Corie Barry : So I'm going to take a little bit of a step back here in that. I think we strongly believe our competitive advantage is our ability to provide both support and advice across all the channels -- any channel that anyone wants to shop in. And obviously, there are different challenges and different modes of doing that across the different channels. But regardless, we know our employee, or our customers, excuse me, are looking for both that advice and that support across channels. And we've been investing in our capabilities and technology in order to deliver that. We've also talked about the fact that what our customers expect from us from a support perspective has changed over time. And it's less about that break, fix support, although that's still important and we need to be there when that happens. And it's much more about supporting your technology seamlessly across your devices. And it's more about is my printer staying on my network? Or is my content streaming the way that I want it to? And hence, the reason we've been migrating to a model that looks more like Total Tech Support, which provides you obviously coverage for all the technology devices in your home, regardless of where you bought them. And so it's not just about now from -- for your question, specifically, digitally, it's not just about the buying experience, it's actually about using digital across all aspects of the shopping experience. And so we have been working and we are continuing to work and if you think about the investments that Matt mentioned, in technology, we're investing in things like video chats, virtual consultations, adding digital checkout in the app, this is still all empowered by our amazing Blue Shirts [ph] who are actually creating these experiences, we're just creating them digitally. And so while the gross margin rate has been lower online, over time it's constantly improving because we're constantly improving that customer experience. And we are seeing increases in our ability to transact Total Tech Support or digital consultations, we're seeing more in-home advisor leads online as an example. So I think it's hard to replace that expertise and support you get by visiting our stores. But we are seeing customers get more comfortable with experiencing some of those things online. And it's less about exactly what channels have happening and more about how to in every channel we interact with you. We are constantly trying to improve that experience. So to your point and your question, it does become more natural to make the buying decisions in a digital environment. Christopher Horvers : Understood. And then, on the first quarter gross margin and inventory and promotional environment, I guess, you have a very strong comp guide in the first quarter. And it doesn't sound like you're fully in stock on items. So why would you expect a more promotional environment in the first quarter? I would -- is that something you're seeing already and sort of early? I would certainly expect that to be the case as you progress through the year, but it would seem like all the pieces put together, it wouldn't seem like the promotional environment would really change year-over-year? Matthew Bilunas : Yes, I will start and Mike or Corie can add. Yes, I think, despite the fact that we do expect some elevated sales in Q1, as we start to enter in especially the latter part of Q1, we're going to be seeing a competitive environment where a lot of our competitors are comping some big numbers of themselves. And so we're just aware of where that might take technology and how we need to stay competitive in that environment. So you're right. There's the tale of Q1 is going to be leading up to the time we close our stores. And then we close our stores for a bit of time, the last other week. So there's a lot of different areas within Q1 and we do think towards the tail end of it, we'll start to see a bit more promotions and competitiveness as we start to see competitors react to their own situations. Christopher Horvers : Understood. Thanks for all the great information. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. When you laid out your comp guidance for the year, how did you factor in the potential for demand being pulled forward, not just the tougher compares you're going to face in the back half? And do you think the potential for demand being pulled forward exists for a multiyear period or is that unfold because of this wallet to shift back to leisure categories it'll happen pretty quickly and be sustained just for a short period of time? And then I\u2019ve one follow-up on your longer term guidance. Matthew Bilunas : Good morning. This is Matt. I'll take that and Corie or Mike can jump in. I think, fundamentally if we step all the way back, we believe the role of technology in people's lives is only intensified as a result of the pandemic and the proliferation of devices in people's lives will continue to support advancement as innovation continues. So that -- and the role we play in that is extremely important and even stronger than it was before. And so as we look at next year, when we think about it being probably a tale of two halves with growth in the first and then declines in the latter, I think we still see opportunity for innovation to keep fundamentally technology important in people's lives. Clearly, at a micro level there, you could imagine some categories could see a little bit of pull at any given point. But there's also an element of personal savings rates being so elevated now. Right now they're about 14%, which is twice what they were going into the pandemic. So there are a lot of puts and takes in the year. Fundamentally, the guide for next year really incorporates a view that as we get to towards maybe the middle of the year, we start to see that shifting of consumer behavior back to places that were a little muted as the pandemic hits. So we wouldn't characterize the pullback, but just a changing of people deciding to use their wallet. Corie Barry : I think no matter what, Michael, people use of technology in their homes, in particular has changed forever. You have more proliferation and you're going to have more people upgrading more products and more people trying to make different ecosystems all try to work together in their homes, which I think regardless of the puts and takes in any one given year is a good thing strategically for us over the longer term. Michael Lasser : Okay. And my follow-up is on the comments around your expectation for your operating margin being above 5%, or the level that you had laid out at your analyst meeting a couple of years ago. And obviously at that time, it was impossible to predict that e-commerce penetration in your business would be as high as it is today this quickly. But presumably now that's a drag relative to what you expected for your profitability back then, is the offset or the entirety of the offset and even more, this new model where you're going to operate a little more efficiently at the store level, or is there other factors that are driving this expectation that your profitability is going to be higher than what you expected a couple of years ago. Thank you. Corie Barry : So I'm going to start with a bit of a strategic lens on that. And then I think Matt can chime in a little bit on the profitability of the [indiscernible] kind of question. When we set that target in 2019, the good news is our strategic hypothesis was spot on. The interesting part is we have made a massive amount of progress even faster, the customer has made a massive amount of progress. We knew digital penetration was going to grow pretty substantially. What we didn't know is that it was going to double in the span of a year. And so we need to take and we are taking the appropriate time to think about the longer term, given these seismic changes that we've seen. And there are lots of uncertainties including the fact we're still in the middle of a pandemic. And so we're testing and piloting a number of different models that are going to balance this kind of urgency for change, with the need to learn how the customer is changing their behavior. But what we can see in front of us, and then what we can see based on the plans we have in places is that we do think there is that room for operating rate expansion. And Matt will talk a little bit about what we're seeing even in the profitability of the channels. Matthew Bilunas : Yes. If you think about the channels, which are increasingly hard to kind of pull apart, as you see elevated levels of online sales, you see a lot more SG&A leverage because there's a lower fixed cost basis to that. And so, while the gross margins are tend to be lower because they don't -- our stores provide an expert service and support that only our people can give. We do see a SG&A cost structure that is less. And so our job is to actually how to optimize both those channels together to provide the same level of expertise and support, but also allow the support and convenience as they work together. But that fixed cost leverage that you get online is important as you start to look further in the year-end with elevated levels of online mix. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much and good luck. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Peter Keith of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning. It's actually [indiscernible] on for Peter. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about your full year gross margin guidance, expectations to be down a little bit. I was wondering can you just discuss some of the puts and takes there, strategy down a little bit out there 60 basis points of decline this year, and expectations for online next to moderate that. So just wondering any detail there. Thank you. Matthew Bilunas : Sure. So the thing about gross profit next year, what we said was it would be slightly down. I think the biggest part of that are a belief that, like we said that there'll be a bit more promotionality and competitive environment as we start to get into the latter half of Q1 going forward. There's also periods of time where we had some -- our stores closed, we did -- we were able to offer all of our services or installation delivery, there's a little bit of pressure there. In addition, I think, online mix being assumed at 40% versus 43% this last year, is that a meaningful difference in terms of the impact of supply chain costs. So that's why we don't think supply chain costs fundamentally are much of a benefit as you start to move into next year as you are assuming the same amount of sales between the [indiscernible] years. I also think within there, you've got a little bit of -- a promotional favorability was offset by a little bit of category mix changes that'll happen throughout the year. So fundamentally it's that assumption that online mix which stays pretty much the same. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, Matt. Appreciate that. Maybe just separately, quickly, turning on the semiconductor charges that have been reported recently. Can you discuss how this might be impacting price availability currently, or perhaps in the coming quarters? Michael Mohan : Yes. Now it's Mike Mohan in here. Thanks for the question. I think it was around semiconductor availability [indiscernible] , which is clearly a lot of that in the news right now because we need semiconductors in almost everything that's being made. We feel pretty good because we have long-term plans with our vendors upstream for finished goods, whether they're coming from Asia or parts of the rest of the world. And there's sporadic shortages just based on demand peaks right now. Our online of sight to the incoming inventory feels good on where we're at. I think there will some impacts in other industries, but I wouldn't be the expert to speak about it here. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. Appreciate the color. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Joe Feldman : Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on inventory, how we should think about inventory through this year? It sounded like we're still -- you're still a little chasing in some categories, or where there's some lightness. But I was thinking, you do get back into stock and inventory was up maybe half percent or so this past quarter, which seemed like in a better position. Maybe you can just take us through the year how to think about it, like, should we end the year or come through the year up a little bit inventory, down a little bit? How do we think about it? Michael Mohan : Hey, Joe. It's Mike. I will start and Matt or Corie can chime in. We feel better about our inventory position now versus the last four calls we've had. So I'll start with that, because we've finally gotten back into better stock. That That said, we still have constraints in parts of our business that we don't think we will solve themselves in the first half of this year. Gaming is a good example. We have yet to put the new generation of gaming consoles into our stores, we anticipate to do that soon. But we haven't done that because there just hasn't been enough inventory to meet demand. So those are some of the things that pandemic aside, it would have likely been constrained and is only more heightened based on people wanting to dramatically change their at home experiences. Other categories like printing have been constrained since the sort of pandemic and there's some challenges in that industry at large getting back into a better inventory position. I think it was some of the bigger categories around computing and home theatre, we're going through some natural time transitions. This would be our second home theatre transition as an example during a pandemic. And I think our vendors are getting smarter about the timing of new model introductions, and then what do they use for demand generation. So I can't give you a good window as to what our inventory will look like 12 months from now. I feel we're going to be in better stock overall, but we'll still have a handful of constraints that we have to navigate through. I think the one thing our teams really do well, and I know that you know this, but we work so far upstream [ph] with all of our partners with collaborative forecasting, demand generation, even feature sets on models, which then actually help us give us help -- give our vendors the best forecast possible. So I always look at our forecast accuracy and percent to fill and I feel really good about what I can see going forward and then the rest is based on consumer demand. And I think Matt talked about there's some things on the back half of this year that we have to plan for two different vectors on and I know our teams will be ready. Joe Feldman : Got it. Thanks. And then, if I could ask a follow-up on a separate topic. With regard to digital in the stores and fulfillment, like I guess, when you were talking about retraining re-skilling, is that related to having to teach the employees to do a better job of fulfilling orders and shipping and doing things beyond [technical difficulty] servicing the electronics, support when people come in? Like is it more about the digital support than the in-person support? Corie Barry : Thanks for the question, Joe. It's a little bit about everything you just mentioned, in fact. And so in other words, there are multiple ways in which employees can in many cases opt into gaining further certifications and skills. Sometimes that looks like within the four walls of the store. I might opt into garnering more skills in home theatre and computing, I might opt into garnering more skills around services, therefore I am more flexible throughout the store. In some cases, that might also mean I am willing to spend some of my time doing fulfillment work, fulfilling on car side -- curbside, excuse me, orders, or packing inventory in the back out of some of those ship-from-store locations. So I may add those skills, which might add more hours and more flexibility. And then there are some real digital experiences that we are leveraging our associates for. I might opt into being able to answer calls from a national call queue, while I'm on my shift, it's not that busy, and I can pick up a customer's question by a call, or I might opt into being more of a -- an expert that's virtual, that can help you with whatever your question is in a virtual connection through our app. All of those are different ways in which we're rescaling. And then you can imagine on top of that, there might be flexibility to go work in a supply chain location, or there might be flexibility to train myself into more of a technology job and be able to do that remotely. And so in all of those different vectors, we are actually starting to create training modules and create opportunities for our employees, not just for us to them flexibly, but for them to flexibly opt into different roles and different hours in a way that might meet their lives with a little bit more flexibility and progress their careers, frankly. Joe Feldman : That's helpful. It makes a lot of sense. And good luck this quarter. Thanks. Corie Barry : Thanks, Joe. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Karen Short. Karen Short : [Technical difficulty] fiscal '22 in terms of operating margins with respect to that 5% target. So when I look at the ranges that you provided, I kind of back into a range of EBIT margins of 4.2% to 4.7%. And so I guess, in the context of that 5% target remaining intact, that does seem like a fairly, at least on the low end, big leap to make to get that to the 5% target. So I'm wondering if you could comment a little bit on that. And correct me if I'm wrong in terms of the math on that range? And then I had a follow-up. Matthew Bilunas : Sure. I think for the full year, if we think about the top -- if we use the top end of the range, zero comp, we're likely -- our math would indicate a range that's a little bit higher than that, about 5%. That's assuming a 3%-ish sales, our SG&A increase and slight moderation or decline in operating or gross profit rate. So we -- the top end of the range should imply something that's a little north of five. Now certainly as you start to slip towards the bottom of that range, we'll look at decisions that we need to make to see if we -- where we want to end the year from an operating rate perspective. We do believe we're in a very strong position financially and we probably would resist making short-term decisions to overly manufacturer rate when we know we need to invest for our future so, but the top end of our guidance should imply something north of 5%. Karen Short : Okay. And then wondering just generally speaking, I know you gave a lot of details on the number of employees. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about what you think the optimal full time versus part time mix was? And as you said, obviously, you skewed or you had, I think a higher percent of full time but not by -- not that much. So wondering how you're thinking about that optimal mix with 102,000 in mind? Corie Barry : Yes, it's a little hard for me to say what's optimal when we're still striking the balance between learning about what we think the right operating model is for the future and where we are today. And so I don't -- I would hesitate to comment on what we think the optimal mix is. I think what's important for us right now is we are trying to build in flexibility that will allow us to meet the customer wherever they're deciding to interact with us across those channels. And we'll bring a little less about exactly what the optimal mix is and instead really trying to figure out how best can we use that and play our space across all the things that we need to do, and therefore staff appropriately against that. So I -- optimal, I don't think we know yet, given that we're still in the midst of a pandemic, we still have a lot of unknowns in front of us. But we do feel pretty strongly that we are now set up in a better position to be able to flex with the changing customer dynamic. Karen Short : Great. Thanks very much. Corie Barry : Thank you. Oh, and with that, I think that was our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to updating you as we continue to progress against our strategies. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q1 financial results, which include comparable sales growth of 37% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of more than 230%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year that included both periods of high demand and periods when our stores were closed to customer traffic. When we compare to 2 years ago, our results are very strong. Compared to the first quarter of fiscal '20, revenue is up 27% and our earnings per share are up more than 100%. Customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter was extraordinarily high. This demand is being driven by continued focus on the home, which encompasses many aspects of our lives, including working, learning, cooking, entertaining, redecorating and remodeling. The demand was also bolstered by government stimulus programs and the strong housing environment. Our teams across the organization met that demand with remarkable execution. From our merchant and supply chain teams working behind the scenes to our Blue Shirts and Geek Squad agents on the front lines. Our employees once again showed amazing flexibility and execution managing extraordinary volumes. Most importantly, they provided exceptional customer service in a safe environment. From a merchandising perspective, we saw strong comparable sales across virtually all product and service categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, computing and appliances. With the extraordinarily high customer demand, as well as production and distribution disruptions, product availability constraints continued to be a theme during Q1, as they have been throughout the pandemic, particularly in large appliances, computing, televisions and gaming. Our teams collaborated closely and effectively with our vendors to bring in as much inventory as possible. This is a testament to the trust and unique relationships that our merchants have built with vendors over decades of partnership. Our results this quarter also highlight the strength of our supply chain. We were able to efficiently move the amount of inventory necessary to drive 37% comp sales growth, while navigating record demand across retail, container shortages and port congestion. We also improved our speed to customer, as our online sales package delivery was not only much faster than last year, it was faster than 2 years ago pre-pandemic. In fact, same-day delivery to customer\u2019s homes was up 90% on a year-over-year basis. In addition, we continue to leverage our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q1, about 60% of our online revenue was either picked up in store or curbside, shipped from a store or delivered by a store employee, which is becoming an increasingly important aspect of our delivery experience. The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 44%, similar to last year's first quarter. This strong performance would not have been possible without an amazing and resourceful team of people and the multi-year investments we have made in our supply chain transformation. Best Buy has a unique ability to inspire and support customers in ways no one else can. And as the impacts of the pandemic have evolved, customers across all age demographics are feeling more comfortable coming back into stores to see products firsthand, seek expert advice from our associates or get technical support from our Geek Squad agents. At the same time, sales originating online continued to be much higher than pre-pandemic and were 33% of our domestic sales compared to 15% 2 years ago in Q1 of fiscal '20. In addition, we continue to innovatively help customers via phone and chat. We learned a great deal last year by bringing more of our expert Blue Shirts onto our digital and phone platforms to support our customers. In fact, most aspects of our unique and full suite of services have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. For example, install, delivery and in-store and in-home repair volume is all up over last year and higher than 2 years ago. Active My Best Buy loyalty program members have grown considerably, and members are using the program more than last year and 2 years ago. Our Total Tech Support Membership acquisition metrics, such as sales per store per day, have rebounded and are even higher than what they were 2 years ago. In addition, total usage of the program is up more than last year and 2 years ago. During Q1, we saw strong growth from engaged and re-engaged customers. Starting at the beginning of the pandemic through March, we saw elevated growth in new customers. In total, new customer growth was about 50% higher than pre-pandemic levels. These new customers gained during the pandemic have slightly different demographics from our historical new customers, such as slightly younger, slightly more female and slightly lower income. We are encouraged by the fact that we are retaining these new customers at rates similar to historical levels, considering they are not only a slightly different demographic, but they also represent a much larger group of new customers than we have historically seen. As I mentioned earlier, online sales were 33% of domestic sales this quarter compared to 15% 2 years ago in Q1 of fiscal '20. For the year, we have updated our working assumption regarding the mix of online sales, and now expect it to be in the mid 30% range from our original expectation of approximately 40%. This compares to 19% for the full year 2 years ago in fiscal '20. Nevertheless, clearly, the pandemic has accelerated the evolution of customer shopping behavior. Our research indicates our customers look to Best Buy to serve four distinct shopping needs, inspiration, research, convenience and support. And customers expect to be able to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels. We have a unique ability to serve all of these needs, at all times, in all channels. We are currently looking at how we can best deploy our team and our physical assets to meet these customer expectations and needs. As we discussed in our past few earnings calls, we are taking the opportunity to test and pilot a range of models and initiatives to better understand how we can leverage our stores and facilities for more fulfillment purposes and how we can deliver customer experiences with a more flexible and engaged workforce. Late last year, we launched a pilot in Houston to test a much more experiential store. For example, from an inspire and support standpoint, it has new PC gaming, headphone and fitness experiences, as well as fully re-modeled premium home theater and appliance experiences. In addition, it has a much bigger Geek Squad presence in the store. From a fulfillment standpoint, we reoriented the location of the store warehouse to be adjacent to a new covered drive-up curbside experience and lockers. Early results from this pilot show higher NPS and sales relative to its group of control stores. Late last year, we also began piloting new store formats to test our hypothesis of stores as more primary fulfillment hubs in four Minneapolis locations. In these locations, we reduced the shoppable square footage to provide incremental space for staging product for in-store pickup and to support ship from store transactions. The product assortment on the sales floor still includes the primary categories these locations had before the remodel, but the merchandise SKU count is reduced to focus on the most popular items. Accordingly, the pilot stores have fewer store associates, and we are testing a queue functionality for customers who would like to consult with an associate. In one of the four locations, we are utilizing some of the available space to increase the previous allocation to our Geek Squad business. Our goal is to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction, while reducing selling square footage, improving speed and convenience and operating a more efficient model. We will continue to refine and iterate to learn and evolve our hypothesis. Later this year, we will be piloting a new market approach. To best address local customer needs, we will leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, in outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. From a physical store standpoint in this market we will be testing an array of different prototypes, including 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square foot stores, a new outlet store and even smaller 5,000 square foot stores. Our goal is to improve customer penetration by delivering new, more efficient and still experiential store formats that are more proximate and relevant to customers. In addition, we believe we can operate more efficiently. For example, by reducing total retail square footage across the market, reducing open box costs, and improving utilization of our repair and auto tech capability. We also continue to refine our ship from store hub concept. While all stores will continue to ship online orders, we are driving efficiency and effectiveness by consolidating ship from store units in a limited number of stores across the country. In addition to our physical stores, our operating model is evolving to meet our customers changing shopping behaviors that have been accelerated by the pandemic. The sudden and lasting, shift customers have made to shopping more regularly and seamlessly across all of our channels, has amplified the need to look at how we get our work done. As we think about our labor operating model, we are designing for employee choice, flexibility and career opportunity. Our response to the pandemic has shown our ability to be successful when broadening the scope of responsibility of our associates and has highlighted the importance of ongoing flexibility and adaptability. A core aspect of our strategy going forward is up-skilling and re-skilling field employees. The benefits of this go beyond just a more flexible workforce. Yes, it allows our employees and us to schedule shifts more flexibly within the store and between channels, like virtual sales, chat, phone and remote support. But just as importantly, our employees are gaining skills that can be used across their career journey, and they are gaining more confidence. Early results are showing us that once employees add skills, they tend to drive a higher customer NPS. And we are making significant progress, as to date thousands of employees have earned multiple skill sets. As we continue to evolve our labor model, we have not lost sight of the competitive advantage our team members provide, especially in more complex sales transactions. Specifically, our in-home advisers, the Pacific Kitchen & Home Experts and Magnolia system designers have the unique ability to create and build relationships and have developed clienteling skills. Earlier this month, we brought these three previously siloed teams together into one team. This will allow us to serve customers more seamlessly across all the ways they want to interact with us, whether it is virtually, in our stores or in their homes. This change positions our most skilled employees against the most complex work within an entire market and will provide improved career progression opportunities for our sales team. Now called consultants and designers, the members of this coordinated team currently number nearly 3,000. We shared last quarter, that our overall headcount was down approximately 17% as we entered the fiscal year. The percent of our total employees that are now full time is approximately 60% compared to 54% pre-pandemic. We are iterating to find the balance between providing employees full time opportunities that come with benefits and guaranteed hours and schedules, while also maintaining the flexibility that is often important in retail. Overall, we are doubling down on the expertise by investing in our people, in their training, skill sets and career progression. We also continue to expand our employee benefits, most recently adding new programs focused on diabetes, physical therapy, and supporting and advocating for employees in the LGBTQIA+ community, and those managing complex chronic or ongoing care needs. These are in addition to benefits we added over the past few years, that include 100% coverage of COVID-related health care expenses, expanded caregiver leave, additional support for backup childcare, tutoring reimbursement, and access to physical and mental health virtual visits. In addition, to show our appreciation for their hard work over the last several months and in recognition of their ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we paid employee gratitude bonuses this year. In March, all hourly US employees received $500 at full time and $200 at part time or occasional seasonal. Furthermore, all hourly field employees will receive an incremental $150 recognition award over the next two weeks. Clearly, the landscape as it relates to the pandemic has been changing rapidly. And we remain keenly focused on keeping employees and customers safe. We are continuing to encourage all employees to get COVID vaccinations by providing them with paid time-off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects that warrant their needing to stay home and rest after receiving the vaccination. I would like to now share the latest developments of our membership strategy. As we mentioned on our last call, we purposefully pressed pause on this initiative at the start of the pandemic. Last month, we began piloting a new membership program called Best Buy Beta in 60 stores. This offer combines compelling benefits from our total tech support program, our My Best Buy loyalty program and our credit card program, in addition to other benefits. To be clear, what we are piloting is not in direct competition with Amazon Prime, Walmart Plus, or frankly, any other membership programs in the market today. It is playing to our unique strengths and what customers want from Best Buy. It includes exclusive member pricing, unlimited Geek Squad technical support, up to 2 years of warranty protection on product purchases, a 60 day extended return window, free standard shipping and delivery, and free installation on most products and appliances. I would note that all Best Buy customers already receive free and fast shipping on orders over $35, while Best Buy Beta customers get free and fast shipping on everything, including same-day deliveries. Membership also includes access to a support concierge service that is available only to Best Buy Beta members. The Best Buy Concierge team is available 24/7 by phone, chat, e-mail or through the Best Buy app. The cost is the same as our current total tech support program, $199.99 per year or $179.99 [ph] per year for the Best Buy credit card holders. The goal of Best Buy Beta is to create a membership experience that customers will love and value, which in turn results in a higher customer lifetime value and drives a larger share of CE wallet dollars to Best Buy. It is very early, and the test results and insights will inform what we ultimately end up rolling out on a national level. But so far, we like what we are seeing from a customer and employee proposition perspective. Changing topic for a moment, I want to reflect on the fact that this week marks the one year anniversary of George Floyd's murder. For us, his death last year was a long overdue catalyst for change. And as you may recall, I shared at that time that we would do better, and I'm proud to report that we have on many fronts. One area of particular emphasis for us is our role in underserved communities. In fact, just last week, we announced we're investing $10 million over 5 years to create pathways to opportunity for teams from disinvested communities in Los Angeles. As part of that effort, we will build a network of 10 to 12 team tech centers, providing access to cutting edge technology, scale building and career mentorship, with a specific focus on connections and training in creative and entertainment careers. We will also provide localized post-secondary guidance, scholarships and mental health and wellness support. This Los Angeles community Impact Hub is a key step toward our goal to build a network of 100 team tech centers by 2025, which is part of our broader commitment to address technology, inequities and advance economic and social justice. One particularly exciting aspect of this initiative is that we are using a new approach that engages deep partnerships with like minded public and private organizations in the local community. In this case, founding partners Annenberg Foundation and Greater LA Education Foundation, and a variety of vendor partners and other organizations. We believe this will be an effective model for amplifying our social impact efforts, and we expect to deploy something similar in other markets. In summary, the year has clearly started out much stronger than we originally expected. That momentum is continuing into Q2, and we are raising our outlook. As we think more short term, specifically the back half of this year, we expect shopping behavior will continue to evolve, as customers are able to spend more time on activities like eating out, traveling and other events. And there remains uncertainty as to how this may impact our business, especially as we lap particularly strong sales in the back half of last year. That being said, there are a number of factors that reinforce our confidence over the longer term. First, it has become evident throughout the pandemic that technology is even more important to people's lives. And we are excited about what that means for our business going forward, especially in combination with both the heightened technology innovation that supports our more home based way of work and life and our unique ability to inspire and support our customers. These are permanent structural shifts that we are seeing towards more hybrid work and learning models, streaming entertainment and a sustained focus on the home. This increased penetration of consumer electronics presents opportunity, as we grow our consultative in-home model to help our customers optimize the potential of their technology, as well as our unique support model that keeps it all working the way they want.  Second, we believe the consumer is in a materially improved position, with higher savings, stronger credit, more prolific vaccination and more available jobs. Third, even with the elevated demand we have seen throughout the pandemic, we believe the nesting phenomenon will continue to drive demand for products and services that help customers improve their home experience. And our vendor partners are already innovating to create new solutions that cater to this nesting phenomenon, like cameras and televisions and portable computing geared toward video interactions.  And fourth, we believe there remains opportunity in the install base that has not yet replaced or upgraded their technology products. For example, NPD estimates 15% of the TV installed base upgraded more quickly than expected. There is also opportunity in low penetration categories, like health, fitness and small appliances that have room for growth. Furthermore, inventory constraints in areas like gaming support sustained demand as customers continue to seek out ways to entertain at home.  But before I turn the call over to Matt, I want to say a few words about Mike Mohan, who is participating today in his last earnings call as Best Buy's President and COO. When Mike shared that it might be time for him to leave Best Buy, I was met with many emotions. We've worked together for so many years and built a true friendship I have grown to cherish. As his friend, I was proud that he was ready to leave the company he loves and set out to pursue his desire to do more. As a colleague, I was truly saddened that the idea that I wouldn't be able to count on his advice and insights as I have for so long. What Mike leaves behind is a legacy of countless people whose careers he supported and thousands of decisions, large and small, that always prioritized Best Buy's success in good times and bad.  When things were at their worst, he helped study the company with his trademark candor and almost intuitive understanding of what makes this company tick. We saw him at its best this past year, bringing a lifetime of experience to drive clarity in a truly unique time. Most significantly, he has created a team that is, I believe, the best in the country, a team that will now step up and build on the strengths and growth opportunities that Mike himself has been so instrumental in creating. Because we will not be replacing either the President or Chief Operating Officer role, three of Mike's six direct reports will now report to me. They include Rob Bass, who continues to run our Supply Chain and Global Properties organization, Damien Harmon, as our Head of Omnichannel Operations, and Jason Bonfigt, who is our Chief Merchant. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for details on our results and insights on our outlook for next quarter and the full year. Matthew Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. Let me start by thanking our employees for the extraordinary results they delivered in the first quarter. Our team's ability to not only keep pace with the strong customer demand, but also provide an unmatched customer experience, while making strategic progress is truly remarkable. As a result, our performance was well-ahead of our working assumptions we laid out at the start of the quarter. Enterprise comparable sales growth of 37% far surpassed our estimate of approximately 20%. We were able to capitalize on the elevated demand for technology that has remained throughout the pandemic. The sales originating from inside our stores was also higher than we anticipated and was a contributor to our higher sales volume versus expectations. In addition, our original outlook did not include the benefit of the March stimulus payments. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate improved approximately 30 basis points versus last year, which exceeded our expectations of a slight rate decline. The primary driver was a more favorable promotional environment, as the demand for technology remains strong throughout the entire quarter. In addition, the impact of supply chain costs was slightly favorable to our gross profit rate due to the higher mix of sales originating from our stores. Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew approximately 15% compared to last year, which was higher than our outlook of approximately 10% growth, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and increased variable costs from higher sales. Let me now share more details, specific to our first quarter versus last year. On enterprise revenue of $11.6 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.23, an increase of 233% versus last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 6.4% increased to 350 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by approximately 310 basis points of leverage from the higher sales volume on our SG&A and the 30 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had a $0.14 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS. Store closures in the various operating model changes we experienced last year during the early phases of the pandemic played a factor in our growth this quarter. And will continue to impact our year-over-year financial performance throughout the year. As a reminder, we closed our stores to in-person shopping on March 22, shifting to curbside fulfillment to keep our employees and customers safe. By June 22, most of our stores were open to in-store shopping, with capacity limits and reduced store hours. While these operating model changes certainly impacted our financial results in Q1, they by no means, should take away from the team's ability to successfully execute and serve our customers. As Corie mentioned, when comparing our results against 2 years ago or the first quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 27%. Also, our domestic store channel revenue was higher than 2 years ago, despite more than 40 fewer stores and online revenue growth of 175% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue, our non-GAAP operating income rate was 260 basis points higher this quarter, than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago. Now, moving back to our performance versus last year. In our domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 37% to $10.8 billion. Comparable sales growth of 38% was partially offset by the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. As a reminder, our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in a curbside only operating model during the period. International revenue of $796 million increased to 23%, and included comparable sales growth of 28% and the benefit of approximately 1000 basis points of a favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These items were partially offset by exiting our operations in Mexico, which resulted in approximately $69 million less revenue this quarter compared to last year. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 30 basis points to 23.3%, which was driven by improved product margin rates, which included reduced promotions and rate improvement from our supply chain costs. These items were partially offset by increased large product installation and delivery expense. As a reminder, we suspended in-home services for about 5 weeks during the last years first quarter. Compared to 2 years ago, our gross profit rate this quarter was approximately 40 basis points lower, primarily due to supply chain costs from the higher mix of online revenue. Our international non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 23%, primarily due to improved product margin rates. Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 16% compared to last year and decreased 290 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest driver of the expense increased versus last year were, one, higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $190 million, including approximately $40 million [ph] for the gratitude and appreciation awards, Corie mentioned earlier. Two, technology investments, which also includes support of our health initiatives. And three, increased variable costs associated with a higher sales volume, which included items such as credit card processing fees. When comparing two years ago, domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $156 million and decreased 280 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were consistent with the drivers versus last year, higher incentive compensation, technology investments and increased variable costs due to higher sales volume, partially offsetting the previous items was lower store payroll expense. Let me share some additional context on higher incentive compensation expense. First, it was much higher than expected in the first quarter due to the strong performance. It also includes the gratitude bonuses that Corie discussed. Second, since we now expect the full year to exceed our original annual incentive performance targets, we expect incentive compensation for the full year to be a larger expense than our original working assumptions. As a reminder, from a comparison standpoint, we did not record short term incentive expense for the first half of last year due to the temporary suspension of our plans. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash and short term investments. At the end of Q1, our inventory balance was 43% higher than last year's comparable period and was 10% higher than our Q1 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology, as well as actions we took last year to lower inventory receipts based on our reduced sales outlook at the time. The health of our inventory remains very strong and the increased in accounts payable this quarter was 44%, which demonstrates the rapid pace we continue to turn our inventory. Although, trends have improved from the early phases of the pandemic, we are still experiencing constraints driven by the high demand in several of our key categories. During the quarter, we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases of $927 million in dividends of $175 million. As we look to the full year, we now expect to spend approximately $2.5 billion in share repurchases during fiscal '22, which compares to our previous outlook of at least $2 billion. Let me next share more color on the full year outlook for fiscal '22. We are encouraged by our results in the first quarter, and our outlook for the second quarter. We now estimate fiscal '22 comparable sales growth in the range of 3% to 6%, which compares to our previous working assumption of down 2% to up 1%. While we continue to believe the role of technology in people's lives has only has only intensified as a result of pandemic, our working assumptions still reflect a scenario in which customers resume or accelerate spend in areas that have slowed from the start of the pandemic and the back half of this year. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately flat to fiscal '21. From an SG&A standpoint, we expect dollars to increase as a percentage of revenue in the range - as a percentage in the range of 6% to 7% consistent with what I shared last quarter. There are a number of factors driving the expense increase. First, we expect our SG&A expense to increase approximately $100 million on a year-over-year basis, as we lap COVID-related we made last year to preserve liquidity. This includes returning to a more normalized spend on items such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend and store overhead items, such as maintenance. This $100 million increase includes the benefit of lapping of $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation that we made in Q3 of fiscal '21. Second, we plan to increase our investments in support of technology and our health initiatives by approximately $150 million compared to fiscal '21. This increase also includes depreciation expense. Third, we now expect our incentive compensation, including gratitude and appreciation awards from Q1 to increase in the range of to $225 million to $275 million. There are clearly other puts and takes that will - we will manage through. Some of that will be more impactful in one quarter versus the next, but the previous items are the key drivers of how we are viewing the full year. In relation to capital expenditure, we still expect to spend approximately $750 million to $850 million during fiscal '22. Now, I will provide some color on our second quarter. We expect comparable sales to be up approximately 17%, the trends we have seen to start this quarter have remained strong, and our revenue growth for the first three weeks of the quarter has been approximately 30%. We anticipate that our gross profit rate will be approximately flat to last year. From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we expect dollars to increase approximately 20% compared to last year. As a reminder, we made several cost decisions at the start of our second quarter last year to align with lower sales and channel trends we were seeing and expecting to continue at that point. The primary drivers that expected year-over-year increase, include, first, we expect our incentive compensation to increase by approximately $100 million, second, we expect our store payroll cost to increase as we lap last years store closures, third, we lap COVID-related decisions we made last year to lower costs and reserve liquidity such as 401(k) company match, advertising spend and store overhead items. In addition, we plan to increase our investments in supportive technology in our health business. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore. Greg Melich : Thanks. I'd love to focus on the two year trends, and particularly, where you think you are gaining share, or maybe you haven't been gaining share, if you look at it now in hindsight. Like, you mentioned, certain categories where things are strong, but just anything else on those new customers you won and how much up that is versus '19? Thank you. Corie Barry : Sure. Greg, I'll start on the share question. Obviously, it's a little bit of a tricky compared to last year because we had our stores closed as Matt said for part of the quarter. So when you look back 2 years, we feel like across the board, we've at least recovered our share positions. If not, you know, there's obviously some puts and takes in categories, but especially as we got the stores back open, we were able to provide those installation and delivery experiences, then you know we were able to recover, especially in some of those large cube areas like appliances and televisions. As it relates to some of the new customers that we're seeing, like we said on the call, we're seeing - we saw about 50% growth in our new customer acquisition. So we're always acquiring new customers, that's the good news. But during the pandemic, we've seen about 50% growth. And like we said it's been skewing towards a slightly different and different customer mix then what we\u2019ve seen, slightly more female, a little bit more low income demographic, and importantly also a younger demographic. For the first time the largest cohort that we have of customers over the last 12 months is actually millennials, which is good when we're also seeing retention levels similar to what we've seen historically with these new customers. Does that help? Greg Melich : That helps a lot. I\u2019ll let somebody else go. Thanks. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Good morning. Great quarter. So my question, you talked a bit about this in the prepared comments with recent trends, but clearly, some significant upside to your sales expectations here in Q1. How much do you think was stimulus driven, and if you look at the ongoing strength in the business here into the second fiscal quarter, is stimulus still playing a factor there? Matthew Bilunas : Yeah. Thanks, Brian. Clearly, we do believe stimulus did play a factor at our performance, as we think about going from Q1 to Q2. March and April, a little stronger than February and as we entered into May, we're starting the quarter off at about 30%. And clearly stimulus, like the other stimulus\u2019s that we saw is playing an impact. It's very difficult to monitor or actually estimate what that is. And it's part of the reason as we look to the future, you know, the back half of this year, we know that it has had some impact and why we would see the back half being a little bit different than the front half of this year. But it clearly is having an impact and we'll have to watch and see where that goes. There is an element of childcare tax credits that are coming that could also help and replace some of the stimulus, so we'll watch that as close as we can. Brian Nagel : Great. Thank you, very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David Bellinger with Wolfe Research. David Bellinger : Hey. Thanks for taking the question. And best of luck to Mike as well here. So in regards to monetizing the Best Buy website and digital properties, I think in the past you previously mentioned around 2 billion visits per year to your site and that number is likely much higher now with the shift to e-commerce. So are you taking any extra measures and monetizing those page views as their, you know, even greater potential for a stream of higher margin revenue to build much more quickly this year and in the years ahead, just given the shift we've had in the overall space? Corie Barry : Yeah. Thank you for the question, David. Well, we haven't really disclosed specific details on it. You can imagine that finding a way to monetize that level of traffic is an important part of the retail model, and that's definitely true for us as it is for any other retailer. Our traffic and our engaged customers are an incredible asset. We think they are very valuable to our brand partners, both currently, but also increasingly, as the media landscape evolves. So, you can imagine that we are leveraging those assets currently. And we're continuing to develop new and differentiated ways in which we can make sure that we optimize that traffic. David Bellinger : Great. Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : Good morning. I wanted to focus on the fulfillment strategies. Maybe a specific focus on, I believe, Corie, you mentioned delivered by employee as a growing sort of method for your customer base. So can you expand on how that works? Like, what these employees are trained to do as they arrive at the customer's home? And how the offering is or how you expect it to impact the evolution of the customer relationship? Corie Barry : Yeah. So first, I'm just going to take one gigantic step back and just say I'm incredibly proud of our supply chain performance and myriad teams that have helped us deliver throughout what is unprecedented demand. And I think it's interesting because there's such a portfolio approach to how we think about supply chain at Best Buy. I mean, it's evolved from the conventional distribution center model. And think about all the touch points we have with customers for fulfillment, vending machines, lockers, alternate pickup locations, curbside, in-store, same-day, next-day, employees, ship from store. I actually think it\u2019s really important to set that context, first, because it allows us a great deal of flexibility to deliver with speed and with convenience to the customer. Specific to what we're seeing with our employee delivery, we saw a bout two times the penetration that we had in Q1 - in Q4, excuse me, into Q1. And what those employees are trained to, they're mostly actually supporting our next day capabilities, and it's actually kind of a surprise and delight moment. They're able to leverage some of the extra capacity, they're driving around the neighborhoods near the store. They're able to walk up deliver that package. And typically, the customer feedback we hear is, I wasn't expecting a Blue Shirt necessarily to come walking up with a package and deliver it safely to my home. So I think it's a way for us to leverage the brand and the unique aspects of our Blue Shirts, but also do with some level of convenience. Mike, do you have something to add? Michael Mohan : Yeah. Steve, I think its great question and I'm excited for what the team has put together. As you look forward, as scheduling, flexibility and some of the systems will enable us to even be more on demand, we really want to have a great experience, so that's why like Corie mentioned most of this is next day, so we can queue it up and have this amazing experience. I think what makes us interesting is that we got the permission from customers to get across the threshold and we're thinking about that quite a bit. So today, it's a ring a doorbell and drop it on the step, but I think you can maybe pull on the string a little bit and we have the ability to get into someone's home, have a conversation, set up a profile, maybe even have a discussion around membership, and potentially get them set up as an advisor. So I think you know, that's one of the things we're excited about the most. But also we\u2019re going to give our employees some choice in the moment if they want to pick up extra income, they can also be doing this and supporting the experience with our customers. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Best of luck. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Corie, it was great to hear about the new pilot. I wondered what the ultimate goal was with these pilots with regard to real estate. Is it about overall less square footage, or is it about shifting square footage from selling to distribution? Corie Barry : I think it's a little bit potentially about both, but I'd argue right now, a little bit more of the latter, where we're trying to figure out what's the right mix of having those distribution facilities that deliver with convenience. But also enough touch points, importantly, so that you also are able to meet the customer expectations. I mean, when still 60% of what we sell is either being picked up in a store or shipped from a store that in-store capability is incredibly important to the customer experience. And so, I will start with where I did in the prepared remarks and that is our number one goal is to ensure seamless customer experiences. And as we said, our customers look to us for everything from inspiration and support, all the way to that really convenient fulfillment opportunity. And so the goal of the test right now is to say, what is the right balance between that really deep experiential selling square footage, that fulfillment square footage that might be behind the scenes. And one of the things that you didn't quite get in the prepared remarks is that often, you might have a little bit less selling square footage, but all the SKUs are available in the back because it's like a mini fulfillment center, so you can still deliver on the customer experiences. And so it's - right now, it's about trying to test how do all these things play together and then what's the right balance that delivers importantly on the customer expectations over time. Kate McShane : Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski with Jefferies. Jonathan Matuszewski : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and nice quarter. I had a follow up on the store pilots, curious how we should think about the portability of some of these that you're running? Clearly, you're very early on here; they're nascent at this stage. But what are the milestones you need to see? And when do you anticipate being at a point when you maybe to think about a broader rollout? Thanks so much. Corie Barry : You bet. I'd start by just reinforcing kind of where I ended the last question and that is we're testing for the right mix of experience, space, and location. And all those things need to play together in the right way. We obviously feel urgency. We want to make sure that we figure this out. But we don't want to be so urgent that we risk the customer and thankfully also the employee experience in this work. And it's important to note, we're not even in a normalized environment yet, right? We still have the impacts of COVID. You have stimulus like there's a lot of things still impacting shopping behavior, which means you don't want to take a false read, and then roll some of these out. And then even the full market tests that I was talking about on the call, that's set to launch in the back half of this year. So we haven't even started the launch on that one. So we don't have anything to announce today. We wanted to start to give you more clarity on the true impacts we're trying to test the true market level test that we\u2019re doing. And we want to make sure wasn't just seen as done [ph] the fulfillment inside that is also the new experiential aspects that we're adding. And I think we would say we have a pretty good history of rolling out concepts as soon as we feel like we have the right case sitting behind them. And so, as we know more about and feel like we have a sustained understanding of what each of these concepts does for the customer and the employee, then we'll come back to you with the more distinct rollout plans. Mike? Michael Mohan : Maybe you know, adding on to what Corie said, Jonathan, maybe two other things is, I just want to reinforce. We have an incredibly good network of real estate locations today and I think that's really important, because it complements the strategy of why we need our stores. And the second is almost half of our stores are up for renewal. We do a relatively short term leases with our team. And so we have the ability to be super flexible to move with speed, depending on what we see, will be like, at any given time in the market as well. Jonathan Matuszewski : It's really helpful. Thanks for the color. Corie Barry : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Hey, everyone. Good morning. I'm going to ask one question with two parts, related to store sales sort of coming back here. Can you just tell us if store sales are coming back, what you're seeing in terms of service attach rate, warranty attach rate? And then the mid-30s e-commerce mix, now that it's a little bit lower from your initial expectation. What, if anything, is that doing to your EBIT margin forecast for the year? Did that help in any way? Matthew Bilunas : Yeah. Thank you for the question, Simeon. Overarchingly, as we see the store's sales rebound a bit from last year, we are seeing strong attach rates, pretty normal historical level attach rates with our stores and as we've talked about in the past as e-commerce is a growing business. We're seeing continued improvement on e-commerce attach as well. So we're seeing good utilization. We're selling a lot of television appliances and so the installation delivery is quite high, that we've been talking about. So, things are returning to back to normal if you will, and obviously, there's a lot of need to support people in their homes, as they're living in a very hybrid way right now. So, we're seeing a good return to our services business. From an e-com mix and what that does to the EBIT range, clearly, if you look at the implied math this year from our new guide, it does imply that, even though our e-com mix is a bit lower than we estimated in starting the year that the implied math is that our OI rates are actually a little stronger than they would have been at the start of the year. So, even though we're mixing a little bit out of e-com, we are still seeing good leverage on our sales, despite the fact we are shifting back a bit more into store sales. Simeon Gutman : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scott Ciccarelli : Hi, guys. It's Scott Ciccarelli. You mentioned supply chain efficiencies. But we do continue to hear about product shortages. We have whole categories like automobiles and appliances facing pretty significant shortages. But your inventories, at least from the outside, look like they are in pretty good shape. So can you provide any more color regarding your inventory flow? Are you facing any supply shortages at this point? And how do you think that will evolve in the back half? Thanks. Corie Barry : Yeah, Scott. Thanks for the question. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have definitely said that we've seen at least some spotty inventory shortages. And so obviously, to your point, the team has done an amazing job navigating an environment where they can drive a 37% comp. And our days of supply have been improving throughout the quarter, and we think they'll continue to improve into Q2. But given the unprecedented demand and some of the production disruptions, we have seen constraints, particularly in appliances, computing, TVs. And then we've talked about gaming, obviously, which has been a bit spotty. We're seeing some of that disruption driven by really four things. You've got raw materials and production capacity. You've got the very well-documented chip shortages. You've got port and container constraints and delays. And then ultimately, over all of that is this kind of sustained unprecedented, truly global demand in our space. And I think what's interesting about our business is we have a high degree of transferability. Meaning because we are a special PCE player, especially if you come into the store, but I would argue in our digital properties, we can help you navigate what exactly you are looking for, and then what are the variety of products that might meet your needs. So if you come in for a certain SKU, Scott, as an example, we'll have an associate there who might say, we don't have that one, but here is another SKU that will meet your same needs, same size TV, same spec, that kind of thing. And so I think that helps us navigate this inventory situation in a way that's a little bit different than others. And like I said, I think we're going to continue we believe, to see some level of inventory constraints likely in pockets throughout the rest of the year, assuming that you kind of continue to see the sustained level of demand. But I'm very proud and impress the way the team is navigating through it. And then the last thing I would say before we got is, our inventory is also in the best situation, I see that in terms of at [ph] risk. It's very clean inventory. Much of it is new. It's turning really fast, like Matt said. So it's actually some of the highest inventory quality we've ever seen. Scott Ciccarelli : Super helpful. Thank you. Corie Barry : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Baker with D.A. Davidson. Michael Baker : Hey, guys. I wanted to ask about the SG&A increase. So you said 225 to 275 in incentive comp increase year-over-year, I think it was an incentive comp. What was the increase in the previous guidance? Because it seems like most of the increase in the SG&A comes from the higher incentive comp. So I guess if you could help us with some numbers there, and then confirm if that's the biggest reason for the increase and what else might be in the increase in SG&A dollars versus the previous guidance? Thank you. Matthew Bilunas : Yeah. Thank you for the question. In the previous guidance, essentially, short term incentive was assumed to be flat for the year, as we looked through the first quarter and our performance. And again, look outwards towards the end of the year, that performance clearly increased. And so that 225 to 275 is really the increased expectations on the full year business, and our original asset was basically flat on a year-over-year basis. So the other elements of SG&A from a guide perspective, it's pretty consistent. We know that we're going to continue developing technology or continue to invest in technology and health, and that's about $150 million. That's still in our guide for the year. And then, as well, we do know that there's about $100 million of COVID-related decisions we made last year that we have to lap this year. And that's inclusive of the $40 million contribution to the foundation, we made in Q3. So those are consistent. The biggest increase is really around that incentive compensation adjustment. Michael Baker : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. I appreciate the color. Matthew Bilunas : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. Good morning. It's Seth Basham. My question is around the computing category. You continue to see strength there, little bit some product shortages. But as you think about the prospects for that category going forward, against really strong sales last year, probably doing work from home and school from home phenomenon, do you expect to see a meaningful drag on your sales results from that category? Michael Mohan : Hey, Seth. Its Mike. I'll start, and Corie and Matt can chime in. Computing has been a phenomenal sales success story in the industry and for Best Buy. And I think the position that we created look for consumers and then, you know, for some of our direct-to-business segments as well driving our good results. I think the category is also going to be constraint and we have talk a little bit about our inventory. And we feel we have enough inventories to meet the demands, and inventory is getting better. We're going to have a - maybe more normal back-to-school selling season as kind of things normalize. In an environment where the inventory remains relatively tight, and some of the form factors are changing quickly. We moved from things needed to be ultra portable and very productivity driven to things that need bigger screens, for example. And that means new product revs, when we see new product revs, we usually see less proportionality. So overall, I think you guys know that computing does have a lower profit rate than some of the other businesses at Best Buy, but the actual revenue contribution and then actual EBIT flow through is really attractively we like it. And I don't know if Corie or Matt, you might have anything else to add here. Corie Barry : No. I would just underscore. I think we are seeing a huge refresh right now as Mike said, and it's still not done. And demand for PC gaming and crypto and graphics cards remains really high as well. So it's a broad category, when we talk about it. And so I think you are still going to see a population that likely is going to be living some hybrid [ph] life for the foreseeable future and I think the refresh cycle as a result are going to continue to speed up as people look forward that new and better way for them to work-from-home, school-from-home and continue actually the stream-from-home in some cases. So yeah, obviously it's been six quarters of positive comp growth, but we continue to see a real demand for the continued innovation of the products. Seth Basham : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle : Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. So maybe I was hoping we can maybe contextualize the comp guidance a little bit. So you guys just put up in certainly good 1Q number, 2Q looks great, took up your guidance by a lot obviously. But in terms of kind of what's implied for the rest of the year, I don't think that there's been much of a change and. Or put another way, it implies a pretty significant deceleration. I guess, the holidays didn\u2019t come and we don't know where spending is going to go. But at least today if we sort of look at the data, in markets that have opened up and travel is coming back. That doesn't look to me like, you're seeing a pullback in home or see or anything else. So I guess, just any more \u2013 anything more you could say in terms of framing that and how conservative or not maybe do you think your guidance for the year is? Matthew Bilunas : Sure. Thank you. And I can start and then Corie could jump in if she wants there. I think fundamentally, we believe, just starting with the rural technology and people's lives has only intensified. And so essentially, what we've done is we took our Q1 beat and then increased our cost [ph] expectations for Q2. And we really left the back half unchanged at this point because there's still a lot of uncertainty. We are seeing customers shop in the service category areas now in addition to ours. We're still seeing some strength even though people are returning to more normalized shopping behavior. But we also are thoughtful about the fact that stimulus will probably have a less event impact as we get into the back half of the year. And so those are some of the bigger things in our mind. I think we do believe that the hybrid work model will continue. So there could be some continued opportunity there as well. As you look at the back half, the personal saving rate is very high and people's financial credit stability is very strong. And again, there could be some additional child tax credits coming in earlier - this back half of the year. And then in addition, we have - we continue to be optimistic about innovation and how continued relationships with partners like T-Mobile will help our business. But there's still a lot of uncertainty in terms of what the back half will hold in terms of the customer shopping trends. And also, we just still are wary of inventory availability. We have a lot of inventory. We can still support a high level of sales with constraints, but there is a very high demand that we have to be thoughtful about as well. So that's essentially the thoughts that went into the EBIT guide. Curtis Nagle : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : Thanks so much for squeezing me in. Pretty simple question, if I look at your 2 year stack comp, it's up almost 32%. Just wondering when the last time that Best Buy did a 32% 2 year stack comp? Thanks. Corie Barry : I think before our recorded history. Thanks for the question, Anthony. Anthony Chukumba : No problem. Keep up the good work. Corie Barry : Thank you. And with that, I think that's our last question. Thank you so much for joining us today. And I hope that many of our investors listening today are able to join us at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which will be held virtually on June 16. Thanks so much, and have a great day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Later we will conduct a question and answer session. At that time, [Operator instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 A.M. Eastern Time today. If you need assistance on the call at any time, [Operator Instructions] and the Operator will assist you. I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations, please go ahead. Mollie O\u2019Brien: Thank you and good morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO, and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful, can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors. bestbuy.com.  Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments, and expected performance of the Company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the Company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q2 financial results of $11.8 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98. Comparable sales growth was 20% and our non-GAAP operating income growth was 40%. We are lapping an unusual quarter last year, as our stores were limited to curbside service or in-store appointments for roughly half the quarter. When we compare to two years ago, our results are very strong. Compared to the second quarter of Fiscal '20 revenue is up 24% and our non - GAAP operating income is up 115%. Clearly, customer demand for technology products and services during the quarter remains very strong. Customers continue to leverage technology to meet their needs. And we provided solutions that help them work, learn, entertain, cook and connect at home. The demand was also bolstered by an overall strong consumer spending aided by government stimulus, improving wages, and high savings levels.  From a merchandising perspective, we saw a strong comparable sales growth in almost all categories. The biggest contributors to the sales growth in the quarter were home theater, appliances, computing, mobile phones, and services. Product availability improved in the quarter, and except for some pockets in appliances and home theater, we do not believe it materially limited our overall sales growth. Our merchant, demand planning, and supply chain teams once again did an amazing job managing through the difficult and constantly evolving supply-chain environment.  They worked strategically to bring in as much inventory as possible during the quarter, with actions like acquiring additional transportation, pulling up product flow, and adjusting store assortment based on availability. There will continue to be challenges, particularly as it relates to congested ports and transportation disruptions, but our teams have set us up for as strong an inventory position as possible as we move forward into the back half of the year. As we think about the holiday period, we often have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges, and this year will be no different. But we feel confident in our ability to serve our customers during the holiday. But continued strong demand across retail resulted in an overall less promotional environment, which was a significant driver of our better-than-expected profitability in the quarter. During the quarter, we provided customers multiple ways to interact with us depending on their needs, preference, and comfort. Similar to last quarter, customers migrated back into stores to touch and feel products and to seek in-person expertise and service. At the same time, they continue to interact with us digitally at a significantly higher rate than pre-pandemic as online sales were 32% of domestic revenues compared to 16% in Q2 of fiscal '20. Phone and chat volume also remained very high compared to pre-pandemic and sales via these channels continue to decline. In addition, of course, we are interacting with customers in their homes, making large product deliveries, selling solutions, repairing products, and providing sales consultations. In fact, overall, we are helping our customers with their technology needs in their homes, 20% more than we did 2 years ago in Q2 of Fiscal '20. Through all of these interactions, across all of these touchpoints, 98% of survey customers tell us they feel very safe, which we believe is still incredibly important at this stage in the pandemic. I want to genuinely thank our store and in-home teams, for creating this safe environment for our customers. And for continuing to provide exceptional service, even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines, and in some cases were disrespectful. For customers purchasing online, we delivered products with speed and convenience. Online sales package delivery was not only much faster than last year, it was faster than 2 years ago. Furthermore, we stack up extremely well versus our competition. Using a third-party service, we analyze competitor websites on a daily basis, and we consistently lead in the proportion of one day or less for published shipping time across a sample of higher volume zip codes, and higher demand items. In addition, we leveraged our stores to drive fast and convenient fulfillment of online orders. In Q2, we continue to see about 60% of our online revenue fulfilled by stores, including in-store or curbside pickup, ship from store, or Best Buy employees who are delivering the product to customers out of more than 450 of our stores.  The percent of online sales picked up by customers at our stores was 42%, similar to last year's second quarter. Clearly, the landscape as it relates to the pandemic has been changing rapidly and we remain keenly focused on keeping our employees and customers safe. We are continuing to encourage all employees to get COVID vaccinations by providing them with paid time off when they receive the vaccine and providing them absence time to be used in the event they develop side effects. In June, we launched an employee sweepstake with more than $100,000 in cash prizes to encourage our team members to get vaccinated.  To show our appreciation for their hard work and ongoing efforts in the face of pandemic fatigue, we paid employee gratitude bonuses at the beginning of the quarter. In summary, our team has delivered incredible results. To all of our associates across the Company, I thank you for your customer obsession, perseverance, and ingenuity. Of course, while we were driving these great Q2 results, we were also looking to the future. During the quarter, we continued to roll out and run several tests and pilots as we determine the best path forward to become an even more customer-centric, digitally focused, and efficient Company.  We believe this is crucial to thriving in a new and different environment where customers expect to seamlessly interact with physical and digital channels throughout the shopping journey as they seek inspiration, research, convenience, and support. Last year we introduced a very important membership pilot called Best Buy Beta. As a reminder, it includes unlimited Geek Squad technical support on all of the technology in your home no matter where or when you purchased it, including 24/7 VIP access to dedicated phone and chat teams, that are only available to members. It also includes up to 24 months of product protection on most purchases from Best Buy, free delivery and standard installation, exclusive member pricing, a 60-day extended return window, and free shipping of online orders. All for $199 per year. The offer is designed to give our customers the confidence that whatever their technology needs are, we will be there to help. It leverages our unique strengths and what we can provide customers that no one else can. The goal is to create a membership experience that customers will love, which in turn results in a higher customer lifetime value and drives the larger share of CE to spend to Best Buy. We are very excited about this membership offer and we are encouraged by the pilot results. Membership acquisition has exceeded our initial forecast. In addition, data is showing that Beta members interact more frequently and have a higher incremental spend than non-members.  Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics and our members are skewing younger than our Total Tech Support Membership Program. In addition, our employees love telling customers about the program. We plan to scale the program nationally, in stores and online, at the end of Q3 under the new name Best Buy Total Tech. As part of the national rollout, we will be converting our 3.1 million existing Total Tech Support members to the new program. I want to stress that the goal of the program is for customers to find value in the benefits and use them often.  It is not designed to be a standalone margin-driving service offering, particularly in the near term. In fact, as Matt will discuss later, a full rollout is a near-term investment, which we are confident will be justified with incremental sales growth and long-term customer value. As it relates to our physical stores and operating model, we are continuing to pilot and test many approaches and formats. Specifically, we test how we can leverage our stores and facilities for more fulfillment purposes, and how we can deliver customer [Indiscernible] supported and engaged workforce. We are not going to outline all of our initiatives today, but I would like to provide a few updates on learning. We have begun implementing the pilot of our new holistic market approach in Charlotte. As we mentioned last quarter, this pilot is designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, outlet, lockers, our digital app, and both in-store. We will be testing and arranging remodeling a number of stores to 15, 25, and 35,000 square foot stores, as well as launching a few [Indiscernible] foot stores. We expect the full rollout of the pilot to span a few quarters either way, including the transition of one store into a new type of outlet. Our current fits large appliance and TV open box product. With this new outlet pilot, we will have open box products from all categories. It will also serve as the hub in a new services repair hub and spoke model we are testing, as well as an auto tech mega [Indiscernible] Of course, the reason we are piloting and testing so much is because we are trying some new unique prototypes, and we need the opportunity to learn and adjust before we roll more broadly. For Minneapolis test stores, were [Indiscernible] to 15,000 square feet to provide more space for fulfillment. We have been making adjustments based on customer and employee feedback. We've reflowed some of the layouts, added signage to help customers understand the changes we are testing, and added assortments in areas like small appliances, printing, and accessories. We will continue to evolve feedback as it relates to 5,000 square foot store pilot. We continue to receive positive feedback from customers and employees on store design and the way we are showcasing products. In addition, year to date, this store generated higher revenue than controlled stores in the double-digit percent range. Another pilot that we are excited to launch pre-holiday is our virtual store. For this, [Indiscernible] in one of our distribution centers that will have merchandising and products, and will be staffed by dedicated associates, including vendor [Indiscernible], but it will have no physical customers. Instead, customers can interact with our experts via chat, audio, video, and screen sharing, depending on their preference, and be able to see live demos, displays, and physical products. We are excited about the customers. For example, you could be on our dot.com experience, click on a product you like, and be connected via video, to a blue shirt in the Best Buy virtual store, and never leave your living room. Or you could be standing in a store, scan a bar code, and be taken through your phone directly to this virtual store where an associate could answer your question.  From a fulfillment perspective we piloted last year, we're very successful, and we're continuing to iterate on the model. As a reminder, while all stores will continue to ship online orders, we are driving efficiency and effectiveness by consolidating ship from store units in a limited number of stores across the country. As we evolve the model overall, we are using fewer stores than last year as hubs. In addition, we have begun remodeling a subset of stores to deliver an even greater portion of the volume, reducing the sales floor square [Indiscernible], packaging, station equipment, and supplies. These 13 locations should be rolled out by holiday and take on about 25% of the national ship-from-store volume. As you would expect, the various tests and pilots are intended to identify how our store portfolio should evolve from the role-based serve to their [Indiscernible] these tests we will develop plans that likely include a rollout of investments in more stores and markets. We have also been evolving our labor model to meet our customer's changing shopping behaviors. For our employees, we are designing for more choice, flexibility, and career opportunity.  We continue to see momentum with our flexible workforce initiative, which is centered on store employees' expertise to perform roles outside of their primary job function. At the end of July, 80% of our associates [Indiscernible] into different work zones, and 50% of associates have earned four or more jobs. This allows our employees and us to [Indiscernible] in the store and between channels, phone, remote support, or employee product delivery. And very soon we will be able to schedule associates between stores within a market. This flexibility is important for all of our stores going forward, but even more important for our smaller stores with less labor.  This new way of working empowers [Indiscernible] giving them opportunities to learn new skills, broaden their experience jobs. They are equipped to confidently help customers in more ways, and our data is showing us that once employees add skills, they tend to drive a higher customer NPS. It also gets team members the ability to earn a different hourly wage depending on the job performed and the potential for working additional shifts that otherwise may not have been available in their primary job function. We believe our flexible workforce initiatives can add to our ability to attract and retain our employees, particularly in this tight labor market.  And in addition to the training and flexibility we offer, we have also invested significantly in compensation and benefits for our associates. On top of raising our starting wage to $15 last year, we provide a wide array of competitive benefits across many dimensions, including tuition reimbursement, employee product discounts, paid time off for part-time associates, back-up child care, child tutor reimbursement, and many others. Overall, we are operating with a smaller field workforce than we were pre-pandemic, which is very reflective of how the business model has changed. As our online revenue has more than doubled from two years ago, we feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model, the demand we are seeing, and the nature of our customer interaction.  What is most important right now is to continue to learn and iterate. As you can imagine, having a more flexible workforce is a very important component of our operating with a smaller workforce. And technology is crucial to its success as well. In fact, technology is the underpinning to the success of our Company strategy. We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate. This fact has been clearly reinforced by all of our pilots. There is a myriad of technology projects in development, but here are just a few examples. We will leverage the electronics sign labels in our stores to make it simpler and more seamless for customers to shop. Especially in our stores with smaller shopping square footage. Specifically, we are adding messaging to the labels that mimic our Dot.Com experience. In other words, customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store, or in another store nearby. And when it could be delivered and installed. We are also piloting mobile app checkout so that customers, particularly grab-and-go customers, can quickly check out, without needing to interact with an associate. For our virtual store to really come to life seamlessly for our customers, we are building out a new digital communication platform, that will combine multiple systems into one experience for a call, chat, video, and screen sharing.  We put our customers in control of how and when they want to be served across these vehicles. Of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities, like data and analytics, and broader cloud migration, in order to drive scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. Earlier this month, Fast Company named us to its 2021 list of the 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators. This is our first time on the list, which recognizes companies that created cultures of innovation despite the challenges posed by the pandemic. During the quarter, we continued to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, in the past year, across fitness and wearables, wellness and health, we have more than doubled our vendor partners and grew our SKU count by more than 150%.  These include [Indiscernible], specifically those focused on conditional health management that helps customers track blood glucose levels, keep tabs on heart data, manage weight, or even help identify allergens in food. Furthermore, we are working with hospitals and care centers to cure-rate health products for their patients on co-branded landing pages. Because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we are also expanding to additional adjacent categories. For example, we have expanded our assortment in categories like outdoor living as more and more consumers look to makeover or upgrade their outdoor spaces. This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits, and electric mowers, to name a few.  Many of these products are available online only as part of our digital-first strategy. All together, they are a small part of our overall business but growing fast as we continue to add to the assortment. In the back half of the year, we expect to add more products in the fitness, beauty, sleep, pain management, vision, hearing, and electric transportation categories. Before I conclude my prepared ongoing commitment to inclusion and diversity and our community. During the second quarter, we announced our commitment to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses, by 2025.  This pledge includes plans to increase all forms of spending with black, indigenous, and people of color businesses, from nearly every corner of the Company. From how we bring goods and services to stores, to where and how we advertise. The goal is to create a stronger community of diverse suppliers and to help increase BIPOC representation in the tech industry. In addition, earlier this month, we announced we are investing up to $10 million with brown venture group, a venture capital firm that focuses exclusively on black, Latino, and indigenous technology startups.  The goal of this investment is to help break down the systemic barriers often faced by BIPOC, entrepreneurs, including lack of access to funding, and empowering the next tech generation. To make a difference in our local communities, we are passionate about building out our Teen Tech Center program. These provide teens in disinvested communities access to the training, tools, and mentorship needed to succeed in post-secondary opportunities and careers. We are also building a diverse talent pipeline for jobs of the future. During the second quarter, we launched our first-ever opportunity for customers to donate to the Best Buy Foundation in support of teen tech centers. Between July 11th and September 11th, customers can choose to donate when they make a purchase, including at a Best Buy store, bestbuy.com, or the Best Buy app. We also just published our 16th annual ESG report, which outlines how we are working across the Company to have a positive impact on our planet, employees, customers, and communities. In terms of the environment, this past year, we exceeded our goal to reduce carbon emissions in our operations by 60% through investments in renewable energy and operational improvements. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions by 75% by 2030. And we signed the climate pledge committed to being carbon-neutral by 2040, a decade faster than our previous goal of 2050.  We also have a robust trade-in program that brings a useful second life to products that might otherwise sit idle in someone's home or end up in a landfill. For products that need to be recycled, we continue to operate the most comprehensive consumer electronics and appliances take-back program in the U.S., taking back more than 2 billion pounds since 2009. Available on our corporate website, our ESG report also outlines the ways we support our employees and communities. In summary, we have delivered a remarkable first half against a volatile backdrop. I am so proud of the execution of our teams as they continue to safely meet the needs of our customers in ways that I would argue no one else can.  Based on the strength of the business and our expectations for continued customer demand, we are raising our sales outlook for the back half. Of course, the environment as it relates to the pandemic is still rapidly evolving and there is uncertainty as to the associated impact on many important factors, including consumer shopping behavior, the share of wallet on services, like dining and travel, return to the office and return-to-school. Furthermore, we continue to believe the holiday season will remain unique against that backdrop. That being said, our teams have proven they can and will continue to proactively navigate these factors. And they remain ready to respond and adjust the business as the environment potentially changes. Over the longer term, we are fundamentally in a stronger position than we expected to be just two years ago. There has been a dramatic and structural increase in the need for technology. And we now serve a much larger install-base of consumer electronics with customers who have an elevated appetite to upgrade due to constant technology innovation and needs that reflect permanent life changes, like hybrid work and streaming entertainment content.  This is only underscored by the recent Senate passage of the Infrastructure Bill, which will provide even more access to broadband and give us the opportunity to serve the needs of currently under-served communities. Our unique omnichannel assets, including our ability to inspire what is possible across the breadth of CE products, as well as our ability to keep it all working together with the way customers want, truly differentiate us going forward in this new landscape. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Matt, for details on our results and insights on our outlook for the next quarter and the full year. Matt Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting very strong financial results as the demand for the products and services we provide remained high during the quarter. An enterprise revenue of $11.8 billion, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.98, an increase of 74% versus last year. Our non - GAAP operating income rate of 6.9% increased 100 basis points. This rate expansion was driven by an 80 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Despite lapping actions to reduce our SG&A and a spend last year, we were able to leverage our SG&A 20 basis points on the higher sales volume. In addition, a lower effective tax rate had a $0.47 favorable year-over-year impact on our non-GAAP diluted EPS.  As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, our stores were closed to customer traffic for about half the quarter, while we were helping customers through our curbside service and in-store appointments. We also made several cost reduction decisions last year to align with the lower sales and channel trends we were seeing and were expecting to continue at that point. As Corie mentioned, when comparing our results against 2 years ago, or the second quarter of our Fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 24%. Also, our domestic store channel revenue was higher than 2 years ago, despite almost 50 fewer stores, and online revenue growth of almost 150% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue and adjusting our business model to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 290 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from two years ago. Let me now share a few comments on how our Q2 performance compared to the outlook we shared on our last call. Enterprise comparable sale growth of 20% was above our estimate of approximately 17%. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate improved 80 basis points versus last year, compared to our outlook of approximately flat.  As Corie stated, this better-than-expected gross profit rate performance was primarily driven by a more favorable promotional environment. Lastly, non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew 18% compared to last year, which was slightly favorable to our outlook of approximately 20% growth. Let me now share more details specific to our second quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue for the quarter increased 21% to $11 billion. Our comparable sales growth was also 21% for the quarter. In recent quarters, our revenue growth has been lower than our comparable sales growth, due to the loss of revenue from stores that were permanently closed in the past year. Although that was still true this quarter, that impact was partially offset by revenue growth from stores that were closed for remodel as a result of last year's unrest and fall outside of our comparable sales calculations.  As a reminder, our comparable sales calculation includes revenue from all stores that were temporarily closed or operating in our curbside-only operating model during the period. This year, we expect to close approximately 30 U.S. stores compared to roughly 20 closures in each of the last two years. Consistent with our previous practice, we will make every effort to retain the employees from the closing locations. From a monthly cadence perspective, the strongest sales growth was in May. As expected, July's monthly comp was the lowest of the quarter as we lapped the reopening of our stores in June of last year. Turning now to gross profit, the domestic non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 90 basis points to 23.7%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates, rate leverage from our supply chain costs, and higher profit sharing revenue from our private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. Overall, the promotional mix and sales discounts for the full quarter were once again lower than the levels we experienced last year. However, our comparisons are now beginning to lap periods of very low promotional activity last year. In July, the overall promotional activity increased versus last year but was still below the levels we experienced during Fiscal '20. Moving next to SG&A.  Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased 19% compared to last year, and decreased 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As expected, the largest drivers of the expense increase versus last year were the first higher incentive compensation for corporate and field employees of approximately $100 million, which is partially due to the suspension of our short-term incentive program last year.  Second, higher store payroll costs these changes in our operating model last year. And third, the impact of lapping our COVID-related impacts last year, which resulted in higher costs this year, for advertising expense, medical claims expense, and our 401(K) Company match. Lastly, we increased investments this year in support of our technology initiatives. When comparing to 2 years ago, domestic non - GAAP SG&A increased $94 million and decreased 310 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus Fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, technology investments, and increased variable costs due to the higher sales volume. Partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 8.4% versus 23% last year. The lower Q2 fiscal '22 rate was primarily due to a multi-jurisdiction, multi-year, non-cash benefit from the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.3 billion in cash. At the end of Q2, our inventory balance was 55% higher than last year's comparable period and was 23% higher than our Q2 ending inventory balance from two years ago.  The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology, as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance. The health of our inventory remains very strong. Let me next share more color on our outlook for the second half of fiscal '22 in our updated assumptions for the full year. As we entered the year, we expected revenue growth to be positive in the first half of the year and then negative in the back half as we lap the strong comp growth in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '21.  Our original outlook also reflected a scenario in which customers would resume or accelerate spend in areas that were slow during the pandemic, such as travel and dining out. Although we are seeing some shift in consumer spending occur, the impact has been less pronounced than we previously anticipated. We now expect our comparable sales growth to be down 3% to flat to last year in the back half, which is a significant improvement from the high single-digit decline we expected entering the year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand. We continue to be confident in our ability to navigate the ever-changing environment.  For the second half of the year, we expect the non-GAAP gross profit rate to be down approximately 30 basis points to last year, which compares to 60 basis points of expansion in the first half of the year. The primary drivers of the sequential decrease include the impact of rolling out Total Tech, increased promotional activity, and less leverage on our supply chain costs than we experienced in the first half of this year. The gross profit rate pressure of our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer.  This pressure is expected to have a larger impact on our fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Now, I will provide some color specific to our outlook for the third quarter. We expect comparable sales to be in the range of down 3% to down 1% to last year, which is on top of our 23% comparable sales growth in the third quarter of last year. Our revenue growth to start this quarter has been approximately flat to last year for the first three weeks. From a gross profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate.  From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we're planning dollars to be approximately flat compared to last year. As we expect the lapping of last year's $40 million donations to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation to be largely offset by increased technology investments and higher advertising expenses. Turning to our full-year outlook, we expect the following : enterprise revenue in the range of $51 billion to $52 billion, comparable sales growth of 9% to 11%, and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year. For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9%, which compares to the prior outlook of 6% to 7% growth. The increased expense is primarily due to higher store payroll costs and other variable items associated with the higher sales outlook. In addition, we expect the incentive compensation for the full year to increase by approximately $275 million or at the high end of our previously provided range. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million, and lastly, we expect to spend at least $2.5 billion on share purchases.  In closing, over the last two years, our teams have successfully adapted to various changes to our operating model and a dramatic shift in customer shopping behavior. We have seen a surge in reliance in demand for technology as our customers also adapt to their changing needs. The result is that we now expect our sales will surpass $51 billion this year. That is more than $7 billion of increased sales over a two-year period. Thank you, to all our employees for driving these amazing results. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll move on to our first question from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. Steven Forbes : Good morning. I wanted to focus on the pricing and promotional environment. And so maybe I'll just ask my 2 questions together. The first part is, as we think about the price increases that are being passed through here to the consumer, can you provide some context around the magnitude of them and how the industry as a whole is addressing these? Rather -- is everyone passing them through or do you see potential increases in promotional activity? And then the follow-up to that is, as we think about the holiday period, in past years, other competitors utilizing the category to drive traffic during the holiday period. Can you talk about the expectation for holiday as a whole, as it relates to frequency and depth of promotional activity? Thank you. Matt Bilunas : Why don't I start, and then Corie can jump in. I think there's a few questions in there. I -- Overall, what we're seeing was the first half of the year was less promotional, similar to the trends we experienced last year during the pandemic. As we -- as I said in my comments, we are starting to see us lap those periods of very low promotionality.  As in July, we're actually seeing the mix of items on promotion and the discounts associated with promotions are actually higher than last year. So, we're starting to see a bit more return to a promotional level that -- more than last year, but still higher than -- still less promotional than two years ago. And so, we do see that increasing. and over that period of time where promotions have been lower, customers have been essentially paying higher prices because the costs -- we haven't been promoting as much.  And so that's certainly part of the aspect. Also, within pricing, we certainly are seeing a little bit of inflation as well as you look at the prices of goods. In some cases, those are being passed on to consumers. Appliances is an example where there has been increases to the cost of those goods, which the industry is generally passing on. But overall, inflation hasn't been a bigger part of our ASP increases, it's been more on the promotionality versus inflation has been relatively small impacting the first half. It might be a little bit more in the back half, but I wouldn't expect inflation as it relates to pricing to be as significant. Corie Barry : And I would just simply underscore our priority is always to be priced competitively. And that will be the case no matter what's coming through the costing side of things. As we head into holiday, specifically to that part of your question, we said even in the prepared remarks, we would expect the back half to be more promotional, and Matt alluded to July being a little bit of that lead into what we're seeing. And we would expect the products that we sell to be products that people really want for holiday, and therefore, that environment to heat up correspondingly. And so, that is part of what's embedded in the guide going forward. Steven Forbes : Thank you. Best of luck. Corie Barry : Thank you. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : We'll now move onto our next question from Peter Keith of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Peter Keith : Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much. Great results here. I was hoping you could flesh out a little more on the membership program. It seems interesting. I guess, for the same price, it's basically upgraded to Total Tech Support. Can you confirm it's going to be at all stores by year-end? And then, the gross margin pressure you're experiencing, is that something that will be ongoing or is it more of an annualized effect the program gets ramped up? Corie Barry : Thank you, Peter. I'll start, and then Matt can talk a little bit about financial ramifications. So, what was important to us in beta, was understanding; how can we build on some of what we're learning in Total Tech Support in terms of what our customers love, but add onto that what we think will continue to provide them value over time. Like many membership programs are just continuing to evolve based on what we're learning distinctly from our customers.  And so, we started testing data actually just at the very beginning of this fiscal year. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we're definitely seeing uptake that is greater than both what we expected, greater than what we were seeing in Total Tech support, and I think it's the combination of features that we talked about in the prepared remarks, that are making our customers come to us more frequently.  And like we also said, spend a bit more each time that they're coming to see us because you have this combination that keeps customers very sticky to the Best Buy brand. And so, this is really an evolution of what we have learned in Total Tech Support. Started testing in the very beginning of this year and then we plan to actually roll out towards the end of Q3.  So it will be in place, like Matt said, and have a bigger impact for Q4. But the key for us is that we expect the membership to grow faster than what we saw in TTS. And we've seen that play out in the pilot, and we're going to keep iterating on the offers, frankly, depending on what it is that customers really value and what it is that keeps them loving our brand and very loyal to the brand. I'll let Matt talk a little bit about the financial implications. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Thanks for the question, Peter. Essentially, as you would imagine, the Total Tech offer is just far more inclusive to of -- to the benefits to our customers. And so, with that, you're seeing more costs associated with Total Tech. It just has more enhanced benefits than what we had offering in TTS. And that is essentially driving the gross margin profit -- gross margin impact in the back half of this year. The intent of Total Tech is not to actually drive margin rate. The intent of Total Tech is for us to increase sales and therefore leverage more sales into the future. So, the short-term impact certainly is going to be a gross profit rate impact. As you look forward, the intent is for not to be gross profit accretive because what we want people to do is to use it more.  That usage will create more sales and create more leverage on our bottom line in the future. And that's the overall take, but as you would imagine, the enhanced spend do come with more cost, but we believe that will keep people secure and coming back and increase our share at wall with them. Peter Keith : Okay. Sounds great. Thanks for the feedback. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Michael Lasser of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Do the guidance now include the expectations that your comps could be flatten down in the second half of this year versus last year? You've previously assumed that it could be more down-high single-digits. It sounds like the difference being that consumers have yet to really shift their wallet to the categories that you expected, do you think this reflects some permanent change in behavior or it's going to happen, it's just that it's not going to happen in the second half of the year and it's going to be more like a 2022 event?  And can you also give us an indication how you factored in any sort of composition of your inventory in the back half, meaning, while up significantly overall, are there any areas where you might be a little short on inventory that will lead to some out of stocks when you factor that into the flat down 2%? Corie Barry : So, I will start particularly on the wallet shift question. We noted in the prepared remarks that we definitely are seeing that shift happen slower than what we thought. And it's less than a shift, it's actually been -- for a while, we're seeing growth in both sides. And as Matt said, as the pandemic has redoubled its efforts, we've seen it shifting away a little bit from some of the experiences, that we've just seen this growth continue honestly, in both experiences and on the retail side. I think we're pragmatic and we've said in the prepared remarks, we believe at some point that shift will continue to happen. I think it is being pushed out a bit.  But importantly, there are also systemic changes that have happened in the way that all of us live, right? If you think about something like hybrid work models, that's not just something that's going to happen in the back half or in a quarter. That is likely a new way of working going forward, or streaming, and the amount of streaming content. That's not just in the moment change, that is a change in how people will consume content going forward. And so, I think honestly you have a little bit of both sides here. You have real systemic changes that have happened in the way that we live. And there's, I think, a push out in people really shifting hard that spending to experiences. And then part of that is being how healthy the consumer is in terms of, still, savings rates that are at all-time highs and very healthy balance sheets, access to credit, and all of those fundamentals staying really solid, I think is helping buoy this demand across both experiences and retail. Matt Bilunas : Yes, I'll just add a little bit. Corie did a great job explaining the consumer side of that. I think, overall, as you talked about, we are now expecting flat to down 3% in the back half, and that's much better than we had expected at the end of last quarter, which was more closer to down approximately 8%. I think one of the things I would add to that situation is inventory. We feel like we're in a good spot as we look to the back half of this year. I think you asked about inventory.  We are still seeing pockets of inventory, but quite honestly, we are really healthy, strong position, and are preparing ourselves very well for the holiday season. So that clearly adds to our optimism to the back half as well. They are also a lot of uncertainties as you look at it, but we'll update people as we go. Michael Lasser : And my follow-up question is on the promotional environment and gross margins. You've mentioned that July, you saw promotions higher than they were in 2020, but still down from where they were in 2019, so how do you factor in your gross margin expectations for the next couple of quarters, where the promotional environment's going to be.  Will it still be higher than or below 2019? And under what conditions could you see some of the other players in the space as it become more promotional than they were in 2019, especially if sales really start to slow at a greater rate than you're expecting? Matt Bilunas : Yes, I think overall we're always going to be very aware of what our competitors are doing in the back half, whether it's back-to-school or the holiday season, so we'll always be prepared to adjust as appropriately. We are very thoughtful about how we compete and where we compete, in being thoughtful managers of the P&L, if you will.  But overall, I would say, the promotionality we would say probably a little bit higher than what we experienced last year or fiscal '21, but still less promotional than we saw in fiscal '20 starting right now. Again, we'll look at that and manage it as it comes and as we see the holiday unfolds a little bit. But because we were fundamentally always be competitive, but I think, generally, will be more promotional than last year, probably less promotional than two years ago. Michael Lasser : Thank you, very much and good luck. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : And now we will take our next question from Karen Short of Barclays, please go ahead. Your line is open. Karen Short : Hi, thanks very much. Just a couple of questions to clarify. First of all, on the gross margin. So, it's fair to say that, with respect to the roll out of Best Buy Total Tech, that that will pressure gross margins from Q1 through Q3 of next year. That's just a clarification. And then my bigger picture question was, when you think about the overall higher installed base of consumer electronics since this pandemic began.  Wondering if you could give a little color on how you actually see the acceleration in the innovation cycle playing out, meaning obviously we'll have shorter and shorter life cycles leading to need to upgrade more frequently, but I'm wondering if you could just contextualize that a little bit. Matt Bilunas : Thanks for the question, Karen. Yes, I will start and then Corie can jump in on the last part of the question. We're not ready to guide next year yet, but so certainly we are expecting Total Tech to pressure Q3 of this year and Q4 of this year as we roll it out. As you can appreciate, we're still trying to understand usage at a roll out level.  And so, it's a little early for us to talk about where -- how long that pressure will exist and in what line of the P&L. As I said, the goal is for it not to actually be accretive to margins. It's supposed to be used, and with that usage will come more costs, but overall, we do expect it to grow our sales over a long term and increase our improve our experiences. It's a bit early to tell how that impacts for next year, but we'll obviously update people as we learn more. Corie Barry : On the question of install bases, it's my favorite question, we definitely are seeing more penetration of goods because people have consumer electronics from multiple locations, and use cases, in their lives. In a hybrid work model, I might have one setup at home. I might have one setup and [Indiscernible] go. And so, you've seen this deeper penetration then, of people's homes and lives.  What's interesting about that is what you hit on in terms of innovation, [Indiscernible] companies that have both benefited from that deeper penetration in yield to innovate in a way that will inspire customers to replace replacement cycles condensing that are coming online that are really useful to people.  I mean, if you think about the evolution of just cameras in computers over the last year because so many people are using video, now you've got cameras that track you, even [Indiscernible] going to be this constant drive features and attributes that you add to [Indiscernible].  And really what's fascinating is based on survey data that we're looking at right now, intent to purchase still remains very high in the next 12-month window, which to us says, you've got people who already are trying to think about what might be the more upgrade that's going to help me live at home schooling or another extended period of working from home. While these are really difficult numbers to [Indiscernible], we are for sure seeing [Indiscernible] looking for those new attributes. And then importantly, vendor partners who are really working harder to create that next suite of solutions that will [Indiscernible] really fundamental structural changes in how we're living our lives. Karen Short : Great, thanks. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : We now move on to our next question from Brad Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brad Thomas : Hi, good morning. Great quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you think about categories. I see in 2Q very strong results on a 1 and 2-year basis across the board. With comps having slowed to be declining in the [Indiscernible] that are going to be strongest in weakness. Thank you. Matt Bilunas : I think there's a lot of categories that will continue [Indiscernible] be upon the levels of inventory that we receive. Appliances has been a category, both large and small, have been growing for years at a time. So, we just see more opportunities there. Clearly, a home theater has opportunities as it always does in the back of the holiday season.  So those are some of the bigger ones. I think computing might be an area where it might be a little bit -- it might be slower based add over the last several years going back, but there are a number of categories that will continue to grow. Corie Barry : New category and new product introductions. Both the new categories that we talked about that we're expanding into. While not as big, definitely as likely some new product launches stimulate back to the question about constant innovation that always stimulate a little bit of demand as well. Brad Thomas : Great, and Corie, if you could tell us a bit -- a longer-term [Indiscernible] Corie Barry : Technology. The second area is all about emergency response device-based tools back in our homes. And that builds on some of acquisitions that we've already seen. Then the third, which is a little bit more nascent is [Indiscernible] digital health caring center services that can connect patients and physicians to enable [Indiscernible].  That one is the most nascent, and that one will take the longest to develop. On the first two, you can hear even our prepared remarks, the unmet, proliferating right now to help people manage their our own care is absolutely incredible, and so on the consumer side, we feel really strong [Indiscernible] dependency that business rebound, especially as we're starting to see more people come back into our stores, and I think the assets as you think about virtual carriers, we've all gone through.  And that [Indiscernible] person hospital does it, but instead be able [Indiscernible] I think, obviously, there's an even greater use case now than there was [Indiscernible] that together, I think broadly we remain really optimistic about how the future of healthcare can be changed through technology and the role that we can play in it it. Brad Thomas : Really helpful. Thank you so much. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : We'll now move onto our next question from Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Mushkin : My question is, I had to get my arms a little bit better around that for [Indiscernible] it looked like from an inventory perspective, from a margin perspective, it just seems in the fourth quarter there is always a challenge, but I was wondering if you'd give us a little bit more what you're thinking there. [Indiscernible] question as well. And I'll start that later. Matt Bilunas : Yeah, thanks. We've jump on the last part there. I think we're very confident that we're [Indiscernible] demand of our customers. There's always a level of constrained inventory when you are still seeing pockets of constrained now. We are in a very health -- more in certain areas, but we have a high degree as we've talked about, transfer ability between categories and within category assortment to meet customers' demand.  I think, overall, from a gross profit perspective, one of the -- we did talk about how we expect to see gross profit rate pressure in Q4. The total picture, we will see probably more return to more promotionality compared to last year, but again, overall, compared to two years ago, it should be less. But again, we'll watch and see where it goes and adjust accordingly. Scott Mushkin : Great, I appreciate the color. And then my second question is what you guys talked about with the whole, again, just looking for a little bit more detail. Are you guys going to be remodeling on there, when we will it be complete? Any more details around that. That sounds very exciting. Corie Barry : Yeah. I am [Indiscernible] because I think it uniquely [Indiscernible] across both our physical assets, our stores, seeing every single store, there will be a number of remodels, but it's not every single one, but it also [Indiscernible] our consultants and designers and advisors in our stores, and leverage them across not just conventional storefronts, but also in places like an outlet, or in places like an auto [Indiscernible] or ten auto base, where you can work on all the cars together as an example.  And we said in the [Indiscernible] role everything out in the market, all the model changes that go with that as you learn how to more flexibly operate all of these models. But the goal for us is balancing that -- this isn't just about like quantity of stores, this is [Indiscernible] to do for you, and then the operating model and the people flexibly working around that physical footprint in a way that uniquely provides [Indiscernible] customers both that inspiration and [Indiscernible] no one else can.  And so, I [Indiscernible] on one concept, but trying to put all the concepts together and say if I want to serve a market, how I help a customer navigate different Best Buy experiences, and also help our employees work more flexibly across all those experiences. With -- Scott Mushkin : -- guys on the incredible job, given what's been thrown at you, so -- next work. Corie Barry : Thank you very much. Scott Mushkin : Thank you. Corie Barry : So, I just want to close by saying, thank you [Indiscernible] being associates and thank you all so much for joining us today. [Indiscernible] our progress during our next call coming up in November. Have a great day",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Best Buy's Q3 FY 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 A.M. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien: Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting record Q3 financial results of $11.9 billion in sales and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08, which is up 1% over last year and up 84% compared to 2 years ago. Against a still evolving backdrop, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating, and our employees continue to do amazing things to support our customer's technology needs and knowledgeable, fast and convenient ways. Our omnichannel capabilities and our ability to inspire and support across all of technology in a way no one else can means we are uniquely positioned to seize the opportunity in this environment and in the future. We continue to capitalize on strong customer demand as more people sustainably work, entertain, cook and connect at home. And Domestic comparable sales growth was up 2% on top of 23% last year. From a merchandising perspective, the biggest contributors to our comparable sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater and mobile phones. Product availability continued to improve throughout quarter. We have pockets of constraints in areas like appliances, gaming and mobile phones. Similar to last quarter, however, we do not believe this materially limited our overall sales growth. While we have faced and continue to face supply chain challenges, including delays and higher costs, we are proactively navigating a situation that we have been dealing with for several quarters, as our industry has been facing disruptions and supply constraints since early in the pandemic. Our merchant demand planning and supply chain teams made strategic sourcing and inventory decisions early in the year to set us up well heading into holiday. And we are resourcefully adapting to the constantly evolving environment with actions like pulling up product flow, adjusting store assortment based on availability and acquiring additional alternative transportation. We have deep, long-standing relationships with our transportation and logistics vendors, and they have been incredibly supportive as we navigate. In addition, through our close partnerships with our product vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. We have varying degrees of inventory and supply chain challenges every holiday season, and this year will be no different. But we entered Q4 with 15% more inventory year-over-year and feel confident in our ability to serve our customers throughout the holiday. As expected, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. When compared to 2 years ago, we still saw a less promotional environment during Q3. From a sales channel perspective, results were similar to last quarter. Customers are returning to stores and they are also choosing to interact with us digitally and via phone and chat at much higher rates than pre-pandemic. Online sales were 31% of domestic revenue compared to 16% in Q3 of fiscal '20, growing by more than $2 billion during that time. Our app saw a 19% increase in unique visitors versus last year, and phone and chat sales continued to climb versus last year and 2 years ago. We continue to be an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers. During the third quarter, we reached our fastest small product delivery times ever. Compared to last year, same day delivery was up 400% and we nearly doubled the percent of products delivered within one day. Based on a third-party analysis of competitor websites, we are the leader in one day or less published shipping time across a sample of higher volume ZIP codes and higher demand items. In addition to partnering with a diversified set of delivery partners, we also thoughtfully used our employee delivery capability, as we now have more than 400 stores doing employee deliveries, with almost 60% of our customers living within 10 miles of a delivery location. We also have an industry-leading in-store pickup experience. We have, by far, the broadest assortment of CE products available for pickup, and the process is incredibly fast. In Q3, more than 90% of online orders, that were available for product pickup, were ready in less than 30 minutes of the order being placed. Customers clearly find value in coming to our stores to pick up their products as the percent of online sales picked up at our stores remained high at 42%, even with our fast home delivery options, with one third of our store pickup customers choosing our convenient curbside option. And our customer NPS for order pickup in Q3 was up versus last year and 2 years ago. In fact, in the last year, 31% of all our purchasing customers bought online and picked up in store at least once. These strong Q3 results and our market-leading omnichannel capabilities are due to our amazing associates across the company and the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people and technology. Clearly, our business has changed dramatically in the last 2 years, with digital sales more than double pre-pandemic levels and phone, chat and in-home sales growing. Customers are starting their research and shopping online and then branching out from there to all forms of digital and physical shopping depending on their specific needs. Stores are crucial to our customer experience, and they need to be even more efficient and must keep pace with greater customer expectations. For example, we know customers sometimes seek out in-person help to answer questions, and other times, they would rather use digital tools to learn about products or pick up their orders in our stores. We have made the right investment decisions to position us as a leader in omnichannel retailing. While we are proud of our progress, there are even more opportunities ahead of us and it is more important than ever to build on our position of strength and truly become a customer-obsessed company. This means we put the customer at the heart of all we do by anticipating their needs, listening, learning and applying those insights to create long-term relationships and seamless experiences. That led us to launch Best Buy Totaltech last month. Totaltech is a bold new membership program, leveraging our strengths across merchandising, fulfillment, installation, tech support, and product repair, unique capabilities that customer's value and no one else can match. Our membership program offers product discounts and periodic access to hard to get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, free product protection and many other benefits. Let me provide a tangible example of how the offer can come to life. A Totaltech member purchases a 65-inch TV and gets a $150 member discount. She gets the TV delivered and mounted on the wall in her living room. The next month, she buys a new iPhone for her daughter. As long as she keeps up her membership, she gets 2 years of product protection on the TV she bought and 2 years of AppleCare+ protection for the phone. A few weeks later, she can't get her laptop to connect to her printer. So she hops on the dedicated chat line with Geek Squad who fixes the problem by remoting into her computer, so she can get on with a productive day of working from home. As a member, she received all those benefits for $199 per year. As you can see, not only do members receive significant savings, they can also be confident that whatever their technology needs are we will be there to help. The goal is to create an experience that makes it inconceivable for members to purchase their tech from anyone else, driving a larger share of consumer electronic spend to Best Buy. We successfully rolled out the program nationally and online and converted more than 3 million former tech support members. It is very early as we just launched last month. But so far, we continue to see behaviors that we intend to drive and that we saw in the pilot, including more frequent interaction and higher incremental spend than non-members. Given the breadth of the offer, it is resonating well across all customer demographics and our new members are skewing younger than our former Total Tech Support membership program. NPS numbers across all channels are higher than for non-members as well. And importantly, our employees believe in and love articulating the value of membership to our customers. As we discussed in previous calls, we are in the midst of multiple store pilots and tests. Of course, we are always piloting concepts. But right now, we are very focused on piloting and testing to build a framework that will move us from a retailer that is focused foremost on its stores to a true omnichannel one that provides equal focus on all the ways customers shop with us. I will provide a few updates on our progress. We launched Phase 1 of our virtual store pilot last month. For this, we built out a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that is staffed with dedicated associates, including vendor-provided expert labor. It has no physical customers. Instead, customers interact with our experts via chat, audio, video and screen sharing depending on their preference and are able to see live demos, displays and physical products. It is early, and we have not rolled out all the product categories yet. But initial results are showing much higher conversion rates, as well as higher average order value than we see with historical chat interactions. In Charlotte, we have made significant progress rolling out the market pilot designed to leverage all our assets in a portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment services and outlet lockers, our digital app and both in-store and in-home consultation labor. We launched our new outlet featuring all product categories in addition to a new services hub model and re-modeled 8 stores. And in Houston, we are continuing to see strong results from our experiential store pilot and plan to roll out aspects of this more broadly in stores across the country as we enter next year. These are not the only pilots happening, and thus, they aren't the only pilots that will influence where we go as a company. From Northern California to Houston to The Bronx, we are assessing new formats and learning our way to the right physical model. At the same time, we are piloting and evolving our labor models in other markets to meet our customer's changing shopping behaviors. That means leveraging technology in stores that don't have as much labor and developing a much more flexible workforce. This is a workforce that can not only provide expert help across product categories, both in-store and virtually, but also flex into other activities like curbside fulfillment, and it empowers employees to flexibly pick up shifts at other stores or at our distribution centers. I also want to highlight our unique ability to both inspire and support our customers through our consultation and our Geek Squad services. We have almost 3,000 consultants and designers to provide free consultations across customers' homes, in stores and virtually. These consultations represent one of our highest NPS experiences consistently over 80. Importantly, they also lead to longer term and stickier customer relationships as more than 85% of customers who use the program stated they intend to continue shopping with their consultants. Turning to the product support we provide, as many of you likely know, when something goes wrong with your products or delivery or installation, it is a highly unplanned and often emotional event. Not surprisingly, our customer research tells us that customers value quick response times and demand transparency, fast repair times, and quality repairs from a trusted provider. Our Geek Squad has an industry leading set of capabilities that garner market leading NPS and also drive additional revenue for Best Buy in the moment and over time. Around 20% of our phone and computer repair customers purchase additional products the day they receive the repair. Additionally, our data shows that customers who have phone or computer repairs are far more likely to make a purchase in the following 12 months. Over time, we have also been evolving our partnerships with our vendors in response to changing customer shopping behavior. Our in-store vendor experiences are crucial to our customer experience and remain a significant source of competitive advantage. We have extended many of these in-store experiences to digital experiences. Our vendors partner with us to provide expert training and tools for our consultants and designers. And importantly, our vendors are increasingly sending sales leads from their own websites to our consultants and designers. We are also leveraging our unique Geek Squad capabilities to strengthen and expand our partnerships with our vendors. We are already the nation's largest physical destination for Apple authorized repair services, including same-day iPhone repairs, attracting new customers as one third of these Apple repair customers are new or reengaged customers for Best Buy. In October, we launched Samsung authorized phone repair service nationally. Roughly 30% of our stores will offer same-day in-store repairs completed by Samsung certified Geek Squad agents, using Samsung parts, diagnostics and tools. Phone repair is a universal need for customers, and this expansion gives Best Buy the capability to repair the overwhelming majority of phones in the marketplace. In addition, we are also starting to leverage our industry-leading and convenient buy online, pick up in store experience in partnerships with our vendors. Customers purchasing select items on samsung.com now have the option to pick up their products at their local Best Buy store and shoppers purchasing Insignia, Toshiba and Pioneer Fire TVs on amazon.com can pick up their TVs at their local Best Buy stores. For many of our vendors, we use our considerable supply chain expertise to transport their product often from the country of origin to our distribution centers. In addition to helping our vendors, it allows us to increase our level of visibility into incoming inventory and to garner greater scale. And finally, we have been investing in our long standing advertising business, building new capabilities to help vendors effectively reach our customers. Best Buy's relevance, customer relationship, and first-party data have grown along with customer's technology needs and our ability to meet those needs. These are all great examples of value we can provide to our vendor partners that many other retailers cannot. In addition to focusing our performance on our core CE and appliance categories, we are continuing to expand our assortment in newer categories where we can leverage our ability to commercialize new technology. For example, we created a robust online experience and assortment for electric transportation. And during Q3, our sales in the category more than doubled. As a result, we are expanding our online assortment of electric bikes by four times and also plan to assort them in physical stores early next year. And because customers are looking to us to complete their solutions, we have been expanding our assortment in categories like outdoor living, as more and more consumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor living spaces. This includes products like patio furniture, grills, fire pits, and electric mowers, just to name a few. In fact, earlier this month, we acquired Yardbird, a leading direct-to-consumer company that specializes in premium sustainable outdoor furniture, including dining sets, lounge seating, fire tables and accessories. We are excited about the opportunity to use our expertise in merchandising and supply chain to scale this business both online and in physical locations across the nation. We also made an exciting acquisition recently in the health space. Let me take a second to reiterate our overall health strategy and how the acquisition fits. Our Best Buy Health strategy focuses on three areas that start with our strength in retail and build to connecting patients to physicians. The first focus area is the consumer health category for customers who want to be healthier, sleep better, or need to monitor a chronic condition like diabetes or heart disease, for example. You can see this built out in a robust way on our website. The second area is active aging, which includes device based emergency response and other services for Generation A, who wish to live independently in their homes. This opportunity shows up prominently in our physical stores. The third focus area is virtual care. Best Buy's role in virtual care is to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their health care providers. The trend to this type of care is increasing, accelerated in large measure by the pandemic. To more fully meet that growing customer demand and accelerate our work with new and innovative services, we acquired a company called Current Health. Current Health developed a market leading remote patient monitoring platform that allows physicians to monitor and connect with patients in their home. Their platform includes an FDA cleared wearable medical device that monitors vital signs, a home hub, which integrates to hundreds of other monitoring devices, and integration to the patient's electronic health record. With their remote monitoring platform, combined with the scale, expertise and connection to the home that Best Buy has, we will be able to create a holistic care ecosystem that shows up for customers across all their health care needs. To be clear, even though the health care industry is evolving quickly, in many ways as a result of the pandemic impacts, it adopts new ways of doing things at a much slower pace than other industries like retail. Virtual care is a truly nascent space with significant opportunity, but it will take time and investment to develop our offerings and scale. As you can see, technology developments are driving our initiatives across the company. We need technology tools and capabilities to help us as we transform and evolve the way we operate and serve our customers. That is why we continue to devote significant resources to technology investments. For example, we are leveraging our investments in electronic sign labels to very nimbly highlight Best Buy Totaltech member pricing for customers shopping in our stores. We also just launched the ability for our electronic sign labels to provide important messaging regarding product availability, so that customers will easily be able to see if the product is in stock in that store or at another store nearby or when it could be delivered and installed. Technology was instrumental in recently launching the first of many new communication enhancements to improve our award winning appliance customer experience. Metro delivery customers, that utilize the appointment tracker page on the day of their delivery, can now see how many stops away their driver is at any given time. It may seem like a small enhancement, but already, we can see significant customer engagement with the page. Another step toward our goal to make customers feel confident and in control throughout the research, purchase, fulfillment and use of their large product. Technology was also crucial in our recent launching of next-day delivery of appliances and large TVs, which we are piloting first for in-store and online customers in our Minneapolis and Baltimore markets. Next month, we are launching a new capability, leveraging QR codes for high-velocity products that are locked up, particularly in areas of high shrink. Instead of waiting for an associate to unlock the product, the customer can scan the QR code and then proceed to check out to pay and pick up the product. And we recently implemented enhancements to our digital platform, improving flexibility across our workforce by seamlessly giving employees the ability to pick up open shifts at nearby locations in addition to their home location. These examples are a small token of the work our digital and technology teams are doing to improve the customer and employee experience. And of course, we are also continuing to make significant investments in fundamental technology capabilities like data and analytics, and broader cloud migration in order to drive scale, efficiency and effectiveness. I would like to take a moment to extend my gratitude to our people. Over the past 21 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic. They created safe environments for customers and worked tirelessly to provide excellent service, even in situations where customers resisted following safety guidelines and in some cases were disrespectful. In addition, we have increased the level of pilots and tests in the field as we evolve our operating model. This has introduced a great deal of change. We know that change is exciting, but we acknowledge it can also be challenging. I am truly grateful for and impressed by our associate's dedication, resourcefulness and flat-out determination. And I'm thrilled to say that our in-store NPS in Q3 increased versus last year and versus 2 years ago before the pandemic despite all of these disruptions. Now I would like to briefly touch on our ESG efforts and how we are working across the company to have a positive impact on our planet. Earlier this month, we announced that we are a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative that aims to accelerate climate action within the retail industry. Best Buy's participation builds on our existing efforts to reduce our carbon footprint. We are proud of our progress in reducing emissions 61% since 2009, and we have pledged to be carbon neutral by 2040. We have also taken on a more specific focus on the circular economy within our operations and with our customers. In Q3, we collected and responsibly recycled more than 48 million pounds of consumer electronics, keeping products and commodities out of landfills. To help our customers live more sustainably, last quarter, we sold more than 5 million ENERGY STAR certified products, helping our customers reduce their carbon footprint and save on utility bills. We also kept more than 600,000 devices in use longer and out of landfills by leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek squad repair services and Best Buy outlets. These are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth. In summary, we have delivered remarkable year-to-date results, and I am so proud of the execution of all our teams. We are looking forward to a strong holiday season and believe we are extremely well positioned with both the tech customer's wants and fast and convenient ways to get it. We launched some of our Black Friday deals in mid-October that included a price guarantee for all customers. And this past Friday, started Black Friday early by making almost all of our Black Friday deals available. Throughout the holiday season, we are promising free next-day delivery on thousands of items. And of course, store pickup, whether in-store or curbside, will be a great and convenient option for our customers to get their products. Building on that, as we think about next year and beyond, we are mindful of just how much the consumer has changed and how enduring that change will be. Terms like home nesting and virtual care have been invented to describe what all of us know so well, that where we work, entertain, receive health care, and connect has changed, and our homes are now central to our lives more than ever before. The penetration of technology associated with this way of living has been and continues to be sizable. And we are already seeing shorter upgrade cycles as technology evolves and we constantly optimize our homes. The demand for convenience and experience on the customers' terms has exponentially driven change. Our hypothesis has consistently been that true omnichannel retailing would create differentiated experiences that allow us to seamlessly and conveniently engage and retain customers. As such, we have continuously invested in these experiences and notably, we never defined omnichannel as being stores and online. Instead, we included our unique and powerful service, virtual and in-home capabilities. We are certain that technology will continue to play a more dominant role in consumers' lives. Given our omnichannel capabilities, the ones we have today and the ones we are building for the future, we are fully confident that we will capitalize on a much larger, more broadly defined consumer electronics category and be able to better serve a customer who will be using and upgrading much of that CE more frequently. We plan to hold an Investor event next March to share more detail on our initiatives, provide our thoughts on our financial model going forward and introduce longer-term financial targets. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more color on our financial results. Matt Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. We are once again reporting strong financial results that continue to support our belief that technology plays an even more important role in everyone's lives and we are uniquely positioned to serve them. Despite lapping the extraordinary 23% comparable sales growth from last year, we were once again able to generate positive comparable sales growth in each fiscal month of the third quarter. Compared to our guidance, Enterprise revenue of $11.9 billion exceeded the high end of our revenue outlook of $11.6 billion, driven by the better-than-expected comparable sales growth of 1.6%. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate and SG&A expense were essentially in line with our expectations. Compared to last year, Enterprise revenue grew $57 million, and our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.08 increased $0.02. A lower share count resulted in a $0.12 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5.8% decreased 30 basis points as we invested in the launch of our new Totaltech membership. When comparing our results against 2 years ago for the third quarter of our fiscal '20, total revenue grew more than 20%. Additionally, our Domestic store channel revenue was approximately flat versus 2 years ago, while online revenue grew almost 150% in that time frame. As a result of the higher revenue and our ability to adjust to a new customer shopping behavior, our enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate was 160 basis points higher this quarter than the comparable quarter from 2 years ago. Let me now share more details specific to our third quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue increased 1.2% to almost $11 billion. This increase was driven by a comparable sales increase of 2%, which was partially offset by the loss of revenue from store closures in the past year. As Corie shared, the biggest contributors to the comp sales growth in the quarter were appliances, home theater and mobile phones. After delivering significant growth for the past several quarters and lapping a 46% comp in the third quarter of last year, computing comparable sales were down slightly on a year-over-year basis, but still up nearly $1 billion from 2 years ago. In addition, our services comparable sales declined 5.6% this quarter. This was primarily the result of our new Totaltech membership, which includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue generating services such as warranty and installation. In our International segment, revenue decreased 7.8% to $925 million. This decrease was driven by the loss of approximately $90 million in revenue from exiting Mexico and a comparable sales decline of 3% in Canada. Partially offsetting these items was the benefit of approximately 450 basis points from foreign currency. Turning now to gross profit. The domestic gross profit rate decreased 60 basis points to 23.4%. As expected, the decrease was due to, one, lower profit margin rates, which were primarily driven by lapping lower levels of promotions, product damages and returns compared to last year as well as higher inventory shrink. And two, lower services margin rates, which included rate pressure from Totaltech. The previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from the company's private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. The gross profit rate pressure from our new membership offering primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and associated costs compared to our previous Total Tech Support offer. As Corie mentioned, like many others, we saw increased transportation costs within our supply chain. However, this pressure was offset by reduced parcel expense since our mix of online sales was lower than last year. The International non-GAAP gross profit rate increased 240 basis points to 25%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by improved product margin rates in Canada and a loss of lower margin sales from the Mexico exit. Moving next to SG&A. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $9 million and improved 20 basis points versus last year as a percentage of revenue. As expected, higher advertising expense and increased technology investments were partially offset by last year's $40 million donation to the Best Buy Foundation and lower incentive compensation. When comparing to 2 years ago, Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $155 million and decreased 230 basis points as a percentage of revenue. The largest drivers of the increase versus fiscal '20 were higher incentive compensation, increased technology and advertising investments and additional variable costs due to the higher sales volume, partially offsetting these items was lower store payroll expense. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $3.5 billion in cash. At the end of Q3, our inventory balance was 15% higher than last year's comparable period and was 13% higher than our Q3 ending inventory balance from 2 years ago. The increased inventory represents our plans to support the current demand for technology as well as last year's unusually low inventory balance. Earlier this month, we completed our acquisitions of Current Health and Yardbird, which will be reflected on our cash flow statement in Q4. The combined purchase price of the two transactions was approximately $485 million and they were funded with cash. The Current Health acquisition was a larger cash outlay at approximately $400 million and is expected to have a slightly negative impact on our Q4 non-GAAP operating income. We are not expecting either acquisition to have a material impact on our revenue performance this year. During the quarter, we returned a total of $577 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $405 million and dividends of $172 million. With a year-to-date share buyback spend of $1.7 billion, we still expect to spend more than $2.5 billion in share repurchases this year. Let me next share more color on our guidance for the fourth quarter, which remains very similar to the implied guidance we provided last quarter. We expect comparable sales growth to be in the range of down 2% to up 1% to last year, which is on top of our 12.6% comparable sales growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Like other companies, we continue to monitor the evolving impacts of the pandemic and supply chain pressures driven by global demand. We are confident in our ability to navigate the ever changing environment. From a profit rate perspective, we are planning for a non-GAAP rate that is approximately 30 basis points below last year's rate due to the estimated impact of our new Totaltech offer, which we expect to be partially offset by a more favorable product mix. From a non-GAAP SG&A standpoint, we are planning dollars to increase approximately 8% compared to last year. The largest drivers of SG&A increase are expected to be technology investments, increased advertising, health investments, and higher compensation, in addition, incentive compensation. In addition, we are planning on increased spend compared to our previous outlook for store labor and call center support this holiday season to better support the customer experience. Turning to our full year outlook. We expect the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $51.8 billion to $52.3 billion compared to our previous guide of $51 billion to $52 billion. Comparable sales growth of 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our previous guide of 9% to 11%, and a non-GAAP gross profit rate slightly higher than last year. For SG&A, we expect growth of approximately 9.5%, which compares to our prior outlook of 9%. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 20%, and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $800 million to $850 million. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Chukumba with Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter, particularly your ability to comp the comp against that really tough comparison year-over-year. So having said all that, one thing that just struck me a little bit was that you simply [ph] called out shrink as a gross margin headwind. I was just wondering if you can just provide a little bit more color around that? Thanks. Corie Barry : Yeah, absolutely, Anthony. I think you've probably seen in the media that across retail, we are definitely seeing more and more, particularly, organized retail crime and incidence of shrink in our locations. And I think you've heard other retailers talk about it, and we certainly have seen it as well. I want to start with, our priority has always been and will remain the safety of our people, whether that's the pandemic, whether that is unruly customers, whether that is outright theft, which is a great deal of what we're seeing right now, and this is a real issue that hurts and scares real people. We are doing a number of things to protect our people and our customers. We are - as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we are finding ways where we can lock up product but still make that a good customer experience. In some instances, we're hiring security. We're working with our vendors on creative ways we can stage the product. We're working with trade organizations. But you can see that pressure in our financials. And more importantly, frankly, you can see that pressure our associates. This is traumatizing for our associates and is unacceptable. We are doing everything we can to try to create as safe as possible environments. Anthony Chukumba : Got it. Good luck with the holiday selling season. Corie Barry : Thank you, Anthony. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Hannah Pittock : Hi. This is actually Hannah Pittock on for Simeon Gutman. Thanks for taking the time. I wanted to ask on your Q4 guide. On the top line, it implies a pretty big deceleration on the comp stack. Are you seeing a slowdown in demand? Was there some pull forward do you think in holiday purchasing into Q3 or is there maybe some conservatism built in there? Any detail you can give? Matt Bilunas : Sure. I'll take that. This is Matt. We're projecting Q4 comps to be up 1% to down 2% compared to last year. The guidance range we actually gave is slightly up from the implied guidance range from last quarter. As a reminder, in August, we materially raised our sales guidance for the back half of the year from the expectations we had that we started the year. We still feel really confident about our inventory levels and our positioning for the holiday. And so I'd say Q4 is a little bit more unique of a period of time, a place where our category is leveraged by many retailers over the holiday gifting season. I would also say that some sales probably got pulled into October summer [ph] last year as a lot of the narrative in the media and supply chain constraints were our consumers. So during the first three weeks of last year as well, the gaming consoles released, which provided a bit of a lift. And we're also very mindful of lapping the stimulus dollars that came in January. As we talked about last year, we saw strong results in October, the sales moderated, and they started to pick back up in January. The last thing I'd say about Q4 is Super Bowl actually, majority of the business is shifting into Q1 of next year. We're starting the November about flattish sales. So we're still encouraged by the holiday demand that the consumer is very strong still, and so we're excited and think we're well positioned. Hannah Pittock : That's very helpful. Maybe a quick follow-up just on your Domestic versus International segment. Obviously, Domestic kind of decelerated sequentially, and International actually picked up. In Q4, can you tell us anything about kind of the relative contribution you expect? Matt Bilunas : I would expect that contribution to be relatively the same in Q3. Our International business on a 2 year basis was pretty similar to the US. They actually did stronger sales in Q3 last year than the Domestic business. So relative to the US pretty consistent. And a lot of the same drivers for the US business are similar internationally as well. Hannah Pittock : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Horvers : Thanks. And good morning. So I guess focusing a little bit on the gross margin and the adoption of Totaltech. Just curious on that impact in the third quarter - as you think about the fourth quarter, down 30 basis points expected, so the Totaltech is a number than that. I was just curious how much of that is sort of diminishment of warranty sales versus more of an accounting phenomenon that you're sort of recognizing the benefit of Totaltech over an extended period of time versus prior? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. Good morning. Yeah, the Totaltech impact essentially is due to just the enhanced benefits for that offering versus the Totaltech support offering as we've talked about last quarter. It's really that additional benefit that drives more of the - more short term pressure on the gross margin rate. There is a little bit of revenue recognition difference between Totaltech support and Totaltech with Totaltech support a bit more was recognized in the first couple of months. Totaltech support is more spread out across the entire year of some more of that pressure is coming from that. But I'd also note that the whole goal of Totaltech support is to actually drive more sales and then drive more product sales and that will take a little bit of time as we start to ramp up the program. So that will help offset some of the pressure you see from the cannibalization of the services business. Christopher Horvers : And just as a quick follow-up on the last question. Do you have a sense or an estimate of perhaps how much January actually benefited from stimulus as we think about the sequencing of the current quarter? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. I mean, we said all of last year that stimulus is really hard to break out. It certainly did have a benefit. We could see the business change in January from the previous months. So we know it did have an impact. It's really hard to break out specifically. Christopher Horvers : Got it. Understood. Have a great holiday season. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. So there are some other big box retailers that have gotten more invested in helping customers age in place, which you talked about in the prepared remarks. Clearly, there's a bigger focus on technology and Connected Health at Best Buy. How are you working on increasing customer awareness? Like what does the marketing look like for this particular initiative? Corie Barry : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Liz. We have been really focused on this idea that tech could be instrumental in helping people age more comfortably in their homes for quite a while. It started with our purchase of a GreatCall a few years ago. And part of the reason that we brought GreatCall on board is they had massive experience in dealing with an aging population. And specifically to your question, targeting the right messages to the right people, which is not just targeting the aging population, it's also targeting caregivers who may be looking for some of this product. And so you've seen us over time. We established a relationship with AARP back in March of 2020 as one of our venues. We have a lot of actually, in this space, direct mail and direct targeting because for the populations that we're looking at here, those are some of the most effective means that we have. And then over time, I think you're going to see some of our more broad-based Best Buy messaging, really pointing to the fact that we have a variety of solutions that can help people age in their homes. It's not always just the devices and the care wrappers. Sometimes it's things like a Facebook portal where you can connect with someone on the other side really simply and easily or a device \u2013 you know, a camera and a security system where I can easily lock my door without having to get up or I can keep an eye on that aging loved one. And I think already, you've seen me will continue to see run the gamut of both these very targeted messages to the population that we really want to inform all the way to these kind of more broad-based solution driven messages about what we could help you do to care for a loved one. Liz Suzuki : Great. And just a follow-up on how Totaltech could potentially play into that? And if there are any key performance indicators you can highlight that you're looking at on total effect as you track the opportunity there? Corie Barry : Well, what's interesting about Totaltech in the aging in place scenario is that, it is more important than ever that your technology works for you if you're relying on it for your safety or if you're a caregiver if you're relying on it for the safety of others. And so the support wrapper around all of the things that we're talking about in health is important. And it also will help, obviously, this population, whether it's the caregiver again or the person being cared for, add more devices, feel comfortable adding devices. We can go to your own and help you install those, and then we can keep them up and running, and I think that's really important. In terms of the KPIs that we look at, it's really true across Totaltech. We're looking for things like increased frequency of interactions. And that may be everything from browsing on the website all the way to coming in the store and making an actual purchase. We're looking for stickiness of that consumer, meaning they're more willing to come back Best Buy bigger share of wallet, more purchase behavior with Best Buy over the longer term. And that will be true whether we're talking about aging in place or whether we're talking about the other aspects of Totaltech. And then obviously, we're going to look for customer satisfaction and engagement with the brand and really trying to almost surprise and delight and over deliver wherever we can for these paying members. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. Corie Barry : You bit. Thanks, Liz. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : Good morning. Nice quarter, congrats. Corie Barry : Thank you. Brian Nagel : So the question I have, just with regard to promotions. So you called out here in the third quarter, higher promotions is somewhat of a headwind to gross margins. But you also made the point that the promotional activity is still more subdued than it was pre-pandemic. And then I don't think you gave the guidance for Q4 within the down 30 basis points in gross margin, I think there was a mention promotion. So the question I have is as you look at what's happening out with promotions, maybe some more color on \u2013 there is greater color on kind of who are what's driving these promotions. And then where do you think we're going? Are we heading back to pre-pandemic levels or do you foresee promotional activity remaining more subdued as we go forward? Matt Bilunas : Good morning, Brian. Yeah, I think in Q3, we've talked about how we expected promotionality to increase, and we certainly saw that, especially in places where inventory is starting to become a little more freeing up and notably in computing. We didn't call it out in Q4, and Q4 product margin rates are expected to be a little bit better, more from product mix, mixing out of things, gaming consoles and computing. At this point, promotionality, we don't necessarily see it as a good guy or a bad guy in Q4. As you would imagine, Q4 is very promotional and competitive every year. And so right now, so last year, we were very focused on that as well. This year, we will continue to look at. But we don't expect it on a yearly basis to be necessarily more or less promotional. Now against 2 years ago, certainly, we would expect it to be a little less promotional than we saw 2 years ago. Where it heads is something that we're going to have to monitor. That's one of the kind of still things that we're evaluating for next year. Clearly, as inventory becomes more free, you can imagine that promotionality is going to start to increase in categories more one at a time as we get into next year. And so likely starting the year with a little bit more promotionality. But we're not really guiding next year, but I would expect that to start to turn over the next number of quarters. Brian Nagel : That's very helpful. A second quick follow-up, if I could. Just with regard to - so appliance is a key sales driver here in Q3. Lot of talk about higher prices in appliances, so the question I have is to what extent was inflation in that category actually an incremental sales driver for you? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. Specifically to appliances, that is one of the areas where it's been pretty well noted that prices have gone up. And so we - and that's probably an area where, in most cases, we've those prices on to the consumer. So those prices have - or sales prices have increased. That's not to say that, that happens in all circumstances and a lot of categories where you still want to make sure you're very competitive with our pricing, even if costs do go up your, you're actually being thoughtful about serving them in the best way possible. I think generally, as you look at our ASPs, inflation - the inflation or cost of those goods going up is still the smaller part of those - what we would see as ASP increases right now, still the bigger part of the ASP increases would be just premium mix of our business right now versus the inflation estimate. So it is a little higher generally overall than we saw in the first half of the year, but still not the biggest impact to ASPs. Corie Barry : And Brian, I think this is why in this space, we continue to really invest in the experience because our ability to deliver on some of those more premium items in the assortment is really distinctive and different. And so this investment - and this is a great example of the investment in the experience is not just for today, but it's so that we continue to represent the premium side of the business over the longer term. Brian Nagel : Appreciate all the color. Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : Thanks. I had a two part question. One was I wanted to understand a little bit more about the SG&A dollar growth in the fourth quarter. How much of that is due to the acquisitions or the particular membership investment? And how much of that is just the inflation or normal growth in the business? Matt Bilunas : Sure. The Q4 SG&A, essentially, we have to first start with the idea. Our business is very different than it has been over the last few years. Over 2 years ago, the way customers are shopping, the channel they're shopping is very different. And there's just a lot more volume coming through generally compared a couple of years ago. So as you look at a year-over-year difference, we're still seeing continued investments in technology and health being a driver of that SG&A increase. Our advertising is also an area where it's up year-over-year. And that is included and that is the total tech launch that we've talked about. We're actually also increasing our store and call center labor to better support the customer experience. Last year, in Q4, it was probably - we would say probably running the light from where we wanted to be. So we've made the decision to invest a little bit more from a customer experience standpoint. And while incentive compensation was flat on a year-over-year basis in the back half of this year, is going to be flat. The pressure in Q4 is actually a pressure in Q4 versus a slight of a good eye in Q3. So those are what's driving the SG&A on a year-over-year basis. And a lot of we're doing is really focused on investing as we've talked about to make sure our customer experience is in the right spot, and we're actually positioning ourselves well for the future. Greg Melich : And maybe to flip it around a little bit, inventory up, I guess, 15% year-on-year and still 13% versus 2019. How should we think about that growth in inventory versus a comp that looks like it will be flattish in the fourth quarter, at least in your plan? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. I mean when you look at it versus a 2 year sales volume increase, I mean, the inventory is much more in line. We actually, when we look at our inventory, look at how many days of supply we have outstanding and we're in that very normal range of days of supply at this point. Now there's still pockets of constraint in areas like gaming consoles and things like that, but we feel really good about it on a 2 year basis. It's seemingly - it's in line for us as we look forward to the sales. Corie Barry : And Greg, I would just underscore something Matt said in his prepared remarks, we were unduly light last year in inventory. And that's why we're going back to the 2 year \u2013 2 year stack growth of right in that 13% range and then inventory 2 year in that same range. So I just think last year is not a great indicator because I think everyone was looking - we certainly were looking for more last year. Greg Melich : Got it. And I guess if I could cheat with one more. Has the business - the seasonality of the operating margin sort of fundamentally changed now with the growth of services, Total Tech? Or is that still an anomaly, you think? Matt Bilunas : Yeah... Greg Melich : Improved margins look like the rest of the year? Matt Bilunas : Yeah, I think what you've seen from us this year, last year was a little unique each quarter. But this year, what you've seen is actually improved operating margin rates in each of the first three quarters more than what we've seen. If you look at a 2 year stack, it's much different in the first three quarters. I think just generally, technology is important for all our lives regardless of how the seasons and seasons that are starting to spread out across the year. So the operating margins have on a relative 2 year basis have been improving in the first 3 quarters. And quite honestly, the volumes in Q4, it's very important for us to make sure we have the right expense profile to support the customers. Greg Melich : Okay. Corie Barry : Just one more little bit of color and again, at it in his remarks, but this will be the first full quarter of Totaltech too. And so you'll start to see that go through into next year as you get into those other quarters. So that makes it a little different this year comparing Q4 to the rest of the course. But everything Matt said in the rest of it. I mean, our goal would actually be a little bit more even business throughout the year, ultimately. Greg Melich : Makes sense. Congrats. Have a great holiday. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. I just had two questions on all the pilots that you mentioned in the prepared comments. First, with the virtual store, how are you thinking about this longer term? Do you think it will be a concept where you just need one? Or is it something that rolls out and will always be integrated into a DC? And then the flexible labor model, I know it's early and also in a pilot stage, but has this helped you at all in finding workers in this tight labor market? And how do you think about potential savings from this initiative? Corie Barry : So I'll start with virtual store. Obviously, really early into this, so we're really just getting our legs under is. So it's hard for me to say whether or not there's more than one. The nice part is you should be able to get very good from one location in a model like this, right. Because you can flexibly queue people and you can move them through at your own speed, and you could do this across all the departments in this kind of fake store that's virtual. So I don't think this is going to be about a ton of virtual stores throughout the network. I think it's going to be about scale with a few locations that can provide some interesting use cases. Because truthfully, it's not just about the customer use cases where they might find the virtual store where they're doing digital shopping. It also could be about employee use cases, where I might be in the car installation area and may not have the expertise, but I could zoom right into one of our installation, our Autotech experts who could help you in the moment even as an employee, it gives you a lot of confidence there, too. So I think what we want to find out right now is what are the use cases? How often is it being used? And then ultimately, what does that customer experience look like? But like we said in the prepared remarks, we'd like what we're seeing early. And we'll see just how far you can stretch this kind of one asset that we have right now. In terms of flexible labor, absolutely, it is helpful for us in this environment, and it's helpful on a couple of levels. One, the customer shopping behaviors have changed and they continue to change and they can change week-to-week depending on how important something like speed is as an example. Like the week before Christmas, in-store pickup curbside will become very important assets. And with a more flexible model, I can move employees and employees can being moved to different areas in the store. That means they can pick up more hours or potentially more flexible hours. The other thing that hasn't been brought to light as much as there still are many people calling in sick, which we want. If they're not feeling well, we want them to stay home. A model like this allows you to much more flexibly cover for those call offs. So it's not just about hiring and retention. It's actually about how can I move the labor around the store in the most flexible way. And then the last thing I would say is we have more employees than ever in the history of the company that are skilled in multiple areas in the store. And that isn't just about us flexibly leveraging that labor. That is about them opting into potentially schedules and even in some cases, pay grades that meets whatever they want to try to accomplish in their lives. And that's really for the employee the more positive side of the flexible arrangement and ultimately adding to more confidence in their capabilities and their interactions with customers. That's why we tend to see higher NPS correlate very highly with multiple skill sets. Kate McShane : Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. And good morning. My first question is around the Totaltech offering and how we think about that into 2022? Should we be thinking about 20 to 30 basis points of gross margin pressure through at least the first half of the year? And should we think about additional sales contributions building through 2022? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. As you can imagine, we're not in a position to guide for next year. What we've talked about is the more benefits included in Total Tech certainly are causing a near-term pressure on the business. Some of those things will continue on. A lot of what we're still trying to do is understand the incrementality, the usage, the frequency, all of those things go into understanding what the overall increment does to the business. In addition to that incremental sales of our products, we're still in the process of evaluating. So I would imagine to be a continued pressure heading into next year, exactly how much we're still trying to evaluate. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you. And then my follow-up question is, when we think about the market's growth rate potential over the next year or so, given the fact that tech is more important than ever in consumers' lives, is this market one that's likely to continue growing in the near term? Or are there pressure points because of the some of the year-over-year comparisons with computing and other areas have seen such a surge in growth from the pandemic? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. I mean, I think certainly it's something we're evaluating over what the market is going to look like over the next few years. We're certainly not in a position to guide next year from a sales perspective either. You're right, comping, there's going to be some big quarters next year. We grew 27% in the first half of last year. So we very much could see some bumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But again, fundamentally, we believe that our customers never technology has only grown and that we have a very unique way to serve those customers, and there's still a lot of long-term opportunities. We're excited about our Total Tech membership program. We're excited about investing more in our business around technology and our operating model changing in our store portfolio. So there's a lot of room for optimism in addition to understanding that Total Tech's that much more important. We'll have to see where the industry goes. Corie Barry : Yeah. And just to underscore, I think you'll continue to see product innovation at an accelerated pace. And you will see CE proliferate into other areas like you're seeing it proliferate into health care or even into outdoor spaces. And so I think that makes it even harder for us to answer the question because it's not even just about how you define the market. It's about how the market, in essence, expands over time because it taps into new areas. And that's the part that really has us excited for the future even if to Matt's point, there might be a bumpy quarter here or there. It's really the sustainability of CE as an ever-evolving space from here on out. Corie Barry : And with that, I want to thank all of you so much for joining us today, and I know it's a very busy earnings season, so we appreciate it.

Corie Barry : Thank you so much, Mollie. Good morning, everyone. We are so pleased you could join us today as we report our fiscal \u201822 results and take this opportunity to update our longer-term strategy and our multiyear financial outlook. Today, we will discuss how our business has evolved and how we are planning to drive value over the next few years. We\u2019re not planning to cover all our initiatives or all our business units. We\u2019ve tried to be as succinct as possible to focus on the topics and initiatives that we believe are most important for you to understand about our business, our plans and where we believe we\u2019re headed, both for fiscal \u201823 and for the longer term. First, let\u2019s discuss our fiscal \u201822 results. Fiscal \u201822 was another record year. In addition to record revenue and earnings, our leaders continue to drive new ways of operating, and our employees continue to do amazing things in the face of unprecedented challenge and change to support our customers\u2019 technology needs in knowledgeable, fast and convenient ways. As we discussed when we entered the year, we anchored on three concepts we believe to be permanent and structural implications of the pandemic that were and are shaping our strategic priorities and investments. One, customer shopping behavior will be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts customers entirely in control to shop how they want. Our strategy is to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. Two, our workforce will need to evolve in a way that meets the needs of customers while still providing more flexible opportunities for our employees. And three, technology is a need and is playing an even more crucial role in people\u2019s lives. And as a result, our purpose to enrich lives through technology has never been more important. With these concepts in mind, we piloted numerous store formats to test and learn in the past year. We advanced our flexible workforce initiatives and invested in our employees\u2019 well-being. We introduced new technology tools designed to support both, our customers and also our employees. And we also launched a bold new membership program called Best Buy Totaltech designed to significantly elevate our customer experience and drive incremental sales. We will be talking more about all these topics today. All of this was against a constantly evolving backdrop. During the year, we navigated supply chain and transportation challenges, uncertainty as virus peaks rolled across the country, and then most recently, the disruption from the Omicron wave. Our teams did an amazing job against that backdrop, expertly managing supply chain challenges since the beginning of the pandemic to bring in products our customers needed. During the year, we continued serving our customers digitally at much higher rates. Our online revenue was 34% of our domestic revenue. And while it declined versus last year, it was up 115% or $8.8 billion compared to two years ago. At the same time, we also reached our fastest package delivery speeds ever. We are an industry leader in fast and convenient product fulfillment for our customers. In fact, the percent of online orders we delivered in one day was twice as high as pre-pandemic levels, despite the significant increase in volume during that same timeframe. These record results are driven by the investment decisions we have made in the last several years in supply chain, store operations, our people and technology, many of which we discussed at our investor updates, both in 2017 and 2019. More importantly, these results are driven by our amazing associates across the Company. Over the past 24 months, they have flexibly dealt with rapidly changing store operations as we responded to impacts of the pandemic. They created safe environments for our customers, and they worked tirelessly to provide excellent service. In fact, despite all the changes we went through in the last year, we delivered NPS improvements, both online and in our stores. I\u2019m truly grateful for and continue to be impressed by our associates\u2019 dedication, resourcefulness and flat-out determination. From a financial perspective, we delivered record revenue and earnings per share. Our comparable sales growth was 10.4% on top of a very strong 9.7% last year, growing $8 billion over the past two years. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was just over $10, up 27% compared to last year. And compared to two years ago, we expanded our non-GAAP operating income rate by 110 basis points. Our non-GAAP return on investment improved 840 basis points compared to two years ago, and we drove more than $6.5 billion of free cash flow in the last two years. In fiscal \u201822, we returned $4.2 billion of that to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We also continue to deepen our commitment to the community and the environment. Many of you may have had the opportunity to view the video that was playing before the event started. We continue to believe that our ESG efforts are directly tied to long-term value creation, and I am proud of all our initiatives, but we only have time for me to cover a few examples today. We committed to spend at least $1.2 billion with BIPOC and diverse businesses by 2025. The goal is to create a stronger community of diverse suppliers and to help increase by BIPOC representation in the tech industry. We also committed to opening 100 Teen Tech Centers by fiscal \u201825. During fiscal \u201822, we opened 9 to end the year with a total of 44. These provide teens in disinvested communities access to the training, tools and mentorship needed to succeed in post-secondary opportunities and careers. In addition, we\u2019re building a diverse talent pipeline for jobs of the future. In terms of the environment, in fiscal \u201822, we were a founding member of the Race to Zero initiative, committing to accelerate climate action within the retail industry. We are also driving sustainability through the unique consumer electronics circular economy. We help keep devices in use longer and out of landfills by leveraging our customer trade-in program, Geek Squad repair services, responsible recycling and Best Buy outlets. These are initiatives our customers and vendors value and capabilities no one else has at our scale and breadth, and we are honored to be recognized for our work. Notably, we are placed in the top 5 on Barron\u2019s Most Sustainable Companies list for the past five years in a row. This ranking recognizes our strong performance across all aspects of ESG. In addition, we are on the CDP Climate A List for the fifth year, which recognizes leadership in making a positive impact on the environment. Now, let\u2019s move on to our Q4 results. I am extremely proud of what we accomplished during the fourth quarter. Our team showed remarkable execution and dedication to serving our customers throughout the important gift-giving season. This was evidenced by the fact that we drove improvement in year-over-year customer NPS metrics across almost all areas, particularly for in-store, online and chat experiences. In fact, we saw our best-ever customer satisfaction scores for our in-store pickup experience. Online sales were almost 40% of domestic revenue compared to 43% last year and 25% in Q4 of fiscal \u201820. We reached our fastest holiday delivery times ever, shipping products to customer homes more than 25% faster than last year and two years ago. We also completed the purchase of two companies that aligned with our strategy, which Jason and Deborah will talk about later this morning. We are deliberately investing in our future and furthering our competitive differentiation. This, as we expected, is temporarily impacting our profitability. The biggest areas of investment in Q4 were our new membership program, technology and Best Buy Health, all core to our future growth potential. In the face of unexpected change, I remain inspired by the way our teams across the enterprise remain flexible to ensure our customers were able to find the perfect gift. We remain well-positioned as we head into fiscal \u201823 as the unique technology provider for the home. I\u2019ll turn the meeting over to Matt to cover more details on our Q4 results and fiscal \u201823 outlook. Matt? Matt Bilunas : Thank you, Corie, and good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were all able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. Our Q4 revenue was $16.4 billion. Our domestic comparable sales declined 2.1%, and our enterprise comp sales declined 2.3%. Revenue grew 8% versus two years ago. It was only slightly below the low end of our revenue guidance for the quarter due to a few factors. The first factor was inventory availability. We expected to have pockets of inventory constraints as we entered the quarter and called out a few areas, including appliances, gaming and mobile phones. As the quarter progressed, inventory was more constrained than we anticipated within a few categories and brands. These constraints included some high-demand holiday items, and the categories most impacted were mobile phones and computing. The second factor impacting our results was Omicron. The Omicron wave and the resulting high levels of employee callouts led to a temporary reduction in our store hours in January and to start fiscal \u201823. In mid-February, our staffing level started to improve and we increased store operating hours for the majority of our stores. Excluding these two factors, our revenue would have been comfortably in the guidance range we provided for the quarter. From a category standpoint, on a weighted basis the top areas with positive comparable sales growth included appliances, virtual reality, home theater and headphones. We saw comparable sales declines in gaming, mobile phones, tablets and services. Turning now to gross profit. Our non-GAAP gross profit rate decreased 50 basis points to 20.2%. This was about 20 basis points lower than we expected, primarily due to increased proportionality. When comparing to last year, the largest driver was our services category, primarily driven by Totaltech. Our product margins were largely flat to last year, as the benefit from category sales mix was offset by increased promotions. Higher profit-sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement was a benefit to gross profit rate compared to last year. Lastly, our international gross profit rate improved 210 basis points to last year, which provided a weighted benefit of approximately 20 basis points to our enterprise results. Our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A dollars grew 5% versus last year, less than our guide of 8% growth, primarily due to lower than anticipated incentive compensation. Within our domestic segment, our SG&A dollars increased $139 million. The largest drivers were, one, advertising, which included campaigns for both, holiday and to drive awareness for our new membership offering; two, technology; three, increased store and call center labor that helped drive the record customer satisfaction scores Corie shared; and four, Best Buy Health, which includes the impact associated with our acquisition. Before I discuss the \u201823 financial outlook, let me spend some time on our new Totaltech membership program. Corie will provide a more holistic overview later in her presentation, but I will add some color on the impacts to our Q4 results and for next year. Totaltech is a near-term investment to dive long-term value. The thesis is that over time, we will capture incremental product sales from our members that will lead to higher operating income. But, as we discussed in prior earnings calls, it does come with near-term profitability impacts. First, at $199, the standalone membership is profitable. It just isn\u2019t as profitable as legacy service memberships, due to the breadth of benefits and the cost to fulfill them. Second, there is a loss of revenue and profit from existing revenue streams that are now included as benefits in the program. For example, previously standalone services like extended warranties and products installations are now included within our Totaltech membership. We still offer these services on a standalone basis or to nonmembers. But, you can imagine there\u2019s an aspect of cannibalization as members are no longer paying incrementally for these items. So, what does all this mean? We expect that the gross profit rate of our services category will reset to a new level going forward that is lower than it was prior to launching Totaltech. The way to drive more operating income, despite this lower services gross profit rate, is to add far more members than we thought was possible under our previous membership offerings. The key to increased profit will be through increased volume through a combination of more recurring membership revenue and incremental product purchases of our members. The number of memberships grew very nicely in Q4, and our plans for fiscal \u201823 assume continued growth, but it\u2019ll take some time to reach the scale necessary to offset the lower gross profit rate I just described. Therefore, Totaltech remains a pressure in fiscal \u201823, but we expect it to be a meaningful driver of both, higher sales and operating income dollars in fiscal \u201825 targets. Now, let\u2019s talk about our overall fiscal \u201823 outlook. Our guide is anchored around a comparable sales decline in the range of 1% to 4% and a 5.4% non-GAAP operating income rate. Our non-GAAP diluted EPS outlook is $8.85 to $9.15. Before we discuss the broader assumptions driving our guide, I want to touch on our expected tax rate. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate is planned at a more normalized level of 24.5% in fiscal \u201823 compared to 19% rate in fiscal \u201822. As you may recall, our Q2 results this past year included a $0.47 diluted EPS benefit from the resolution of certain discrete matters. Now, I\u2019d like to share a few important assumptions underpinning our guidance. First, we anticipate the traditional CE industry to decline in the low- to mid-single digits next year as we lap the high levels of growth and stimulus actions from this past year. In addition, we anticipate the number of store closures to be in the range of 20 to 30, which is consistent with the trend over the past five years. As I mentioned, our fiscal 2023 guidance assumes non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 5.4% compared to 6% in fiscal \u201822. To be clear, the biggest driver of the lower operating income rate in fiscal \u201823 is our investment in Totaltech. As I just described, this near-term pressure will drive long-term value for our shareholders. There are of course, other factors that we expect to impact our results that for the most part offset each other in fiscal \u201823. We do expect higher levels of promotional activity to pressure our gross profit rate, which is partially offset by the favorable impact of expected growth and our monetization of our advertising business, or Best Buy Ads. We expect our full year SG&A expense to be lower than fiscal \u201822 levels. The largest year-over-year variance is lower incentive compensation expense as we reset our plans after paying out at higher levels in fiscal \u201822 due to the overachieving of our performance targets. We expect the lower incentive comp to be partially offset by a few areas. The first area is higher technology cost, primarily due to annualizing spend in fiscal \u201822; the second area is higher depreciation and store remodel expense, as Damien will discuss later; and lastly, we expect to see higher SG&A dollars in support of our Best Buy Ads business. Finally, as you may have noticed, we are not providing quarterly guidance, but I would like to provide some insight on the assumed phasing for fiscal \u201823. Due to the strong first half comps last year, we expect our full year comparable sales decline to be weighted more heavily in the first half of the year. In addition, we expect to see significantly more year-over-year operating income rate pressure in the first half of the year compared to the back half. To summarize, the two largest variables for fiscal \u201823 financial results are the short-term industry declines as we lap high growth in government stimulus and the investment in our new membership program that will drive long-term value. As we look to fiscal \u201825, we expect the CE industry will return to the high levels we saw in fiscal \u201822 and that Totaltech will drive meaningful growth. I will now turn the meeting back over to Corie to begin our strategic update. Corie Barry : Thank you so much, Matt. As I noted closing out my Q4 summary, we remain well-positioned as we head into fiscal \u201823. I\u2019d like to expand on this a bit as we highlight our strategic positioning. There are three key points you should take away from this morning. First, technology is a necessity, and we are the unique tech solutions provider for the home. Second, we have built an ecosystem of customer-centric assets, delivering experiences no one else can. And third, we believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time. We believe we have the right strategy to deliver growth and value for all stakeholders. And we are excited to go into more detail about our plans. But first, let\u2019s do some level setting. Our purpose is unchanged and more relevant today this minute than ever. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is enduring, and we have honed our five-year vision. We personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. Technology is no longer a nice to have, it is a necessity, and it is expanding into all parts of our lives and homes. Working has forever changed. Streaming content has exponentially grown. The metaverse is coming to life. We can power our homes with connected solar panels. Cars are connected. And we can monitor our health, including connecting with the physician from our living room. Every aspect of our lives has changed with technology. And we uniquely know how to make it human in our customers\u2019 homes right for their lives. For example, we will send a consultant to your home for free to optimize the tech you have or have the tech you want. We can repair your phone screen and you can try VR headsets while you wait. You can meet with a fitness consultant in our virtual store, who will match your fitness goals with our fitness products, or you can use our Lively device to connect with a carrying center agent, who can help you schedule a lift. These are just some examples, and you\u2019ll see this come to life in many more ways throughout our presentation this morning. From a financial perspective, we delivered remarkable results over the past two years, and we are far ahead of where we expected to be when we set our long-term financial targets back in 2019. As I mentioned earlier, in the past two years, we have delivered more than $8 billion of revenue growth and improved our operating income rate by 110 basis points to 6%. We are in a strong position to drive the business forward and deliver growth. We do not, for one minute, believe we hit our peak revenue and margin this past year. As Matt outlined, we do expect fiscal \u201823 to look different as the industry cycles the last two years of unusually strong demand. And we leverage our position of strength to continue to invest in our future. But in fiscal \u201825, we expect to deliver revenue growth and expand our operating income rate beyond what we reported in fiscal \u201822. As we have always said, in order to deliver these financial results, it is paramount that we stay focused on our goal to remain a best place to work and we continue to deepen relationships with our customers. As you can see, our new fiscal \u201825 targets are materially higher than what we thought just back in 2019. We now expect to generate approximately $1 billion more in operating income than our original targets. Given our margin rate, this is considerable growth in operating income. So, what\u2019s changed since 2019? Well, the CE industry is larger than we expected. Our online mix has nearly doubled. We have found ways to make our operating model more flexible and efficient while also investing in wages and benefits. We are accelerating our category expansion. And we have launched an entirely new membership program. On the flip side, the financial contribution from Best Buy Health is clearer, but also a bit longer term than we had originally modeled. This is based on primarily two things. First, demand in active aging business and product constraints were impacted by the pandemic. Additionally, based on our internal learnings and insights from consumer behavior changes over the past two years, we tuned our strategy to focus on the growing virtual care opportunity, which Deborah will discuss in more detail later. As we think about our strategy going forward, it is important to look at how dramatically our business has evolved over the past several years. Here, we use fiscal \u201815 to give a longer-term view to what a different business we have become. Most of these changes were already in motion before the pandemic and then accelerated significantly in the past two years. Let me expand on a few points here. I already mentioned our fiscal \u201822 online business was 34% of our domestic sales. That is more than $16 billion in sales compared to just $3.5 billion in fiscal \u201815. When you look at how we use our stores for fulfillment, the increase in the sheer number of products customers are picking up in our stores is impressive. This is even more meaningful, when you consider the fact that our delivery speed is industry-leading, and we cut the delivery speed essentially in half over the past several years. Clearly, customers value our stores and the convenience and choice they provide. As Damien is going to discuss, we are increasingly interacting with customers via digital channels, like chat and video and in their homes. And finally, membership is incredibly important, both now and into our future. Our Totaltech membership is a big theme of today\u2019s presentation. But don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that we were a pioneer in loyalty programs. And our My Best Buy program now has more than 100 million total members. So, with all of that as background, I\u2019d like to tap back to our first key takeaway. Technology is a necessity, and we are the unique tech solutions provider for the home. So, let\u2019s start with some industry context. The traditional CE industry is large and growing. There is no perfect external source that tracks our business. So here, we\u2019re showing a historical view based on selected government PCE category data. Our outlook is based on multiple industry forecasts and internal data. As you can see on this chart, the industry was growing for several years and then accelerated during the last two years. As Matt mentioned, we expect it to step back this year as the industry absorbs the very high growth of the past two years. By fiscal \u201825, we believe it can be back to fiscal \u201822 levels, which is materially higher than it was pre pandemic. In addition, we\u2019re expanding our addressable market by entering new categories in areas like health and electric bikes that are being disrupted by technology in a good way as well as areas where we can really complete solutions for customers, like indoor and outdoor living. Jason will provide a bit more detail on these in a few minutes. As a reminder, this is also a stable industry. Contrary to some sentiment, technology is no more volatile or cyclical than other large durable goods categories over time. And the last two years have significantly underscored the importance of technology in day-to-day life. What historically was seen as a want has become a need. 40% of Americans use digital technology or the Internet in new or different ways compared with before the pandemic. And the use of telemedicine is triple what it was in just Q1 of 2020. The majority of people who started or increased activities like online fitness, telemedicine, videoconferencing and connecting socially with others virtually say they plan to continue this increased usage even after the pandemic. Terms like home nesting and virtual care have been invented to describe what all of us know so well, that where we work, entertain, receive health care and connect has changed, and our homes are now central to our lives more than ever before, and they\u2019re also more tech connected than they ever have been before. As a result, there is an overall larger installed base of consumers using technology. People own more tech devices than ever before. This combination of more devices and more activities also means customers need their tech to work seamlessly every day. True tech support when the customer wants it underpins living this way and is our unique asset across all these devices. And technology is extending in all aspects of our home, and we\u2019ve all grown to depend on it. This is not a hit-driven category. It is an industry that is need-based, stable and has been growing. We firmly believe people will continue to use technology more and both need and want to replace or upgrade their products. Billions of dollars of R&D spend by some of the world\u2019s largest companies and likely some we haven\u2019t even heard of yet, means innovation is constant. And that innovation drives interest, upgrades and experimentation into the future. This is not a static industry. So, to talk about this exciting world of technology innovation, I\u2019m honored to welcome Jason Bonfig, our Chief Merchandising Officer. Jason Bonfig : Thanks, Corie. Good morning. We continue to lead the tech industry with significant high-share and high-consideration categories. What I mean by a high-consideration category, generally higher ASPs in a longer period of time from when you start to think about purchasing to when you actually purchase. Continuing to grow our share in these large categories like televisions and computing will always be a cornerstone of our strategy. But to be truly there for our customers and all their technology needs, we need to accelerate our share across other areas of technology as well and also some new spaces. This is where Totaltech comes in. Products with lower ASPs and shorter upgrade and consideration cycles, our share is generally lower. Totaltech creates a new value proposition that benefits customers when they consolidate their technology shopping at Best Buy. I want to give three examples of a customer journey that illustrate this point. Let\u2019s start with a customer that actually wants to upgrade their kitchen. They want to buy an entirely new kitchen suite with three pieces. That customer that has Totaltech does not have to worry about delivery and install. It\u2019s included in the price. That could be between $400 and $500 value. A little bit later in the year, the same customer hypothetically breaks their phone. They want to get a new iPhone. When they purchase that iPhone at Best Buy, AppleCare is included. Just in the first year, that\u2019s just under $120 of value. Then a little bit later in the year, they want to get a new pair of wireless headphones. If you purchase those headphones at Best Buy, the warranty is also included and you\u2019re a Totaltech member. That\u2019s a $30 value. Examples like these is where Totaltech benefits come to life for our customers and create a reason to make a considered visit to our app, our website, our store, and increases Best Buy share across all of the categories on the slide behind me. Technology innovation never stops. And even when you look over the past three years, you can see value of the new technology and what it creates for our customers. During the pandemic, the majority of the focus was around creating products to meet customer demand. This was a distraction, but even with that, there was significant innovation and value created by our vendors. The slide behind me highlights an upgrade over a three-year period of similar price points across laptops and televisions. While I won\u2019t hit on every new feature and advancement that happened, I\u2019ll highlight a few. For televisions, you get a full 10 inches more in screen size, almost no bezel and the ability to navigate your TV with voice, if you\u2019d like to. On the laptop side, you can log in with your face. It\u2019s faster, thinner, lighter and has significantly longer battery life. These continued evolutionary innovation cycles are never ending, and they drive growth. They create reasons to upgrade and unlock new and better experiences for our customers each and every year. In fact, when we look at our customers\u2019 behavior, we\u2019re seeing a 7% to 15% reduction in the amount of time it takes a customer to get back into a category. They\u2019re coming back to categories faster because of these innovations by our vendors. I\u2019ve highlighted how Totaltech and our vendor innovations will drive growth. Now, I\u2019d like to highlight some macro trends that will also drive opportunities in our business. I\u2019ll start with 5G and fiber. The expansion of speed and networks in general are really, really good for customers and technology. You can download a movie in minutes, collaborate with others instantly, excess a video game or video content anywhere you want without latency. These are things that will drive new experiences and growth for our customers. The next trend is the metaverse and cloud, have virtual experiences, play golf with friends or family members virtually, travel to places that you actually can\u2019t and have a full experience in the virtual world. In addition to that, when you look at the virtual world and cloud, there are new experiences that are created. Previously, you could just play a game on a gaming system and your television. Now you can take that same game seamlessly from the system, to your phone, to your tablet. In fact, if some of you have children like I do, you\u2019re constantly battling the ability for them to play anywhere they want, anytime they want. The cloud also solves significant customer pain points. Previously, our customers would tell us when they wanted to upgrade a computing product, it would take them 60 minutes to get it the exact way they\u2019d want to. That would be moving their icons, their data, just getting it the way the old one was and having the features of the new. Today, with cloud, you\u2019re simply putting your credentials and in 10 to 15 minutes, it\u2019s actually exactly the way you want. You get all the benefits of the new technology and you get all of the placement and all the setup of your old product instantly. That does drive upgrade and it drives interest in customers in upgrading more frequently. The next trend I\u2019d like to talk about is automation and support. The connected home has been around for years, and it\u2019s now moving into automation and support more specifically. Single-function devices like robot vacuums today, tomorrow, they\u2019ll move into security of the entire home, communication and assistance for individuals. This is very, very important as our population ages and people want to stay in their homes longer. Automation and support is one of the ways where technology can enable people to just do that and accomplish their goals and solve that pain point. Next, I\u2019d like to talk about customization and personalization. Customers have always wanted to express themselves, and technology is not excluded from that. But there has been significant advancement in manufacturing from appliances to cell phones where customers can express themselves with a touch of color, a family photo or any other type of personal expression that they\u2019d like to integrate into the products. Sustainability is also a significant trend that\u2019s important to customers, but also very important to Best Buy. I\u2019ll start with a vendor example. Samsung televisions that we sell in our stores today have what is called Samsung solar cell technology in their remote controls. This eliminates the need for batteries, which is obviously very beneficial to the environment, but it also charges off of not only solar, but ambient light in the home. And it means that you\u2019re never going to have a remote that\u2019s out of power. That solves a significant customer pain point. Technology like this will expand to more and more categories and drive upgrade cycles. In addition to that, we want to make sure that we\u2019re supporting customers that want to upgrade more frequently. Today, you see that come to life with our recycling and trade-in programs, which are a very important part of our value proposition to customers. Over time, that will start to move into new usage models that may actually be upfront conversations about exactly how long a customer wants to use a product, and when that next upgrade will happen? Will it be a year? Will it be two years, or will it be three years as we move forward? Let\u2019s watch the video highlighting many of the areas I\u2019ve talked about and even some new additional areas that will drive growth. [Audio/Video Presentation] Jason Bonfig : I\u2019d like to thank our friends at Samsung for that assist in that demo. As we look over the past decade, we\u2019ve had over $12 billion in sales growth with the vast majority coming from large categories like TVs, computing and appliances, and one-third coming from new categories like wearables and VR, just to name a few. As we move forward, that innovation will continue and there will continue to be new categories that don\u2019t even exist today. We\u2019re also looking to accelerate that expansion by entering new categories that are aligned with where our customers want us to be in places where Best Buy can solve real customer pain points. For the next 12 to 24 months, we\u2019ll continue to focus on these five areas of expansion. I\u2019ll go a bit deeper on three of these : fitness and wellness, outdoor living and personal electric transportation, in the next few minutes. I\u2019ll start with fitness and wellness. This is a $34 billion industry that we are uniquely positioned to compete in with our blue shirts, but also our large product fulfillment network that was built for televisions and appliances. Our assortment has grown by 650% in the last 12 months, and we are implementing a larger, more premium experience in 90 stores over the next 18 months with dedicated zones for vendors. Damien will touch on the virtual store a little bit later, but customers today actually have the ability to have a virtual chat or video consultation with a fitness expert. The next area I\u2019d like to talk about is personal electric transportation. This is a $3 billion industry with rapid growth. We\u2019ve introduced 250 new products this holiday with 500 additional accessories around those products. We\u2019ll be adding physical assortment to 900 stores and a more premium experience in 90 stores over the next 18 months. We currently offer assembly, and we\u2019re in the pilot stages of service and support and repair for our customers. The last category I\u2019d like to highlight is outdoor living. This is over a $30 billion industry, and our acquisition of Yardbird, a leading premium outdoor furniture company, provides the ability for us to accelerate this business across a nationwide network. That acquisition, combined with our strength in outdoor television and audio, and new partnerships with leading brands like Traeger, Weber and Bromic, create a comprehensive solution for our customers. When we couple that assortment with our home consultants, and the physical and digital experiences that we\u2019ve developed for customers, this is a really, really fast-moving category that has the ability to grow. You\u2019ll start to see Yardbird products as fast as this spring in Southern California market, and we\u2019re very excited about that. To reiterate, we expect growth from Totaltech, consistent innovation from our vendors, macro trends that I\u2019ve mentioned, new product categories that we don\u2019t even know about yet and five new areas of expansion to move our business forward. Thank you. I\u2019ll hand it back to you, Corie. Corie Barry : Thanks so much, Jason. Obviously, you are the expert. Back to our second key takeaway. We have built a unique ecosystem of customer-centric assets, delivering experiences that no one else can. Consumer electronics is a distinctive industry. The products are constantly evolving. They\u2019re connected to networks that are constantly evolving. They all use different operating systems, and they range from small and powerful to large and breakable, often at high price points. And customers are more comfortable using tech than they have ever been yet. They also admit it\u2019s likely not doing all it could to make their lives better. Against that backdrop, we have built a unique ecosystem of assets that all work together to create a stickier and more valuable relationship with the customer. And we\u2019re investing in this ecosystem as we pivot against a backdrop of even higher customer expectations. We\u2019ll provide more depth on a number of these assets through the rest of the presentation. So, anchoring this ecosystem is our expert advice and service. Customers are excited about tech and want to be confident in their purchase. We provide that in ways literally no one else can, from our expertly curated assortment to in-home consultations, all the way to tech support when your tech isn\u2019t working the way you want or trade in the recycling when you want to upgrade. And then building on that strength, our Totaltech membership ties these experiences together and provides unique benefits that customers value and no one else can provide. We then combine those unique experiences with our strength in omnichannel retailing, industry-leading and seamless shopping experiences and services across all channels, including in-home, in-store, digitally, remotely and virtually. And finally, all these interactions provide us rich data and insights across customer experiences to create personalized technology solution tailored to the customer-specific technology and needs. And all this data fuels our business, like Best Buy Ads, matching our partners\u2019 marketing to the most appropriate audiences based on our first-party data. When this ecosystem works together, it provides a unique experience tailored to the customer. It also reaches beyond our consumers into business partners, suppliers and other strategic relationships that leverage our capabilities. Whether it\u2019s our consultative services highlighted on partners\u2019 websites or vendors leveraging our in-store pickup to fulfill from their websites, others value our capabilities. So, let me add some color around the first part of the ecosystem. As I said, customers are excited about tech and want to be confident with their purchase, particularly when it\u2019s part of their daily life at home. So, instead of me trying to describe all the parts and pieces to you, I think this video does an excellent job bringing to life the unique ways we provide expert advice and services, seamlessly across all our touch points. [Audio/Video Presentation] Corie Barry : So again, just to reinforce, there is no one else that can provide this type of immersive experience at scale in a world where more and more of our lives are being lived in a way that requires technology. And we felt it was important to double down on our unique capabilities with an equally unique membership offer. This represents literally years of customer research and innovation and truly puts the customer at the center of our investments. Matt talked earlier about the financial implications of our new membership program. Now, I get to talk about the fun part. Fundamentally, Totaltech is designed to provide our customers complete confidence in their technology, buying it, getting it up and running, enjoying it and fixing it if something goes wrong. Matt and Jason already mentioned some of the benefits. But as a reminder, Totaltech includes product discounts and periodic access to hard-to-get inventory, free delivery and installation, free technical support, extended warranties on products and much more. Because the membership is so comprehensive, it has broad appeal among our customers. There is truly something for everyone. And the benefit that\u2019s most appealing can vary based on a customer\u2019s unique shopping journey or their stage in life. So, let me share some early examples. I say early because as a reminder, we literally just rolled this program nationally in mid-October. The benefits associated with purchasing products like product warranty and member pricing are being leveraged the most. Younger generations are using these benefits, especially AppleCare at a higher rate than older generations. This is exciting and important, as extended warranties as a stand-alone business was definitely not a growing part of our business or strategy. And additionally, it\u2019s exciting that our employees have embraced this offer, realizing the suite of benefits means there is something in it for every customer. This makes for a more comfortable and natural sales environment and allows the employees to truly focus on the customers\u2019 needs. The VIP access to phone and chat support and access to Geek Squad support and services in general are used more often by older generations, which are legacy plans over-indexed on. And the access to hard-to-get inventory is resonating with some of our most engaged customers who already interact and spend with us very frequently. That broad appeal is one of the main reasons we rolled out this program. We have significantly elevated the customer experience by packaging up unique benefits our customers value that no one else can provide. And by doing so, we believe we have made it inconceivable for them to purchase their tech anywhere else. From a business perspective, of course, the goal is to increase customer frequency and capture a larger share of CE spend. As a specialty retailer, our customer frequency has a different profile than mass merchants. As a result, it is even more crucial that we stay in the consideration set as customers are building out their technology solutions. I am incredibly happy to say that we are indeed seeing increased interactions with our Totaltech customers to the tune of about 60%. Also, when we look at NPS surveys, specifically from customers who are Totaltech members, they are running about 1,400 basis points higher than nonmembers. From a spend perspective, it\u2019s difficult to calculate with precision, given the early stage of membership and our historical customer frequency. But we currently believe customers who sign up for the membership are spending about 20% more than they would have if they did not have the membership. We already have 4.6 million members. Now to be transparent, we auto converted 3.7 million Totaltech support and other legacy support programs. We have actively enrolled more than 1 million members since launching nationwide in October. And we see a path to double the number of members by the end of fiscal \u201825. This membership program is a vital addition to our customer relationship ecosystem, providing an offer that no one else can and interaction data that is incredibly valuable to all aspects of our business, fueling our growth over time. And to deliver this offer seamlessly, we leverage another part of our ecosystem, omnichannel retailing strength. To provide more depth on the evolution of our omnichannel retailing model, I am pleased to welcome Damien Harmon, our EVP Omnichannel, to the stage to talk to you about how we are optimizing our workforce, reimagining our physical presence and leveraging technology. Damien? Damien Harmon : Thank you, Corie. It\u2019s great to be here with you today to talk about our accomplishments and our plans for this year and beyond across our omnichannel portfolio. As Corie mentioned earlier, omnichannel retail is a critical component of our strategic ecosystem. It\u2019s the most direct way to connect our strategy to the needs of our customers and employees. Let\u2019s look at the last two years before we dive into where we\u2019re going. These last two years have challenged our employees in ways we could have never imagined. Powered by our strategic investments, we were able to serve our customers\u2019 needs and grow the business. There are two areas I want to highlight. First, the connection between our online sales, which expanded to 34% of our total domestic revenue and the 150% growth we\u2019ve seen in our virtual interaction across video, chat and voice. Today, 84% of the Best Buy customers use digital channels throughout their shopping journey. These virtual opportunities have created new ways for us to offer customers the immediate ability to shop with an expert wherever they are. Second and also connected to our customers using digital channels throughout their shopping journey is we\u2019ve seen a 72% growth in customers who are using our app while in our stores. This also creates an opportunity for us to build more digital interactions and technology-related solutions to support their needs. These numbers are amazing. We could not be more proud of our teams and how they deliver. Just as importantly, it gives us an incredible foundation for continued growth and optimism as we look to the future. Now from an omnichannel perspective, we look at the combination of customer experience, loyalty plus operating efficiency. The two main drivers of that and what I\u2019m going to talk about today are how we optimize our workforce and reimagine our physical presence in ways that serve our customers\u2019 needs in an ever-growing digital world. Our focus is on further developing our teammates to give them the skills to help customers inside and outside of our stores, but more importantly, through any number of digital channels that at our customers\u2019 fingertips. At the same time, we will optimize our store portfolio. And as Matt mentioned, we will maintain the trend of closing 20 to 30 stores per year. However, with online penetration growing so rapidly in the last two years, we\u2019re making investments in our stores to provide a better, more seamless shopping experience as customers move from online shopping to visiting our stores to video chatting from their home. So, I\u2019ll start with our people. We have significantly improved efficiency and productivity of our store labor model. We\u2019ve seen a more than 100 basis-point improvement in store domestic labor expense as a percentage of revenue compared to FY20. We\u2019ve also materially increased store productivity over the past two years. We\u2019ve done this by reskilling our teammates and making investments that lean into physical and digital shopping experience. A few examples include our fulfillment improvements, consultation labor and our virtual store. This allows us to leverage our employees more effectively inside and outside of our stores. The great news is that as we\u2019ve made these adjustments, we\u2019ve maintained a strong NPS in our stores. These investments in our people have allowed us to help them learn new skills, grow their careers, gain flexibility and realize their dream by keeping them with us longer. We\u2019ve increased our average wage rate 20% in the last two years by raising our minimum wage to $15 an hour and shifting some of our employees into higher skilled, higher paying roles. In fact, our average wage for our field employees this year will be over $18 an hour. Since we started our flexible workforce initiative in 2020, 80% of our talented associates are now skilled to support multiple jobs inside and outside of our stores. And we\u2019re proud of the fact that our fill turnover rates remain significantly below retail average and are near our pre-pandemic turnover rates. Overall, we\u2019re in a place we like right now. We\u2019re becoming more efficient without losing sight of delivering amazing experiences for our customers and our employees. We\u2019re going to continue to strike the balance between spend and productivity as we look at the factors that I just outlined. Now, an obvious differentiator for our workforce is our Geek Squad team, which continues to deliver an experience that creates repeat customers. We have nearly 21 million services interactions across in-store and in-home services. We\u2019ve significantly expanded our repair capabilities in categories that are important to customers [Technical Difficulty] helped us produce fantastic NPS results in-store, in-home and through our remote support. And after we complete the repairs, customer spend one times more [Technical Difficulty]. In fact 35% of our mobile phone customers are new or reengaged with Best Buy. This is enabled by a technical workforce that has an average tenure of almost nine years and a retention rate an 86%, no-one can match that level of expertise at the scale we can. That\u2019s huge. That team here has helped us produce fantastic NPS results. In-store, in home, and remote areas, customer spend 1.7 times more and engage 1.6 times more often across all Geek Squad services. Geek Squad will be a viral part of our Totaltech initiative, and we\u2019ll continue to offer standalone services that matter to customers, deepen those relationships and drive frequency. Our customers are also leveraging our expertise through consultations as well, both inside and outside of our stores. These consultations provide a direct access to customers for an ever-growing set of experts. Employees who have the skill sets to complete a consultation has grown by 78% last year. And with each consultation, we can inspire what\u2019s possible. Customers spend 17% more across their lifetime value, and they purchase more often when engaged for a consultation. Customers are loving this experience, and we\u2019re seeing strong NPS. When surveyed, 92% of customers say they will likely continue working our expert. And when customers engage with one of our consultations or designers, they shop with Best Buy 2 times more frequently. So looking ahead, we believe our annual consultations will grow by more than 200% by fiscal \u201825. As you saw earlier, we had 45 million virtual interactions across all channels, creating opportunities to engage our customers differently. We\u2019re excited about our virtual store, which just launched last fall. To date, our virtual store in comparison to historical chat experiences is generating higher close rate, higher sales and a 20% improvement in customer satisfaction. And that\u2019s not all. Our vendors are extremely excited about it as well. We started with 17 vendors on board, and we will end fiscal \u201823 with over 60 vendors investing in our virtual store. This is an investment in us and the belief that we\u2019re creating a totally differentiating experience. We\u2019re expanding our virtual store and adding more categories like appliances and home theater. And we expect our virtual sales interactions to double by fiscal \u201825. So, let\u2019s talk about ways we are reimagining our store in support of our physical and digital shopping experiences. We are very excited about the things that we\u2019re testing, learning, in some cases, implementing in our stores. First, let\u2019s talk about experiential store. In 2020, we launched a test in one of our Houston stores and added two additional locations since then. Some of the key enhancements include dedicated showcase spaces for some of the new categories Jason mentioned earlier, like e-transportation, outdoor living, fitness. We expanded our Microsoft and Apple shops and dedicated more space to premium experiences like appliances, home theater and audio. We expanded our Geek Squad presence for more customer interactions and space for repair services. And we\u2019ve also enhanced the fulfillment capabilities to include exterior lockers, additional space with shipping, packing and fulfilling from our store warehouses. And we\u2019re excited about the performance. We\u2019ve seen a 370 basis-point improvement in NPS. We\u2019ve seen a steady lift in customer penetration in the retail trade area as well as overall customer spend. And we expect to continue to see strong revenue lift in these experiential stores, and we will remodel 50 locations in fiscal \u201823 and about 300 locations expected by fiscal \u201825. Now, I want to highlight our 16 outlet stores that are open-box clearance, end of life and otherwise distressed large product inventory across major appliances and televisions, which might otherwise be liquidated at a significant lower recovery rate. These outlets unlock value by alleviating space and capacity from our core stores, and they are an important element of our circular economy strategy by providing a second opportunity for products to be resold instead of ending up in the landfill. In FY22, gross liquidation recovery rate is almost 2 times higher than alternative channels. These locations are attracting new and reengaged customers. 16% of customers are new and 37% of customers are reengaged. In FY23, we will double the amount of outlet stores, and we\u2019ll test expanding our assortments by adding computing, gaming and mobile phones. As we discussed last year, we launched a test in Charlotte of a new holistic market approach. And as I mentioned earlier, the ways people are shopping today are entirely different than how they shopped two years ago, and our stores and the way they operate need to change and adjust accordingly. This work in Charlotte is a manifestation of this shopping evolution, and this pilot leverages all of our assets in a full portfolio strategy across stores, fulfillment, services, outlets, consultation labor, and we bring it all together with our digital app. Within the test, we are looking at how a variety of store formats across 15,000, 25,000 and 35,000 square feet locations can serve customers\u2019 needs. And this summer, we will be introducing a 5,000 square-foot store into the marketplace. When you look at the before and after map of the Charlotte market, you can see we have reduced our overall square footage by 5% and yet we\u2019ve increased our customer coverage in the marketplace from 76% to 85%. We\u2019ve also added 260 access points, where customers can get their gear and employee delivery covers nearly half of the metro. So looking ahead, we\u2019ll be focusing on using this market to learn in fiscal \u201823 before we make decisions on what to scale or what not to. Technology enhancements are at the center of many of the changes I just mentioned, from self-checkout to virtual store, technology supporting our teams and customers in new and exciting ways. Take a look at this video to see what we\u2019re doing. [Audio/Video Presentation] Damien Harmon : As we can see, technology brings it all together in support of our optimized workforce and how our physical locations will enhance the shopping experience inside and outside of our stores. We\u2019re excited about this year and our future as we focus on the combination of customer experience, loyalty plus operating efficiency. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to our President of Best Buy Health, Deborah Di Sanzo. Deborah Di Sanzo : Thank you, Damien. Here is the ecosystem slide Corie and Damien shared, and it\u2019s a perfect introduction to Best Buy Health as our work is an excellent example of the Best Buy ecosystem and flywheel. Today, I will share the strategy of health at Best Buy. But first, let\u2019s see it come to life in this video. [Audio/Video Presentation] Deborah Di Sanzo : I hope the video begins to answer the question that I hear often, \u201cWhy in the world is Best Buy in health?\u201d I understand the question because health is complex. It has a longer return on investment, and other companies have not succeeded. So why will Best Buy succeed? We didn\u2019t build this strategy to be like any other company or to change who Best Buy is. We built our strategy on Best Buy strengths, our world-class omnichannel, distribution and logistics, strong analytics, presence in the home and our empathetic caring center agents. Our strategy is supported by the rapid consumerization of health and two significant trends. First, Technology is moving into health. We recognize an $80 billion market opportunity for health technology and the desire for consumers to use technology to manage their health. And second, health is moving into the home. By 2025, an estimated $265 billion in Medicare services will move into the home, and 61% of patients say they would choose hospital care at home. And Best Buy has long proven we\u2019re a trusted advisor for technology in the home. 70% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a Best Buy store, able to shop health and wellness products, speak with our expert blue shirts and utilize our distribution hubs to fulfill their health technology needs. Geek Squad makes 9 million home visits annually, helping consumers set up technology and perhaps more importantly, teaching them how to use it. And we have the confidence of our customers and partners as we work to help enhance the health industry. Our strategy is to enable care at home, building on the strengths in three focal areas. In consumer health, we provide curated health and wellness products; in active aging, we offer health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home; in virtual care, we connect patients with their physicians and enable care at home. Our presence in each of these focal areas creates a flywheel where growth in one adds momentum to the other two. This is the strength of our story. Now, let us look at the customer journey. Jason touched on a few areas of consumer health earlier and our video introduced you to Angela, a 45-year-old mother and caregiver to an aging father. You saw her purchase a TytoCare home medical kit when her son was sick. And Angela can find countless other products to support the health of her family from weighted blankets to exercise equipment to blood pressure cuffs and more. These products not only support our customers and their day-to-day health but also serve as an entry to our other two focal areas, active aging and virtual care. Lively supports adults who want to age independently at home. Our easy-to-use phones and personal emergency response devices feature one touch access to our caring center and services like urgent response, fall detection and more, providing patients and caregivers with a peace of mind that care is only a call away. Last year, we launched our new Lively brand and a Lively partnership with Apple to feature our health and safety services on Apple Watch. And today, I\u2019m happy to announce Lively on Alexa, which will launch this spring. Our Lively monthly subscription service provides a consistent revenue stream. And last year, we drove 15% year-over-year growth by adding 348,000 new lives served. Our caring center agents connected with our customers over 9 million times last year, offering a variety of health and safety services. So, let\u2019s jump back to Angela\u2019s story. Angela worries about her father living at home alone, so she purchases a Lively smartphone and an Amazon Echo for her dad from Best Buy, along with a monthly Lively health and safety subscription plan. Jacob uses his Lively Smart to request to lift drive to a doctor\u2019s office through a caring center agent. He has a minor fall at home and uses his Amazon Echo to alert the caring center, who can follow protocol to determine if emergency medical services are needed. And this patient journey is just one example of the many ways Lively supports active aging adults at home. Now let\u2019s look at virtual care. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, perhaps the most exciting opportunity lies within virtual care, where we enable patients to connect with their care teams. In November, we acquired Current Health. Current Health is making inroads into care at home through securing strong partnership -- strong partnerships with successful programs at Baptist Health, Mount Sinai, AbbVie, the Defense Health Agency and more. Our acquisition merges Current Health\u2019s FDA-cleared at home platform with Best Buy\u2019s scale, expertise and connection to the home. Together, we create a powerful virtual care experience. Jacob is in the hospital with [indiscernible]. The hospital physician identifies and enrolls Jacob into the hospital\u2019s hospital-at-home program. Best Buy sets up Jacob\u2019s home with the technology needed for remote patient monitoring and trains both, Jacob and Angela on how to use it. This ensures the hospital physician can focus on treating patients rather than being a tech consultant. This is a job that physicians had to play during the pandemic, and it overtaxed our health system. At home, Jacob is monitored by Current Health\u2019s platform and a virtual command center. The hospital physician checks in daily with video visits to ensure he\u2019s healing on track. The command center coordinates Jacob\u2019s home medications and notices a lack of data from his monitor. After discovering that he\u2019s improperly wearing the device, Geek Squad is deployed to a system. The platform\u2019s algorithm alerts the command center that Jacob has a persistent fever and the on-call health system physician prescribes therapeutic, which is delivered by the pharmacy partner. When Jacob recovers, the hospital physician discharges Jacob, and Jacob continues to be supported by Lively. A few of the pieces in this patient journey are still in development. The Geek Squad integrated with Current Health, for example, but this is our direction. And you can see Best Buy is there for the patient with technology, support and connections to enable care at home. And we\u2019re not building this alone. We\u2019re creating an ecosystem to support consumers and their care-at-home journey. Consumers are at the heart of our strategy, and throughout a lifetime of health needs, Best Buy is there to help enrich and save lives through technology and meaningful connections. As I mentioned earlier, our health opportunity creates a flywheel, driving growth in all three focal areas. Our revenue in fiscal year \u201822 was $525 million. We\u2019re growing 35% to 45% a year, and we are accretive in fiscal year \u201827 as the health industry has a longer return on investment. Thank you for your time, and I\u2019ll turn it back to Matt. Matt Bilunas : Thank you, Deborah. You\u2019ve heard details from Corie, Jason, Damien and Deborah about some key areas that give us excitement about the opportunity in front of us. We firmly believe our differentiated capabilities and focused investments will lead to compelling returns over time. While fiscal \u201822 was certainly an amazing year, we see a path to even higher revenue and earnings by fiscal \u201825. And as we look beyond fiscal \u201825, we see even more opportunity for revenue growth and operating income rate expansion as the benefits from our initiatives like Totaltech and Best Buy Health grow even further. Before I share additional details on our fiscal \u201825 targets, I would like to review a few guiding behaviors that have been our brand for several years. First, we plan to fund our growth through the cash we generate and return excess cash to shareholders. Second, we are committed to leveraging cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures in our business. Our current target set at 2019 is to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal \u201825. We achieved approximately $200 million during fiscal \u201822, picking our cumulative total to $700 million towards the $1 billion goal. Let me take a moment to reflect on our past performance. We have talked about our record results over the past couple of years, but it is also important to note that we have had very steady growth in the years leading up to the pandemic. This past year was the eighth straight year of comparable sales growth. In addition, we have expanded our operating income rate, earnings per share and ROI. Earlier in the presentation, we shared our fiscal \u201825 targets, so I won\u2019t cover them in detail here, but I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes on our fiscal \u201825 assumptions. We expect our revenue in fiscal \u201825 to be in the range of $53.5 billion to $56.5 billion. This range reflects a three-year compound annual growth rate of approximately 1% to 3%, despite the anticipated decline in sales in fiscal \u201823. I would also note that due to expected store closures, our comparable sales CAGR would be approximately 2% to 4%. There are a few key assumptions underlying the revenue expectations. First, as Corie shared, we believe the consumer electronics industry will remain significantly higher than it was pre-pandemic, and we expect that fiscal \u201825 will be back to a level similar to fiscal \u201822. Second, we believe we have an opportunity to capture even more market share than we have in the past. This is due to growth from Totaltech and the store initiatives that Damien talked about. As it relates to Totaltech, we believe that the combination of membership revenue and incremental purchases by members will add approximately $1.5 billion in revenue by fiscal \u201825 compared to fiscal \u201823. This is a net impact. So, it incorporates the impact of cannibalizing other standalone services now part of our membership offering. Of course, we also expect revenue growth from Best Buy Health and the expansion into additional categories that Jason shared earlier. As we move to our fiscal \u201825 operating income rate outlook, we expect to expand our rate to a range of 6.3% to 6.8%. As we have highlighted, Totaltech is currently pressuring our fiscal \u201823 operating income rate. Health has also been an area of investment for us over the past few years. However, as each of them scales, we expect them both to meaningfully contribute to our fiscal \u201825 rate outlook. We also see opportunities to lean in even further on capabilities like our in-house media business, Best Buy Ads, which as Corie mentioned earlier, is fueled by our first-party data. We expect this business will benefit our fiscal \u201823 operating income with benefits increasing in the out years. In addition, we expect to see rate benefits from our continued focus on finding cost efficiencies that benefit both, gross profit and SG&A. Damien highlighted a number of strategies that are part of this effort. As we\u2019ve discussed over the past few years, technology will be critical in unlocking many of these opportunities. Of course, there are areas where we will likely see pressure on our rate in the future. The first example of this is pricing. Throughout most of the pandemic, the level of promotions in our categories has been well below levels of fiscal \u201820. This has been largely a result of higher demand and more challenged or constrained inventory environment. We have seen pockets of promotional activity increase over the past two quarters, and our belief is that the promotions will continually progress back to fiscal \u201820 levels. A second area I would highlight is increased spend in technology in our store portfolio. As we have shared over a number of quarters, our technology spend has been increasing in support of our initiatives and overall omnichannel experience. In addition, we expect more depreciation expense from our capital investments in our stores. Lastly, there are a few other factors we will continue to assess, but at this point, don\u2019t see as being a material to our rate in fiscal \u201825 compared to fiscal \u201823. First, from a store labor standpoint, we expect to maintain expenses at a similar rate of revenue. We will continue to invest in higher pay for our employees, but expect to balance the higher wages to efficiencies, leveraging technology and more flexible workforce. Second, we do not expect channel mix to have a material impact to our rate. As Damien shared earlier, our outlook assumes closing 20 to 30 stores per year through fiscal \u201825. This assumption reflects our belief that the online channel mix will grow approximately to 40% in fiscal \u201825. We will continue to apply a rigorous process for lease renewals to ensure we are comfortable with the financial return and overall customer experience. Currently, the vast majority of our stores are cash flow positive, and we believe are essential for us to serve our customers. I\u2019ll move next to our cash flow and our capital allocation approach. To start with, we have been generating healthy levels of free cash flow for several years, which provides us ample room to fund our growth investments. Our average annual free cash flow over the past five years is more than $2.3 billion. Our capital allocation strategy has been consistent for several years. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive growth, highlighted by the strategies you\u2019ve heard today. This includes both, capital expenditures and operating expense investments. Next, we may explore additional partnerships and acquisitions if we believe they will accelerate our ability to achieve more profitable growth. We also plan to continue to be a premium dividend payer and return excess cash through share repurchases. Let me quickly expand on a few of these areas. We expect our annual capital expenditures to increase to a range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion over the next three years. Earlier, Damien outlined a number of changes to our stores to further our strategy. Consistent with our iterative approach, we will test, learn and deploy once we have vetted anticipated returns of our initiatives. Technology investments are expected to remain similar to fiscal \u201823, simply decreasing as a mix of our capital deployment. This morning, we announced a 26% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.88 per share. Our targeted dividend payout remains in the range of 35% to 45% of prior year\u2019s non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Lastly, this year marked a record level of share repurchases at $3.5 billion. In fiscal \u201823, we plan to spend approximately $1.5 billion on share repurchases. So, with that, let me turn the stage back over Corie. Corie Barry : Thank you so much, Matt. Extraordinary ecosystems have formed over the pass 20, 30, 40 years as digital has transformed every aspect of how we all do business. That same transformation is happening our homes, meaningfully accelerated in the last two years. And while we started as a music retailer, selling fun to have products, we\u2019re now the only company built around the same extraordinary transformation of technology in our lives and in our homes. While others sell some of the same products we do, we alone offered the complete technology solution across manufacturers and operating systems. We are the only company in all channels and at scale that can do everything from design your personalized hardware and software solution in home, to install and connect all of it, to keep it working when there are any issues from unreliable networks to broken screens. These assets appeal not only to our customers but they are also unique and investable for our marketing partners, technology vendors, small business and education relationships and other strategic connections. As we look to the future, we see technology as a permanent and growing need in the home, constantly evolving as the world\u2019s largest companies innovate with new use cases around the metaverse, transportation, green electricity and health, just to name a few. We have a unique value creation opportunity into the future and are investing now as we\u2019ve successfully invested ahead of change in our past to ensure we pivot to meet the needs of our customers and retain our exclusive position in our industry. We are excited to help customers enrich lives through technology in ways no one else can. And with we will break for 10 minutes before beginning our Q&A session. [Break] Corie Barry : Welcome back. We are excited to begin the Q&A portion of our event, which we expect to run approximately 45 minutes. But before we do, I want to take this opportunity to introduce and welcome Mark Irvin, our new Chief Supply Chain Officer. Many of you spent time with Rob Bass and may know that he recently announced that he is stepping away from a life in retail to pursue some other passions, as we have been discussing for quite some time. We are so excited for him and thank him for his incredible work on our supply chain transformation. That incredible work extended to his ability to bring in top tier talent. One example of that is Mark Irvin, who came to Best Buy in 2013, specifically to work with and learn from Rob. Mark has been an instrumental part of the team that has led our supply chain transformation and is ready to use his lifetime of knowledge in the space to continue to advance our industry-leading supply chain efforts. We are thrilled to have Mark Irvin taking over the reins in supply chain. And we\u2019ve invited him to join us for Q&A. So, operator, we are now ready for our first question. Operator : Thank you, ma\u2019am. Your first question is from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Mr. Chris Horvers, your line is now open. Moving on to the next question, Mr. Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Hey. Hopefully you can hear me and hopefully my mugshot doesn\u2019t stay on as Chris\u2019s. Okay, great. So, my first question is on the industry outlook. So, you\u2019re effectively saying that the industry will revert or digest in \u201822. And I want to make sure I understand that in \u201823 it starts to grow. Can you talk about why does it grow, why doesn\u2019t this revert for two years, given the consumption growth we\u2019ve had? I assume it\u2019s having to do with the innovation and shorter replacements. But, why doesn\u2019t that begin in \u201824 as opposed to \u201823? Corie Barry : Yes, I\u2019ll start and maybe Matt can add some color. I think that what we\u2019re looking at is, as you said, a little bit of a step back in the next year as we lap some of the stimulus. But, I think, there is a number of factors and we outlined some of them in the prepared remarks that we believe will continue to boost the inventory as we head to the other side of next year. So, some of the things that we cited, first of all, you have this real phenomenon where technology is all over our homes, and we are very dependent on that technology and this nesting factor being in our homes is a very sticky behavior. And that\u2019s because secondarily, a lot of what we\u2019re doing is leveraging tech and people are saying they expect to continue to do that, things like streaming or learning or obviously, all of us probably in some way, shape or form, hybrid working. Those are really -- gaming is another great example. Those are really sticky behaviors that we continue to expect to see over time. And not only that, now you\u2019ve got 2 times as many connected devices in the home as you had two years ago. So, you have this proliferation of devices. And because the innovation cycles are continuing to ramp, we\u2019re also seeing in most of our key categories that replacement cycle already start to shorten. We could literally see it in the last two years in our customers that replacement cycle is shortening. And so, while we think there\u2019s a bit of a step back next year, all of this massive interest in the industry, the new ways that people are using technology, the innovations that are happening in spaces like metaverse or some of the things that Jason talked about in his prepared remarks, all of those, we believe, start to create that ramp as we get on the other side of a little bit step back in the next year. Simeon Gutman : Okay. And maybe as a follow-up to Totaltech, this will just have a couple of pieces, but I promise it\u2019s all Totaltech related. Any quantification of the impact to the EBIT or EBIT dollars in \u201822 or fiscal \u201823? Can you share what you think or expecting or modeling for renewal for year one of Totaltech? And then, you mentioned you\u2019re seeing 20% lift in some of the early sign-ups. Is there a danger or risk you\u2019re basing that off of the period of very good consumption when there was stimulus money hanging around. So, how are you confident that\u2019s a good level to think about going forward? Corie Barry : Yes. I\u2019ll start maybe and then Matt can talk a little bit about the EBIT. On the renewal, we haven\u2019t come out with renewal rates. The good news is they continue to be in line with our expectations. So, we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019re seeing from a renewal perspective, but we do want to give that a bit of time. I think to your second question around the period of time that we\u2019re using. First, we\u2019ve been overt in saying it is a short period of time. We just rolled this out in October, but we wanted to at least give some color on what we\u2019re seeing. Second, while you\u2019re right, this is a unique period of time, we\u2019re comparing it against a control group in the same period of time. So all of the behaviors that we comparing -- because what we\u2019re looking at in that 20% lift is a lift in people who purchased and are using Totaltech versus those who would not or had not purchased it. And so, you\u2019ve got a comparative group there. So, both behaviors in theory should be different. But still, it\u2019s holiday, like we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s a short period of time. We wanted to give the initial color, and then we\u2019ll keep watching that as we go through the next year, obviously. Matt Bilunas : Sure. And maybe just to adjust the overall impact to EBIT next year, we talked about the OI rate being at 5.4% and last year ended at 6%. That decline is mostly coming from our gross profit rate decline. And the majority of that gross profit rate decline has been -- is due to the Totaltech membership rollout. As you know, we launched the membership in Q3 -- at the end of Q3 last year, and we don\u2019t cycle that until Q3 of next year, FY23. So, that majority of that gross profit decline is coming from the Totaltech launch, to give you a general size of the impact. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Chris Horvers : Thank you. Clearly, I need some Totaltech support there. So, I guess, my first question is a bit of a follow-up. You talked about a 2% to 4% CAGR over the next three years. If you\u2019re down at the midpoint, it looks like you\u2019re embedding, if -- check my math, roughly like a 5% comp in the out two years. And if you look back 2015 and 2019, you sort of did a 3%. So, a two-part question is, first, what drives the confidence in that? And then, the second part of it is, are you assuming share gains in core categories, like PC and TV? And to what extent is the contributor from these new opportunity categories that you\u2019ve talked about? Matt Bilunas : Yes. Thanks, Chris. Yes. So essentially, you\u2019re right that roughly, as we think about our path to FY25, FY23, we talked about it being down as the industry is assumed to be in the low single digits to mid single digits. As you move to FY25, that would assume a higher pace of growth in those couple of years, not necessarily being linear, but a little higher pace of growth than we have historically. What gives us confidence in the ability to do that is a lot of the initiatives that you heard today. So, we\u2019ve outlined a number of things, Totaltech changes to our stores, expanding our assortment, growing into Best Buy Health. Those things give us confidence in being able to accelerate our sales as we look out past FY23. What\u2019s assumed in that number as well is essentially, we would expect to still modestly gain share on a baseline of our business but then be able to accelerate our share growth with these initiatives that we talked about and then expand our markets with the items that Jason shared and also Best Buy Health as well. Chris Horvers : Understood. And then, my follow-up question is any further cadence commentary on the top line? Obviously, you got a couple of years of stimulus here in the first quarter. Is it fair to think that 1Q is the low point in the year? And if you hit the midpoint of the range, or is your expectation that in the fourth quarter you could flip to the positive? Matt Bilunas : Yes. So, what we outlined was a minus 1 to minus 4 comp for FY23. We also talked about how the weight of that decline is in the first half of the year. So, you could assume that something maybe towards the bottom end of that range for -- or a little worse on first half of this year. So, you could imagine any number of outcomes as you look at the back half. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Karen Short : [Technical Difficulty] these other elements that are going to flow into the P&L. But wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you think the actual four-wall margin structure will do in the time period from today until fiscal \u201825. And then, I had one other follow-up. Matt Bilunas : Yes. I\u2019m not sure I caught the entirety of the first part of that question. But, in terms of the store four-wall operating rate in the future. We would expect to continue to find efficiencies in our store operating. Damien outlined a number of things that we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s also important to know that the store is connected to the broadness of how our whole business works from an omnichannel perspective, whether it\u2019s the store, our digital presence, our chat or virtual sales that we\u2019re now engaging in. So, we\u2019re always going to find ways to create efficiencies. Obviously, there are some levels of inflation in fixed costs within our stores that we\u2019re always choosing to navigate, but we would expect that there\u2019s still opportunities for us to continue to drive a better outcome on the store side from a profitability standpoint. Corie Barry : Karen, I just want to underscore, it is incredibly difficult for us to separate the performance of the stores from digital performance from what Matt was alluding to virtual and call. And if you think about Q4 alone, 65%ish of what we sold online was either picked up in stores. That was about 45%, or shipped from a store. That was about 20%. And so, when you have that amount of crossover, literally -- I mean, it\u2019s the best example of like true omnichannel behaviors with our customers. Piecing those things apart is incredibly difficult. Understand, what we\u2019re trying to do, to Matt\u2019s point, is really build in effectiveness and efficiency across those. So, you create those real frictionless experiences for customers. You have both the convenience, but you also have that amazing experience when they want it. Karen Short : No. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I\u2019m just curious, with respect to the Charlotte test, any color or metrics you can give on the overall margin, I guess, and/or sales lift in that store? I realize that there\u2019s a decline in sales floor square footage. But, any timeline on unrolling that out to other markets? Corie Barry : Yes. I\u2019ll start and maybe Damien can add some color. We aren\u2019t yet providing any of the metrics on performance. And that\u2019s because it still is, A, relatively new, and B, this is how a bunch of stores are working together. And I just want to underscore back to the first question that you asked. The beautiful thing about Charlotte is we\u2019re really trying to say, what do our stores need to do in the future. Obviously, our online penetration has doubled in the last two years. And that means the role of the store is different. The store is incredibly important. It showcases all the experiences. It is the cornerstone for convenience. And as Matt said in the prepared remarks, more than 99% of our stores are cash flow positive. So, in and of itself, the stores are amazing experiential moments with our customers. And we know that the role of the store will continue to evolve. And what we want to make clear with Charlotte is this is a market now with the same quantity of stores before and after. But, you have 24% less selling square footage, 100% more warehousing and fulfillment and an overall reduction in square footage of 9% in the market. But, you also have consultants going into home. You have more access points than ever, and you cover the market, about 41% of it, with employee delivery. And so, what you\u2019re trying to do is create a bigger draw in the market for more customers because you just have all these different experiences. Damien, I don\u2019t know if you have anything you want to add? Damien Harmon : The only thing I would add is, traditionally, we\u2019ve looked at one store at a time and how that particular store can create an experience for a customer. Now, you\u2019re looking at the full portfolio, all of our assets in a particular geography, and you\u2019re finding ways to be able to navigate that customer experience and what they\u2019re expecting across a multitude of different experiences. I think, that\u2019s what\u2019s really important is, we\u2019ve never done that before because it\u2019s been in each individual store. Now being able to say across a 15,000 or 25,000 or a 35,000 square-foot store in an outlet experience and our consultation labor, we can take care of that customers\u2019 needs across the board, and our teams are working across the stores. Our teams are working across different customer expectations and really delivering a unique experience in that marketplace. And we\u2019re continuing to learn over time, and then we\u2019ll apply that as we see what\u2019s working best for us or what\u2019s not. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : I guess, I\u2019d like to start on understanding a little bit more about the pricing commentary that you made in your outlook for the next couple of years. And if we look at just average unit size versus number of transactions last year, could you give us that? And then, help us understand as you get that 2% to 4% comp, how much of it do you expect from ASP as opposed to transactions? Matt Bilunas : Sure, I can start and then Corie can jump in, too. If I look just outward towards our FY25 goals, we talked about how we\u2019ll always need to be price competitive in our business. So, that is fundamental to how our consumers want to interact with us and to the market. And so, we\u2019ll always make the right decisions to be price competitive and create value for them. If I think about what happened this last quarter in terms of ASPs and units and transactions and thus last year, on a year-over-year basis, a lot of our growth and most of our growth is coming from ASP increases, which was coming from a couple of different avenues. So, premium mix is up. That\u2019s the majority of our ASP increases. Secondly, we have some pricing increases from what we\u2019ve been seeing from inflation, but the majority is that premium mix. Transactions and traffic were down in the quarter, as you would imagine from a sales -- the sales decline. But it\u2019s important to note, too, if you look all the way back into our history, ASPs have been increasing year after year after year. There\u2019s an interesting dynamic happening in our organics, which can distort the view of organics in total. We\u2019ve been seeing actually unit and transaction growth and ASP growth in our higher ASP areas like computing and appliances and televisions. Where we\u2019re seeing the unit declines and transaction is on the very low ASP items, things that have been shifting over to the digital mediums like gaming software or music or movies. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s creating some of the dynamic on the units and transactions. So, we really like the fact that our units and our ASPs are growing in those areas where we can really create a better experience for our customers in totality. I think, you addressed next year. Next year, I think we don\u2019t plan our business based on ASPs and units and transactions. We would continue to expect, though, that as our business shifts and we start -- you see our Totaltech offers and our better experiences start to take hold that our ASP and our premium mix would continue to grow and provide a better solution overall, but also be able to add in some of those lower ASP items as we continue to create a better experience holistically. Greg Melich : Great. I\u2019d love to follow up on that a little bit on the Best Buy Advertising. Is that more of a revenue opportunity or a margin opportunity? And how important is it? Is that basically selling ads to current vendors, or are there opportunities more broadly? Corie Barry : Yes. I\u2019ll start. I think that there are broad opportunities in the Best Buy Ads business. Obviously, we have what we would call audiences or kind of suites of customers and information about those customers that\u2019s certainly very valuable to our vendors, which is where we over-index right now but can be more valuable broadly to other partners who might be looking for potential consumers who have the kind of same look and feel as our consumer base. And so, while we start kind of near in with those who really understand this unique customer that we have and the unique knowledge we have with that customer, everything from service interactions to purchase interactions to how they decide to use the approximately, all of these are important behavioral points that are important, not just to our vendors, but ultimately, probably to a wider swath of partners. I don\u2019t know if you want to hit on how the financials. Matt Bilunas : Sure. The Best Buy Ads business, for now, it\u2019s -- most of that\u2019s coming through our current vendors. And when that\u2019s the case, what it does, it actually drives margin rate is recorded as an offset to cost of sales. So overall, when you take that in addition to the SG&A required to drive it, it does create an OI rate positive experience for us, but it is more of a rate offset in margin. To the extent we drive more sales with people that aren\u2019t our vendors and we go outside of our ecosystem, that actually would then show up into revenue in the future. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : First thing I wanted to clarify is that picture is not a catfishing situation that I actually do look very similar to that right now as we speak. So, I just wanted to clear that up. But, in terms of my actual questions, I guess, you mentioned that the promotional -- promotions did increase year-over-year. And obviously, that\u2019s kind of a -- it sounds like it\u2019s a sort of end of pandemic type of normalization to some extent. I guess, my first question is, I guess, were promotional levels relative to the fourth quarter, I guess, 2020? Matt Bilunas : Yes. I\u2019ll start and maybe Jason can jump in after that. Compared to FY20, some of our categories actually did start to get close to or back to FY20 levels in Q4. So, there were places we saw more promotionality in Q4 on a year-over-year basis and as it relates back to \u201820 where things like computing, headphones and wearables and even TV started to get back to levels close to FY20. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been seeing some of the more promotions in this last quarter. We actually saw computing start to be more promotional on a yearly basis back in Q3. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019re starting to see. And you\u2019re right, as we look to FY23, we would expect more and more categories to start to return to more normal FY20 levels based on how inventory starts to flow. There are some still inventory things we\u2019re watching in terms of the chipsets and some supply constraints. But as inventory starts to normalize and get into next year for more categories, we would expect more of them to return to levels closer to FY20. Anthony Chukumba : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up. And you talked a little bit about this in the press release. Just even directionally, what was the impact from, I guess, supply chain issues, product availability issues on your fourth quarter results? And what do you expect the impact to be, even just directionally on your F 2023 guidance? Matt Bilunas : Yes. We did see some pressure from freight warehousing in Q4. It wasn\u2019t as material as some of the other things we\u2019ve talked about. So, we are seeing higher rates come through just the transportation and carrier mix of what we\u2019re having to supply. It was offset a little bit by a parcel reduction. So overall, there was a little bit more pressure in Q4. As you think about next year, we are expecting to see freight warehousing continue to be a pressure as we continue to move through the year, not as material as some other things that we\u2019ve laid out, but it would be something that we\u2019re going to continue to navigate over the next number of quarters. Corie Barry : And Anthony, I think the other part of your question was around the inventory levels that we saw in Q4. And we haven\u2019t sized it specifically, but I think it\u2019s fair to say we would have been healthy in our range, had we not had some of those very targeted -- and again, I want to be clear. They\u2019re very targeted inventory constraints that were just a bit larger than we thought. And I think we expect to see some of those continue into, especially the first half of next year and again in a more targeted way. But our overall inventory situation, I think that\u2019s some of what you\u2019re seeing in the promotional environment, our overall inventory situation is very healthy. I mean, they are year up 6%, 15% versus two years ago. So, it\u2019s just these pockets where we\u2019ve seen more demand, so that\u2019s good, but a little bit more constrained than we were expecting. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Best Buy has a long history of doing what it says it\u2019s going to do, setting realistic expectations and then following through on those expectations. If you do get some feedback or there is sentiment coming out of this event, it might be that you set really aggressive targets over the next few years, especially on the profitability side to put some perspective around that. The midpoint of the 6.3% to 6.8% operating margin expectation would be 50 basis points better than what Best Buy\u2019s ever done in the past, and that was during a pandemic. And get to the midpoint, Best Buy will be able to achieve 50 basis points of annual operating margin in fiscal \u201824 and fiscal \u201825, whereas prior to the pandemic, it was generating about 20 basis points of annual operating margin expansion. So, as you look out, what\u2019s changed about the model to make it more -- that much more profitable than Best Buy has been in the past? Is it really healthcare, advertising? You\u2019ve been able to master the profitability of the online business? And as part of that, could you talk about the contribution from Totaltech, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Health and cost reductions inefficiencies, would they all equally contribute to the profitability expectations a couple of years from now? Matt Bilunas : Sure. I\u2019ll take that from a couple of different angles, Michael. First, I\u2019d say, over the last couple of years, this team you see on the camera, everyone in the building and the field have been doing amazing job just navigating and accelerating a number of the strategies to lift our business and improve the profitability over the last couple of years managing through the pandemic. There is certainly a number of things we\u2019ve changed about our operating model that has allowed us to navigate very easily through store channel to an omnichannel to now a virtual channel and the chat situation. So, the team has done an amazing job just finding ways to efficiently operate this business, and that\u2019s helping us drive profitability now and as we look forward. And we\u2019ll continue to do that. As you look to the out years in terms of profitability, we have been -- we\u2019ve been talking about investments in areas like health and technology. And now we\u2019re talking about investing in our stores. All those things are intended to pay back, not just payback from a sales perspective, but also continue to improve from a rate and an operating dollar and an operating rate perspective as well. So, they are, as we\u2019ve laid out in our materials, ways we\u2019re going to help expand our rate from FY23 up to the range of 6.3% to 6.8% in FY25. We believe those initiatives will help generate more profit -- being more accretive over time. And at the same time, we\u2019ll keep working hard to make -- create the efficiencies in our stores and navigate through the different channels very seamlessly. We\u2019ll never stop trying to find those improvements. And this team has been hard at work doing that. Corie Barry : Michael, I think you have stacked -- and you actually nailed and laid out a lot of them. But you have this kind of stacked quantity of things that both have happened and that we\u2019re investing in. I mean, we have tremendously more scale than we had just two years ago with $8 billion added to the top line. And obviously, that -- majority all coming through are digital experiences. So, we\u2019ve navigated a massive change in the composition of our business. Under that, we\u2019ve also created material efficiency and effectiveness because I think it\u2019s really important to note, we also noted in prepared remarks, in Q4, we saw some of our best NPS results, particularly on the in-store side of things, our teams are doing incredible work garnering skills. 80% of our associates have more than one skill, which allows us to move this labor really flexibly and allows really interesting career paths. So, you\u2019ve got scale, you\u2019ve got a really efficient and effective model that now has moved through this changing dynamic. And then, we\u2019re layering on top distinct initiatives that we have expectations around return. Totaltech being one, the ads business being another, the health business that we\u2019re investing in for our future, the store experience side of things, all of these. We are using behavioral history that we\u2019re seeing in our customers to help us predict how we think this model looks in the future. And I would just underscore what Matt said, I give the team a great deal of credit for choosing to double down on these investments now because we do think this is what unlocks exponential growth for us as we head into the future. Michael Lasser : That\u2019s helpful perspective. My follow-up question is, embedded in your guidance for the next couple of years is it looks like a mid-single-digit comp for the domestic business. If it proves that it\u2019s more like a 3% top line growth for the domestic business from 2024 and 2025, can you still get to the 6.3% to 6.8% operating margin, or should we think more like a 6% operating margin in that scenario? Matt Bilunas : Yes. Certainly, the ranges we gave from a revenue and OI perspective have those ranges on all the initiatives and various components of our plan. So, we would continue to strive for those targets that we gave for operating rate income, despite maybe coming at the bottom end of that scale. There\u2019s obviously a range when come to the initiatives, but also just the work in our baseline or business to create efficiency. So, we would continue to target that even if it was towards the lower end. But obviously, we\u2019re going to make the right decisions for the long term. So, we\u2019ll always choose to invest as we need to along the way. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin from R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : So, getting to the margin, I was wondering if you could give us like cadence. Obviously, you\u2019re going to be down to the -- this year but then sharply up in \u201824 and \u201825. I mean, is it balanced between those two years, or is it mostly expected in \u201825, the improvements? Matt Bilunas : Yes. So, we haven\u2019t given the numbers for FY24. So, obviously, we\u2019re giving us up a little bit of flexibility in how we get to the FY25 goals, not just in terms of the lines of P&L, but even the years as well. We would expect to see improvements each year, if you will, the general size is we haven\u2019t actually sized for anyone, but we wouldn\u2019t expect to see improvements as we progress in each of the years going forward. Scott Mushkin : Okay. And then, my second question is, obviously, on the revenue side, there\u2019s some pretty ambitious targets. I think, Michael was talking about that a second ago. But, I was wondering, you\u2019re obviously attacking new areas and new categories. When you think about the comp, how much is coming from those new areas? And how much is it increasing your addressable market? I know you threw $300 million out there. But, is your market now actually going to be bigger than that as you attack new areas for the business? Matt Bilunas : Yes. We didn\u2019t size the -- expanding our assortment within the numbers. We gave some indication for some of the other areas that if you go from the mid-range of FY23 to FY25, that\u2019s about $5 billion. Totaltech was $1.5 billion of that number, and that includes the cannibalization of the standalone services and offerings that we have. We also talked about how health is at $525 million today and that we\u2019re going to grow at a high CAGR rate over the next number of years that would indicate that by FY25, it\u2019s about $900 million of growth, too. So we\u2019re breaking those parts out. What\u2019s left is what we would expect to expand in our -- from our categories and our physical assets. So, we would expect those to provide some meaningful growth as well as the other items. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. Peter Keith : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll also echo a great presentation today. First question I had was just around Best Buy Health. We\u2019ve been talking about this, I feel like for about five years. So, it seems like we\u2019re making some progress. But I was wondering if you could also kind of look back in terms of what hasn\u2019t worked that you\u2019ve learned and discontinued versus what you\u2019re leaning into more aggressively as you see future opportunity. Corie Barry : Maybe I\u2019ll start with a little bit of context, and then I\u2019ll ask Deborah to come in since she came in partway through the journey. I think it\u2019s maybe not as much about what -- maybe what didn\u2019t perform as well. I think it\u2019s what we\u2019re learning about a consumer that has changed a great deal, particularly in the last two years. So, some of those early hypotheses we had around health moving into the home, around people wanting to age in their homes with technology, I think those hypotheses were actually exponentially sped up over the last couple of years. And, we started to see some new use cases around virtual care in particular. So, I think, we felt like we were pointed in the right direction even three, four years ago. It\u2019s just that the consumer behaviors have really changed in the last two years, having gone through the pandemic. And now we\u2019re refining our focus a bit so that we really target where the industry is going. Maybe Deborah, you could add some color. Deborah Di Sanzo : Corie, I think you pretty much covered most of it. I think I would just say, in the active aging space, we -- people will continue to actively age in their home, live independently in their home. If you think about it, we target -- consumers are 65 years and older, and these consumers like -- actually, they like a physical store experience. So, that in the past couple of years, when our stores were closed, we couldn\u2019t go in. We couldn\u2019t see the phones. We couldn\u2019t see the personal emergency response devices. We really saw that pick up, though, in Q4 of this year. So, we are very optimistic about that market. And I just want to emphasize what Corie said, again, really in the pandemic, consumers thoughts of digital health changed dramatically. In the health technology space for about a decade, people have been talking about the consumerization of healthcare, but the pandemic really brought the consumerization of health care. So, now consumers want to take care of themselves and their family in their home 365 days a year. They do it with technology, and they need help with that technology. And I think that with Best Buy enabling them to connect with their physician, helping them with their technology is really what\u2019s driving our optimism in the market. Peter Keith : Okay. Thank you. Maybe another question, I would want to pivot over to Jason on some of the macro and product trends. Here again, 5G, we\u2019ve been talking about for a couple of years. It seems like it\u2019s starting to come to life; metaverse, maybe a couple of years out. Could you bring those to life for us a little bit more in terms of types of products you would expect to sell and how you might be involved from a services implementation as we think about product cycles in these areas? Jason Bonfig : Thanks for the question. 5G, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see happen at more of a market level. So, it will be almost a rolling change as it hits the individual markets and the potential for that additional speed is unlocked with customers. That shows up not only in products, but it also just shows up in the ability to make more connected products, the expansion into things like tablets, watches, laptops to really take advantage of that faster connection. The other area is metaverse is very, very much alive, and we\u2019re seeing the trends with our customers. When we look at VR, our VR business grew double year-over-year in Q4, but actually also for the entire fiscal year of FY22, showing the customer interest in wanting to experience the metaverse, want to try some of the different things from a virtual reality perspective. And the amount of products and the amount of customers just will continue to evolve as they find more and more ways to take advantage of the technology that\u2019s going to just continue to expand experiences for customers and the ability to plug into these new networks and new experiences as we move forward. Corie Barry : And Peter, to your question about services, this is so interesting. Because what we\u2019re seeing is this really high level of interest and yet confusion around what it is and what I do. I just read a survey that said that 70% of consumers age 65 and older want to try VR experiences, but aren\u2019t even sure exactly where to start. And so, sometimes this is consulting services in the home. But sometimes this is as simple as having that wide array of products from all of the vendors and just being willing to help people kind of dabble into, whether it\u2019s metaverse or 5G, which becomes really relevant as we\u2019re talking about getting out of our homes actually, and being on the go and being able to game and work and learn on the go. So, I think for us, this is long continuum, all the way from coming to the store and we can just help you understand what this is, all the way to, now I have twice as many conducted devices in my home. I want to learn how to leverage a 5G network and maybe get off Wi-Fi. How do I do all of that? And I think over time that -- again, from our unique point of view, that\u2019s where we can be helpful to the consumer. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zack Fadem : Can you help us bridge the gap from your current gross margin profile of 25.5? And help us understand what\u2019s embedded in the 6.5% EBIT margin target? And specifically, could you walk us through the expected Totaltech drag in 2023? How that\u2019s expected to normalize? And how we should think about the other moving parts mixing around new categories and promo, et cetera? Matt Bilunas : Sure. So overall, for FY23, we\u2019ve talked about how the majority of that step back is -- in operating rate is driven by the Totaltech launch that we did in FY22. And so, we cycle that at the end. And so, what\u2019s essentially happening is the -- what used to be higher services gross profit rate is now being impacted by the launch of Totaltech, which is a much more complete offer. So, it includes product warranties, installation, things like that. So, the gross -- services gross profit rate is coming down, if you will. What we\u2019re doing though is driving more members much faster than we did in our previous service membership and driving more product incremental sales. The standalone offer is actually profitable on its own but we\u2019re navigating this period of time where we\u2019re cycling a different services offer and also building and scaling the incremental sales of the offer itself. So all that takes some time, and we\u2019re not necessarily pointed towards a gross profit rate or an SG&A rate. We\u2019re looking at driving OI rate over time and OI rate dollars over time. And so, we haven\u2019t given guidance over that period from FY25 because we\u2019re obviously going to give our self a little bit of flexibility as we navigate a very new offer in Totaltech as we understand just the incrementality and the frequency, but also just the usage. So, we haven\u2019t given those -- the breakouts of the different. We will also expect gross profit expansion in other areas, though. So, health has a very healthy gross profit rate. Best Buy Ads also has the ability to drive gross profit rates. There are things that help us mitigate what might come from a lower services gross profit rate in the future. Zack Fadem : And on that OI rate expansion from 5.4 to 6.5 in 2025, it suggests a 100 basis-point improvement over a two-year period. Is it fair to assume that that will be evenly distributed in \u201824 and \u201825, or are there certain drivers or initiatives that are more weighted towards the front or back end? Matt Bilunas : Yes. We haven\u2019t given the -- we\u2019re not going to give the exact breakout by initiative. But all of them are contributing to that OI rate expansion from \u201823 to the targets we gave for FY25. There are a lot of moving parts. But each of them, the initiatives of health and Best Buy -- or Totaltech as well as Ads, those are all contributing to the growth in the operating income rate. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Securities. Scot Ciccarelli : So, I had a healthcare follow-up. I think in response to Peter\u2019s question, you guys were talking about an acceleration of consumer need for aging employees, et cetera. But I think your business has actually ramped slower than expected. So, what do you think the impediments have been to faster adoption? Is it the value equation? Is it an awareness issue, et cetera? And then, what can you do to accelerate the adoption of your healthcare services? Deborah Di Sanzo : Scot, thank you. Thanks so much. I\u2019ll take that. So, think about it this way. First of all, the health presentation that we presented today is a bit different than the strategy that you saw previously. So, this is really one strategic area, three focal points,, taking advantage of the rapid consumerization of healthcare, which did really not exist before two years ago. Second, we continue with active aging. People still do want to live healthy and happy and independently in their homes. And the third area of virtual care is also an era which essentially did not exist before the pandemic. Now hospitals want to have hospital home programs. They want to take care of helping people get better in their homes where they are surrounded by loved ones and feel comfortable. And so, hospitals all over the country are really putting in hospital at home programs, putting in chronic disease management programs. These are growth areas that did not exist before. Our focus before was in active aging. And as I said in my prior remarks, those are consumers 65 years and older and for our products, so the active aging products, they really appreciated a physical store experience. And so, when we had different hours in the last 21 months, when we had some store closures, it did impact the active aging business. But we see it now really -- we had a very strong Q4, and we see that continuing. Scot Ciccarelli : Okay. Thanks. And then, a quick housekeeping item. Matt, given the economics of the Totaltech program, if membership actually grows faster than expected, does it take longer to kind of shift in the profitability mode? Matt Bilunas : Not necessarily. The growth in membership is indicative of the value of the offer, the interactions that they want to have with us. And so, we would see membership revenue grow, but also to the extent that members are growing, the incremental product sales that they would grow, would grow with that. So, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily impact the pace at which we could actually drive profitability. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Forbes from Guggenheim. Steven Forbes : I wanted to start with customer relationships event, maybe a topic from the last Analyst Day. So, Corie, if you can, really, if you frame where we are with those events across the various interactions and provide some high-level insight on how the relationship events over the past two years have or maybe amplify the business strategy that you laid out, supporting the upwardly revised targets? Corie Barry : Yes. So, if you go back to two, three -- two years ago, 2019, we talked about specifically these customer relationship events. And at the time, if you recall, we underscored things like using the app and having the app. We underscored at that point, Total Tech Support, which we\u2019ve now evolved into Totaltech obviously. We underscored customers who shop in multiple categories. They were like specific events that people who use our financial services. There were specific events that we were looking at that we said, when customers interact with us in this way, we tend to keep them in our ecosystem; they tend to spend more; they tend to be those more loyal customers. You can imagine, over the last two years, the good news is we have seen some acceleration in those type of events. We\u2019ve seen more app downloads. We\u2019re seeing a 72% increase in people using the app when they\u2019re in our stores, great. That\u2019s a great data point. We\u2019re seeing to what Matt just said, more people take up the Totaltech offering than we were seeing in total tech support, although that was still growing over the last couple of years. We\u2019re seeing more -- we just saw a whole bunch of new customers, and we\u2019re seeing those customers shop us in multiple categories. So, we\u2019re seeing that grow. I think you can see in the presentation that we gave today, it is still very important for us to continue to drive those customer -- deep customer relationships. And we\u2019re continuing to evolve how we see those interactions that are most important to those longer-term relationships and almost every strategy that we underscore today, whether it is what Damien talked about in terms of our more experiential stores, or whether it is Totaltech or whether it is a relationship with patient or someone we\u2019re helping to provide help for, all of those are the types of relationships that keep customers stickier to the brand. And given we talked a little bit, our frequency is a little bit lower than you can imagine, someone who has grocery or someone who has consumables. And so, this idea of increasing the frequency, staying relevant in the selection is really important to us. And that\u2019s, I think, what you can see all of the strategy is geared around those deeper and more prevalent customer relationships. Steven Forbes : That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a quick follow-up as we revisit the holistic market approach. Just curious what sort of incorporated around that strategy over the next two or three years in those longer-term targets that you laid out? Matt Bilunas : The holistic? Corie Barry : The markets. So, when Matt was talking about the capital guides that we kind of gave, you could see some of that increase in capital. At some point, we\u2019re assuming, and Damien talked specifically about the experiential stores, there probably will be some other store concepts that we may choose to roll. But, what I want to say is we\u2019ve been very clear that the Charlotte market is a pilot, and we mean that. Sometimes people say pilot and then they fully know exactly everything they\u2019re going to roll from there. It is a pilot. We are learning from it. And we assume that at some point, we will continue to roll pieces of that model. But, we\u2019re not yet ready to say this is exactly the concepts, exactly how many and exactly in what markets. Matt Bilunas : Sorry for the confusion there. Yes, we would assume there are some revenue impact and profitability impact from the broad work on our store portfolio, namely the experiential store rollouts that we\u2019re doing. And as we continue to look at the market approach, any other changes, we would include that into the revenue outcome as well. Operator : Your last question is from the line of Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. Liz Suzuki : Just a short-term one on the comp guidance. I guess, since two-year growth rates are starting to get thrown off by the start of COVID two years ago, do you think we should be looking at three-year growth rates as we think about the cadence of quarterly comp? Matt Bilunas : Yes. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to look at two years and three-year stacks of growth rates. I think, the best guidance for us would be if you look at the next year\u2019s guide of 1% to 4% and think about the first half versus back half. The first half is going to see a bigger weighted sales decline just based on the 37 comp we did in Q1 last year and then the 20 comp in Q2. How that works out exactly -- it won\u2019t necessarily be even from a three-year perspective or a two-year perspective. But if you think about a first half, back half for next year is probably the easiest way. And then, think about the overall guide of 1% to 4% and how that -- where they may land in that order. Liz Suzuki : Got you. And then, I guess, just to that point on kind of three-year growth rate. I mean, the implication from the guidance would suggest some reacceleration from the fourth quarter exit rate. So, can you quantify the impact of Omicron and the inventory shortages on that fourth quarter comp, and if you consider those sales to have been lost permanently? Matt Bilunas : Yes. We didn\u2019t quantify it. What we said is we believe we would have been pretty safely in the range of our revenue performance in Q4 if we hadn\u2019t had to reduce our store hours and if we had seen the level of inventory in certain products and categories that we were expecting. Some of that wouldn\u2019t necessarily be lost because people find that people do come back to us after maybe an attempt that they couldn\u2019t or if the product wasn\u2019t available. So, it isn\u2019t necessarily lost as you look into next year, but we do believe we would have been pretty safely in the range of revenue, had those two factors not happened. Corie Barry : Thank you so much. And with that, we will actually wrap today\u2019s investor event. And on behalf of our panelists and all of Best Buy, it has been our pleasure to share our progress with you, and we genuinely thank you for taking the time and all of your questions. Have a great rest of your day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal \u201823 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O\u2019Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Mollie O\u2019Brien: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our team\u2019s strong execution and focus on providing amazing service for our customers. Throughout the quarter, they navigated the uncertain macro environment and drove higher customer satisfaction scores while keeping energy and excitement going around the initiatives that we believe will drive longer term opportunities. We grew our Totaltech membership, increased momentum in our health business, launched new product categories and reached our fastest ever Q1 average online sales delivery speed. At our investor update in March, we said we expected our fiscal \u201823 financial results to look different. As we all lap stimulus and other government support, our industry cycles the last 2 years of unusually strong demand and we leverage our position of strength to continue to invest in our future. In addition, we said we expected promotional activity to increase and supply chain expenses to be a pressure. As such, we guided our annual comparable sales to decline 1% to 4% and our non-GAAP operating income rate to decline 60 basis points to approximately 5.4%. Therefore, the drivers of our Q1 financial results were largely as expected. Macro conditions worsened since we provided our guidance in early March, including higher inflation and the war in Ukraine, which resulted in our sales being slightly lower than our expectations and supply chain costs a little higher than we planned. Our investment in Totaltech at approximately 100 basis points of gross margin pressure was in line with our expectations and revenue from our credit card profit share was higher than anticipated. Overall, I am proud of our team\u2019s ability to develop and execute plans to adapt to the changing environment over the past 2 years and to the more recent macroeconomic conditions. Our revenue and profitability remained much stronger than they were pre-pandemic. Q1 revenue of $10.6 billion is $1.5 billion or 16% higher than Q1 of pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820. And while our non-GAAP operating income rate is currently being impacted by our investments, it is still 80 basis points higher than fiscal \u201820 even with those investments and supply chain pressures. Our enterprise comparable sales declined 8% as we lapped particularly strong comparable sales last year. The 37% comp sales growth in Q1 of last year was driven by the timing of government stimulus payments, lapping a quarter during which our stores were closed early in the pandemic and the heightened demand for stay-at-home focused purchases. From a category standpoint, the biggest contributor to the comp sales decline, were computing and home theater. Although down from last year\u2019s strong sales compared to Q1 of fiscal \u201820, our computing revenue has grown more than 30%. Our domestic appliance business, which has grown every quarter, except for 1 for more than 10 years, delivered comparable sales growth of 3% on top of 67% growth last year. We aspire to help customers with all their technology needs in the most seamlessly possible across all touch points and we are encouraged by the improvements in our customer net promoter scores. We have been leveraging our omnichannel strength to serve and support our customers as their shopping behavior and expectations have evolved significantly over the past 2 years. While customers have returned to physical stores to see and touch products and get advice, our digital engagement with customers remains very high. Our online sales as a percentage of domestic sales are 31%, still twice as high as pre-pandemic levels and revenue from virtual phone and chat interactions continues to increase rapidly. Additionally, we are expanding our engagement with customers in their homes as in-home consultations and in-home installations are up significantly. During the quarter, we saw higher NPS overall and we saw our highest ever NPS from in-store purchases and in-store services. I would like to take a moment to expand on the topic of inflation, important in the current environment. Like other companies, we have seen cost inflation in areas such as labor, marketing and supply chain. However, this cost inflation was largely in line with our expectations and benefited from planning and execution over the previous 2 years. As it relates to product pricing, we have seen an increase in our average selling prices over the past 2 years due to a number of factors. First, our product sales mix has changed as customers have mixed into premium products at higher price points. This has been happening for years and accelerated during the pandemic. Additionally, we have driven material growth in appliances, which carry high ASPs and have become a larger part of our mix. Second, there was overall lower promotional and markdown activity during much of the pandemic due to the shortage of product to meet demand. And third, our vendors are absorbing higher transportation and component costs and some of that has led to higher cost of goods sold for us. In many cases, we have passed through this higher cost of goods sold in the form of higher prices to customers. Importantly and fundamentally, we aim to be competitive in our pricing. We have seen a pickup in the promotional environment, as we have consistently noted, starting in July of last year. As we entered fiscal \u201823, we expected the promotional environment to create margin pressure in Q1 and throughout the year. In Q1, we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year. And some products were even more promotional than we expected coming into the quarter and were similar to pre-pandemic levels. Turning back to our Q1 results, our ending inventory was up 9% compared to last year and essentially in line with the growth of our revenue since fiscal \u201820. Our teams did an amazing job actively managing inventory levels as the quarter progressed in this evolving supply and demand environment. Pockets of inventory constraints still exist, but are currently isolated to certain products and vendors. Overall, our inventory remains healthy. Even though inventory availability in CE is much better than it has been for much of the pandemic, the supply chain continues to be challenging with ongoing transportation disruptions and higher costs including containers, labor and fuel. We are, of course, not immune to the supply chain challenges in the world today and we are seeing some impacts on our business. We have invested in many aspects of our supply chain over the last several years in ways that have helped us navigate the environment and mitigate the impacts. We have employed a portfolio approach as it relates to carriers, transportation partners and parcel delivery partners. And we have built deep relationships across our supply chain, including port carriers and deconsolidation operations. In addition, we strategically leveraged the use of both rail and over-the-road transportation modes to move product. All of this has helped us to drive capacity, avoid large-scale disruption and mitigate cost increases. Importantly, our contractual relationships have allowed us to limit our exposure to the more turbulent spot market. The strong relationships we have cultivated with our vendors have also been crucial to our navigation of the supply chain environment. Working closely with our vendors, we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process. Additionally, we actually handled transportation for many of our vendors, meaning we take control in Asia or Mexico. Then we have full visibility and control of the inventory movement and costs. We have invested in our distribution center network, effectively bringing product closer to customers and implementing technology solutions that increase productivity and speed to customer. We have also invested in our store-based fulfillment, including our ship-from-store customer fulfillment centers and implemented an effective employee delivery system. These investments have allowed us to make dramatic improvements in speed of delivery to our customers, even with the significant increase in volume in the past 2 plus years. In addition, we have many options for our customers to pickup their products themselves through in-store pickup, curbside pickup, lockers and alternate pickup locations. Customers clearly appreciate the convenience as the percentage of online sales picked up in stores has remained relatively consistent over the past several years at approximately 40%, even with the incredible improvements in shipping time. As it relates to ESG, we remain encouraged by the recent recognition of our work to support the environment and our community, both inside and outside Best Buy. We are proud to be included on Ethisphere\u2019s 2022 World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies list. We are one of only three retailers on it and it\u2019s our eighth time earning the honor. We were also included on the 2022 Forbes List of Best Employers for Diversity as one of the top four retailers on the list. It\u2019s our third consecutive year making the rankings that recognize leadership and commitment towards building a more inclusive workplace. During the quarter, we expanded our recycling program to include a new service for customers who are looking for our help recycling their large products. For a fee, we will go to customers\u2019 homes to pickup large electronics and appliances as well as an unlimited number of small products and ensure they are responsibly recycled and kept out of landfill. This service is in addition to our everyday recycling programs available at all Best Buy stores and our Holloway service with the purchase of new products. As I mentioned earlier our employees executed well in the evolving environment, in many cases making hard decisions to run the business effectively and prioritize our customers. Even with the expected slowdown this year as we lap 2 plus years of pandemic impacts, we continue to be in a fundamentally stronger position than we expected to be at this point. We are confident in the strength of our business and excited about what lies ahead. We have a compelling value creation opportunity and are investing now as we have successfully invested ahead of change in our past, to ensure we are ready to meet the needs of our customers and retain our unique position in our industry. As we provided a more detailed investor update in combination with our Q4 results on March 3, I am not going to outline all our initiatives, but would like to provide a few updates on our progress. In March, we spoke quite a bit about Totaltech, our unique membership program that includes member pricing discounts, product protection, free delivery and installation and 24/7 tech support. Fundamentally, Totaltech is designed to provide our customers with complete confidence in their technology, buying it, getting it up and running, enjoying it and fixing it if something goes wrong. During the quarter, we continued to sign up more members as customers realize the great benefits of the program. And we are encouraged by the higher engagement, customer satisfaction and increased revenue we continue to see from customers who have signed up to become members. We are pleased with the pace at which we are acquiring new members, especially considering the macro environment. We continue to see that Totaltech has broad appeal across customer segments. Additionally, we are improving our ability to gain members not only in retail stores, but in our digital and in-home channels. As a reminder, from a financial perspective, Totaltech is a near-term investment to drive longer term benefit. We expect year-over-year pressure on our gross profit rate to cease as we lapped the launch in October. And over time, we expect the incremental spend we garnered from members will lead to higher operating income dollars. Accordingly, Totaltech is a significant contributor to our fiscal \u201825 goals. As we outlined in March, we are optimizing our workforce and re-imagining our physical presence in ways that serve our customers\u2019 needs in our more digital world. We are making investments that provide a better, more seamless shopping experience as the customer moves from online shopping to visiting our stores to video chatting from their home. This includes our virtual sales strategy. Early in the pandemic, the volume of customers interacting with us via phone and chat skyrocketed. The volume has remained high and we are actively working to increase the sales opportunity of these interactions through a number of efforts. One, we are leveraging a team of expert sales associates working from their homes, many of whom have in-depth store experience and are certified in multiple categories. Two, we have staffed our virtual store with dedicated experts who can help you via video and demo a product just like they would in our store. And three, we are enhancing the training for our offshore call center agents to help them feel like confident salespeople. We are already seeing great results as revenue from these interactions more than doubled in Q1 compared to last year. Enhancements to our technology platforms are in progress to further streamline our operations and enable these employees to chat, video, text, share their screens and transact. With this, we will be able to accelerate the productivity and sales opportunity further. We have spoken quite a bit about our consultation service that provides customers with expert help and inspiration tailored to their unique tech needs often right in their homes. This is growing and important as we continue to see very high customer satisfaction scores and increasing spend by customers who engage with the consultants. We also have a team that is focused on providing tech products and solutions for businesses in specific industries, including homebuilding, hospitality and healthcare. We have been growing this aspect of our business for several years and more recent investments in our digital capabilities and fulfillment have led to strong growth momentum that we expect will continue. For example, Q1 revenue from this team was up 15% over last year\u2019s Q1 and up more than 70% from Q1 of fiscal \u201820. As I step back to comment on our overall workforce, we have been actively evolving the composition of our teams throughout the last 2 years as customer behavior changed and became even more digitally focused. The result is that our overall headcount is actually lower than pre-pandemic. We feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model, the demand we are seeing and the nature of our customer interaction. We will continue to learn, evaluate and evolve the model in light of the way the business and shopping habits are changing. At the same time, we have invested and will continue to invest in flexibility, training, compensation and benefits for our associates. We are incredibly proud that our field turnover rates remain significantly below the retail average and are near our pre-pandemic turnover rates. Additionally, our store general manager turnover is just 6%, meaning our GMs have the tenure and experience to effectively help their teams navigate this dynamic environment. It is clear that we have store managers who are invested in their employees, their career paths, their well-being and their communities, and I thank them for their dedication. Of course, as previously noted, we are also re-imagining our physical stores. This year, we expect to complete approximately 45 remodels to implement our experience store concept. We are excited about these remodels as we continue to see higher revenue and NPS in the pilot locations compared to the controlled stores, especially as one of the pilots has been running almost 2 years. We also continue to see strong results from our outlet stores and are on track to rollout more this year with new stores opening soon in Chicago, Houston and Phoenix. Our outlet stores assort open box, clearance, end-of-life and otherwise distressed large product inventory in major appliances and televisions that might otherwise be liquidated at significantly lower recovery rate. We tend to see twice the recovery rate of our cost of goods sold when we sell this product at our outlets versus alternative channels. Additionally, these locations can attract new and reengaged customers. Last year, we estimate that approximately 16% of outlet customers were new to Best Buy and 37% were reengaged Best Buy customers. In fiscal \u201823, we plan to double the number of outlets by opening 15 additional stores, and we are expanding our assortment beyond major appliances and large TVs to include computing, gaming and mobile phones. We are already seeing increased performance in these new outlet formats as customers gravitate to the expanded assortment. Finally, these outlet stores are an important element of our circular economy strategy by providing a second opportunity for products to be resold instead of ending up in a landfill. And another important element of this circular economy strategy is our trade-in program. We have an extensive trade-in program covering more major CE categories than anyone else. In Q1, we took in 135,000 trade-in units from customers. Not only does our trade-in program keep tech products out of landfills, our customers typically spend 3x the amount they received on their trade-in on new products at Best Buy. We are continuing our category expansion strategy as well. For example, we\u2019re helping customers commute more sustainably with a new lineup of the best electric bike scooters and mopeds. Over the next 18 months, we will be bringing a selection of these products to nearly every Best Buy store. We\u2019re also rolling out charging devices, perfect for our customers\u2019 garages in several stores. And Geek Squad can not only assemble the e-bikes for customers, but we\u2019re also beginning a pilot to test service and repair for e-transportation products in some of our stores. We also just recently announced further expansion into the health and beauty category by launching new skincare technology products online and in 300 of our stores. In our Best Buy Health business, we are pleased with our first quarter momentum. In Q1, we saw strong growth in new sign-ups for our active aging business that offers health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home. In our Emerging Virtual Care business, we connect patients with their physicians to enable care at home. Last November, we acquired Current Health, a technology company with an FDA-cleared monitoring platform for care at home to help us accelerate our strategy. The combination of Current Health offerings and our scale, presence and Geek Squad in-home capabilities is already resonating with the healthcare industry. Boosted by its affiliation with Best Buy, Current Health had its best commercial booking quarter ever, including expansion of its relationships with health systems such as Mount Sinai Health System, Parkland Health, as well as the UK National Health Service and others. I\u2019m excited to share that Current Health was awarded best hospital technology implementation in the 2022 MedTech Breakthrough Awards program for its role supporting health systems across the U.S. implement innovative care home programs. Current Health was also selected by Frost & Sullivan as the 2022 Company of the Year in the global virtual home care platform industry. In summary, I am proud of how much we accomplished in the first quarter and excited about what lies ahead for us. Clearly, there remains a great deal of uncertainty. On one hand, consumers still have relatively strong balance sheet, they continue to spend, wages are up and unemployment is at record lows. On the other hand, many consumers are lapping stimulus income they received last year and are also facing issues like higher gas and food prices, rising interest in mortgage rates, recession fears, stock market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine. Underlying all that is the gradual shifting of spend from stay-at-home purchases to more experiential spend on services and the activities, many were unable to enjoy during the pandemic. As I mentioned at the start of my comments, while the drivers of our results were largely as expected, the comparable sales decline of 8% was on the softer side as inflationary pressures heightened throughout the quarter. That trend has continued into the beginning of Q2, and it does not appear that it will abate in the near-term. Therefore, as Matt will outline, we are revising our guidance and now expect fiscal \u201823 comparable sales decline in the range of 3% to 6%. And we are correspondingly updating our non-GAAP operating income rate to a range of 5.2% to 5.4%. We will continue to proactively navigate this rapidly changing environment, balancing the day-to-day operations with our commitment to our long-term strategy and growth initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q1 and our outlook, I want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers in all our channels. I greatly appreciate your teamwork and perseverance. I love the Best Buy culture and our commitment to enriching lives through technology. And I will close by saying this. We firmly believe that technology is more relevant today than ever. Every aspect of our lives has changed with technology, and we uniquely know how to make it human in our customers\u2019 homes right for their lives. From our expertly curated assortment to in-home consultations, all the way to tech support when your tech isn\u2019t working the way you want or traded in recycling when you want to upgrade. We believe we have an ability to inspire and support customers in ways no one else can. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt. Matt Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. As Corie mentioned, we expected our Q1 financial results to be softer on a year-over-year basis. Our Enterprise revenue of $10.6 billion declined 8% on a comparable basis as we lapped a very strong 37% comparable sales growth last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.6% compared to 6.4% last year. If you compare it to the first quarter of fiscal \u201820, before the pandemic, our non-GAAP operating income rate increased 80 basis points. Our revenue growth has clearly played a role in our improved SG&A rate, but I would also like to highlight a few other factors. Our investment in Totaltech membership alone added more than 100 basis points of operating income rate pressure this quarter compared to the fiscal \u201820 period. We are also investing in Best Buy Health. These are both areas that we know create near-term pressure, but we believe they will drive compelling financial returns over time as they scale. I also want to note that since fiscal \u201820, our mix of revenue from our online channel has more than doubled, and we have efficiently evolved our operating model to support this shift in consumer shopping behavior, while at the same time, navigating higher wages and increase supply chain and technology costs. Let me now share more details on the first quarter performance versus last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 8.7% to $9.9 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 8.5%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, as expected, the largest comparable sales decline was the 5-week fiscal March period. As Corie noted, from a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing and home theater. In addition, services comparable sales declined 12% this quarter. This was primarily the result of our Totaltech membership, which includes benefits that were previously stand-alone revenue-generating services such as warranty and installation. In our International segment, revenue decreased 5.4% to $753 million. This decrease was driven by the loss of $19 million in revenue from exiting Mexico and a comparable sales decline of 1.4% in Canada. Turning now to gross profit. where our enterprise rate declined 120 basis points, 22.1%. The domestic gross profit rate declined 140 basis points, which was primarily driven by lower services margin rates, including pressure associated with Totaltech. In addition, lower product margin rates, which included increased promotional activity and the impact of higher supply chain costs also negatively impacted our rate during the quarter. The previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue in the company\u2019s private label and co-branded credit card arrangement. Lastly, our International non-GAAP gross profit rate improved 130 basis points compared to last year, which provided a weighted benefit of approximately 20 basis points to our Enterprise results. As a reminder, the gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. On a weighted basis, the services category negatively impacted the Domestic gross profit rate by approximately 100 basis points compared to last year, which largely aligned with our expectations entering the quarter. Moving next to SG&A. Our Enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $100 million while increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the Domestic segment, the primary driver of the reduced SG&A was lower incentive compensation of $130 million, which included lapping $40 million for one-time gratitude and appreciation awards last year. Partially offsetting the lower incentive compensation were increased expenses for advertising and our health initiatives. During the quarter, we returned a total of $654 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $455 million and dividends of $199 million. Our quarterly dividend of $0.88 was an increase of 26% and marked the 8th straight year our regular dividend increased at least 10% compared to the prior year. Consistent with our original guidance, we expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion in share repurchases this year. Let me next share more color on our guidance for the full year. Many of the key assumptions driving our outlook from when we enter the year remain unchanged. We still expect the first half of the year to be more pressured on a year-over-year basis for both revenue growth and our non-GAAP operating income rate. In addition, we still expect the non-GAAP operating income rate decline to be primarily come from lower gross profit rate, with Totaltech being the key driver. Let me next share some context on what has changed in our outlook. Entering the year, we were cognizant of lapping the large levels of government stimulus actions last year. As we already shared, sales came in a little lower than our expectations for the first quarter, and this trend has continued into the second quarter. It is difficult to assess how much of the decline may be longer tail associated with elevated stimulus spending last year or overall consumer spending slowing down due to inflationary concerns and the shift of consumer spending to experiences. Based on the trends we are seeing over the past several weeks, we now feel it\u2019s more likely that we will be on the lower end of our original guidance expectations. As a result, we now expect comparable sales to decline 3% to 6%. As Corie discussed, clearly, there is still a lot of uncertainty in macro cross currents. Thus, we will continue to assess the sales trends, adjusting for our spend for variable items like advertising and store labor, as well as discretionary areas as appropriate. We also expect favorable trends in our private label credit card arrangement to partially offset higher costs in areas like supply chain for the remainder of the year. At the same time, we remain committed to progressing the initiatives we are confident will deliver compelling financial returns in the future. As a result of the lower sales outlook, our non-GAAP operating income rate outlook is now 5.2% to 5.4%. Based on these factors, I\u2019ve just outlined, our guidance for the full year now represents the following : Enterprise revenue of $48.3 billion to $49.9 billion, a comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 5.2% to 5.4%, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $8.40 to $9. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 24%. And lastly, we still expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.1 billion. As we shared on our last earnings call, we no longer plan to provide quarterly guidance going forward. However, we\u2019d like to provide context on our expectations. Several of the key themes from the first quarter are expected to be consistent in the second quarter. As a result, we anticipate that our second quarter comparable sales and the year-over-year decline in our non-GAAP operating income rate will both be very similar to our first quarter results. Also, as a reminder, last year\u2019s second quarter included a one-time diluted earnings per share benefit of $0.47 from a lower effective tax rate. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We take our first question today from Zachary Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks so much. It\u2019s actually [indiscernible] pitching for Zach here. I wanted to ask kind of a big picture question. Maybe could you sort of recast your FY \u201825 assumptions in the context of today\u2019s updated guidance? Obviously, some of these macro headwinds you called out are maybe likely to be temporal. That said, does it put more pressure on your business to deliver in FY \u201824 and FY \u201825? And how should we be thinking about those 2% to 4% out year comps in that 6.3% to 6.8% operating margin target in that context? Matt Bilunas : Yes. Thank you for the question. Obviously, I think it\u2019s way too early for us to be updating our FY \u201825 goals at this point. You\u2019re right. I mean I think the lowering of the range this year does create a bit of a different picture. But at the same time, we very much believe in the strength of our industry and are very encouraged by the initiatives that we have, that we outlined at the Investor Day, Totaltech, and expanded assortment in our health initiatives. Those all remain the same. And if anything, we\u2019re even more excited about those as we look forward. So obviously, the ranges we gave this year, they are pretty wide. And the ranges for FY \u201825 is still pretty wide. So there is a number of outcomes we already had contemplated in setting those goals back in March. So we still remain pretty confident in those numbers. Unidentified Analyst : Awesome. No, that\u2019s super helpful. And then maybe pivoting a little bit here to appliances, obviously, it\u2019s great to see you guys still delivering positive comps here, especially given what you were up against last year. Kind of maybe you want to talk to the sustainability of the positive comps in the appliance segment, especially as we really kind of continue to lap some of that stimulus and maybe face some of these macro pressures. Thanks so much. Matt Bilunas : Yes. I think this appliances has been a place where we\u2019ve been sustaining growth for a long time, what\u2019s been growing every quarter for 10 years, except for one when we closed our stores. So we are very confident in our team\u2019s ability to continue to drive sales up. Clearly, there are some very elevated levels of comp that were coming over the last couple of years of spend. But the team continues to drive the assortment and the experience changes that make it a very meaningful place to buy appliances. And that includes both the majors and the small side. So we remain really excited and confident about the prospects there. For the 5th straight year, we see the J.D. Power award for the highest customer satisfaction among appliance retailers. So the team is getting the right experience that I think will help us drive sales higher as we look into the future. Unidentified Analyst : Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. Really appreciate it. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We take our next question from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes : Thank you and good morning. Corie, I wanted to focus on Totaltech, and I appreciate the color, but I was hoping if you can provide us a little more details around how membership is framing relative to expectations, maybe in the context of churn and/or retention? And then just a broader comment on what part of the value proposition do you think is resonating most with your customer in the current sort of environment? Corie Barry : Yes. So I\u2019m just going to start by taking a little bit of a step back here. Obviously, what we\u2019re aiming to do here is take our deep knowledge of the customer, combined with our history of a multitude of membership programs and our unique abilities to create a very unique paid membership offer with very broad reach. That broad appeal means we see more different types of demographics that this appeals to. And by the way, it is also more comfortable to sell because our associates just have a lot of passion around the multitude of offers. To specifically your question about what\u2019s resonating, the truth is all aspects are resonating, but different pieces seem to resonate with different demographics. Certainly, the included warranty aspects, especially the Apple Care resonates with some of our younger demographics. The pricing and discounts actually resonates across all and then the support we see resonate with some of our older demographics. So the point here is actually this broad reach of a multitude of pieces of the offer that will actually appeal to many. The purpose, as we said, is to drive frequency and share of wallet over time. The reason we\u2019re not updating right now is we are just starting to lap our beta test from last year. If you remember, we actually launched in April with the full rollout in October. And so we are literally just getting a feel now for what retention looks like. It remains in line with \u2013 as we\u2019ve converted customers remains in line with what we had expected. But right now, we\u2019re just \u2013 we want to actually start to lap some of those new customers who actually opted into the program before we comment too much on retention. What I will say is, look, the goal here is to create a moat around the consumer and to make it kind of inconceivable for them to buy CE anywhere else. And we know we\u2019re growing our share of wallet with those that are shopping us. So we know it\u2019s doing what we want it to do, but we\u2019re using this time period to continue to learn and iterate on the acquisition, the usage that we\u2019re seeing right now and then ultimately those retention figures. Steven Forbes : Thank you. I\u2019ll keep it to one. Best of luck. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Joe Feldman of Telsey has our next question. Please go ahead. Joe Feldman : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Back on the promotions, you mentioned some products are starting to get more promotional. And I guess I was just wondering which areas you are seeing more of that pressure and your view of promotions? Maybe the balance of this year, will it accelerate or do you think it will just be kind of normalized relative to a year ago? Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Sure. Thanks Joe. As we outlined back in March, we expected to see promotions be pressured this year compared to last year. And we also commented that we \u2013 that eventually, they would return to closer to FY \u201820 levels at some point. As we have got into the quarter, we actually started to seeing a little bit more pressure on the promotion side than we expected. Again, that was offset by a little bit of credit \u2013 better credit card profit share from the arrangement we have. But we did see a little bit more promotionality. And I think it\u2019s pretty broad across most of our categories. We are starting to increase in terms of the amount of discount and the mix on promotion. TVs was a place where we did see more promotions on a year-over-year basis. Computing has been starting more promotional all the way back to July of last year. So, that continued as well. So, those are the areas I would probably highlight, but there are also even just some very iconic type of products to in specific categories that are very promotional, even though in some cases inventory is constrained. And so overall, we know it\u2019s returning as we expected it would. It isn\u2019t quite back to FY \u201820 levels, but it is heading in the same \u2013 heading to that path as we expected. Joe Feldman : That\u2019s great. Thank you. And I will also keep it to one and good luck this quarter. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Corie Barry : Thanks Joe. Operator : We will move now to Mike Baker of Davidson. Please go ahead. Mike Baker : Hi. Thanks guys. A couple of related questions. One, you said March was the worst part of the quarter. So, can you talk a little bit about April? It sounds like you said the weakness is continuing, but a little bit more detail there. And then related to that, it looks like \u2013 and this is similar to your previous guidance, but the back half is much better in terms of year-over-year changes versus the implied front half. What gives you that confidence? Is it simply just different comparisons, or why are we expecting a significantly better back half? Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Sure, yes. So, we are not going to comment on specific months, but March was the biggest decline in Q1. And as the sales pressure continued as we exited Q1 \u2013 actually, it was a little more pressure than on sales than we expected. If you remember last year, too, as we got into the second quarter, we talked about how we were still doing about a 30% comp in the first few weeks of May. So, we are still lapping those stimulus payments that kind of came in starting in March of last year. And so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the lion\u2019s share of that sales decline. As you think about the back half of the year, I mean there is a number of things. We believe as you get to the back half, most of that stimulus impact, a lot of it will have left in terms of a comparison. We also know, as we look to the back half of the year, we do expect product availability and certain products and categories to improve compared to the first part of this year and also if you look at compared to last year, in Q4, there was some notable product shortages in iconic areas that we talked about not getting, that did have an impact on sales. We also, in Q4, shortened our store hours in January as we were lapping some of the Omicron variant impacts. And then lastly, I comment is we do expect our initiatives to start to continue to drive more impact to our sales outlook as you get further down into the trajectory of those ramps. So, those are the reasons I would highlight. Mike Baker : Okay. Thank you for the color. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : Next, we will move to Karen Short of Barclays. Please go ahead. Karen Short : Hi. Thanks very much. I actually just wanted to push a little harder and follow-up on the 2025 guide with respect to where you are at today? And obviously, as you were just asked, you did elaborate a little bit on what the second half and why the second half will look better. But maybe a little more color on why you feel confident in the 2025 guide, about 6.3 to 6.8 in light of the fact that, obviously, 2Q will be much weaker than expected. And then just on that same note, are you factoring in a recessionary environment with respect to your guidance for the year and with respect to your 2025 guide? Corie Barry : Yes. So, I will start with the fiscal \u201825 guidance. I am going to reiterate what Matt said. It is still really early in the long-range guide that we gave. And there are many moving parts and pieces as I outlined in some of the prepared comments. And so we remain confident in the initiatives and the roadmap that we have put together to deliver that \u201825 guide. And as Matt said, it\u2019s a pretty wide range. So, what we are going to use this year to do is to continue to understand how those initiatives develop, how this year plays out, obviously, and then how the implications for all of that in that longer term guide. But I think it warrants giving it some time to see how the year is going to play. Specific to your point about recession, I want to take one step back here for a second. I think I want to start with a reminder that this is a very stable industry. Consumer electronics, over time, is a stable industry. And the last 2 years have clearly underscored the importance of tech in people\u2019s lives. So, I think it\u2019s important for us to have that as a backdrop and the fact that we were obviously already planning for our industry to decline this year, and then we have adjusted based on what we are seeing in the recent results. It\u2019s fair to say that we are factoring in elements of softer demand, but we are not planning for a full recession or guide. We will not assume a full recession at this point. Obviously, if that were the case, we will continue to update the performance and the expectations. But I think I would characterize our guide more as a softer environment, not a full recession. Matt Bilunas : And I might just add, I think also, I think you made a question around the rate guide as well. I think as you think about the rate this year, we are actually not too far off from our original guidance expectations for this year from 5.2 to 5.4, just acknowledging a little bit of softer on the sales side. But all of the structural things that are included in that expectation are kind of coming in as we expect. It\u2019s nothing that\u2019s too dissimilar at this point. And we have already built those into what we see this year and what we see in the out years to be confident in addition to sales, but also being able to achieve some of those rate expectations for FY \u201825. Karen Short : Okay. Thank you very much. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities has our next question. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. I would like to follow-up on the promotional environment. If you could give us some sense as to what you are planning for in terms of promotions this year relative to pre-pandemic levels? And how much is embedded in terms of gross margin pressure relative to your prior guide, that would be helpful. Matt Bilunas : Yes. So, I would say it\u2019s fair to say we expect, like I said earlier, that promotions returned closer and closer to FY \u201820. Throughout this year, exactly when that happens, we are not commenting on, but we would expect it to increase as the year progresses. Importantly, as you look to the back half of this year, though we are starting to lap where promotions increased last year, starting in July in computing. So, we have baked into our plans a slow increase of promotionality in most categories as you get towards the back half of this year. Exactly where that lands exactly at FY \u201820, we are \u2013 it\u2019s hard to exactly say, but we have baked that into the plans. Corie Barry : And I think it\u2019s worth noting, and I know all of you know this, but just to reiterate. Obviously, promotions are not just a function of Best Buy. They are a function of relationships with our vendors as well. We are interested in ensuring that their newest and greatest products are out there for the world to see and priced appropriately. So, this is not just a function of Best Buy promotionality. It\u2019s a function of the overall industry promotionality in partnership with our vendors. Seth Basham : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now move to Jonathan Matuszewski of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Jonathan Matuszewski : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Matt, a lot of our clients are focused on the ability of companies to flex expenses in an environment of slowing demand potentially persisting. Could you just update us on the fixed and variable split in your P&L and priorities for reduced discretionary spend if the backdrop does worsen? Thanks so much. Matt Bilunas : Sure. Yes. So, as we started the year, we \u2013 even the guide that we gave at 5.4% on a range of sales outcomes, we \u2013 there is a level of implied already trying to understand the levers you do to keep within the 5.4% rate in terms of the original guidance. So, it\u2019s something that we do as a normal course of business as we see sales slide up or slide down from our expectations. There are a number of areas where you can \u2013 that simply happen because they are variable to like check lane tender, but you also start to adjust areas like marketing or store labor associated with the lower volumes if it does happen. So, those are the variable things that we look at to adjust to as the sales trends change. In addition to that, there are even some more discretionary areas that you can start to look at in addition to variable items. But in some cases \u2013 or even additional marketing to the extent that you are comfortable or even simple areas like travel or adjusting your capital spend, which can adjust depreciation depending on when you do that during a year. So, there are variable and then more discretionary. And as Corie noted, we are not really planning for a recession this year. To the extent that we did, there is obviously more fixed cost areas you can look at if business trends down even more. Right now, we are not planning for that. You can imagine if that had happened, we would look at some of those areas as well. But we would \u2013 in any event, we are trying to hold dear to us strategic investments that we are making, that provide that long-term growth to get to our FY \u201825 goal. So, that\u2019s the last place that we will look at reducing as we look to this year in terms of how we see it now. Corie Barry : I do think it\u2019s fair to say the team has obviously navigated this softening environment quite well up to this point. And obviously, the factors that we use, as we are trying to adjust to that softer demand, obviously overlap with the considerations that you would take into account if you are managing for a recession. So, you can imagine behind the scenes, you are running through a bunch of scenarios. And I think the team has done a nice job flexing with a rapidly changing environment and it\u2019s that same type of kind of mindset and considerations you would take if that were to flex down even further. Jonathan Matuszewski : It makes sense. Thanks guys. Best of luck. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we will move to Brad Thomas of KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Brad Thomas : Hi. Good morning. Just want to ask about inventory a bit. Corie, I think you characterize inventory as being overall healthy. But just wondering if you could put that into a little more context, talk about some of the levers you may be able to pull if the consumer continues to weaken here? And then maybe if you could just help us think a little bit more about how much inventory levels were up just because of inflation and ASPs? Thanks so much. Corie Barry : Yes. First, just some gratitude to the team who has really done amazing work, carefully managing our inventory levels and then importantly, leveraging some of the investments that we have made in our supply chain. Some context is helpful here. Our inventory balance was unusually low last year. So again, if you remember how much demand there was in the marketplace at 37% comp, we had an unusually low balance last year. And that inventory balance right now is almost perfectly in line with the sales growth versus pre-pandemic. So, if you went back to kind of normalized pre-pandemic, now, sales growth and inventory growth are almost perfectly in line. And I think that\u2019s a true testament to our vendor partnerships and proactively managing those levels in line with what we have been seeing. Behind the theme, as you can imagine, actually, units in some of the key categories are down as we have seen ASP shifting from the variety of factors that I noted, whether it\u2019s premium and the mix shift in our business or inflation. So, that\u2019s even what underscores the confidence that I have in the statement around our inventory being healthy, feeling very much like it\u2019s in the right place. I think it is important to note, there is still some spotty constraints in very isolated areas for specific vendors and some of the more iconic SKUs that Matt mentioned. But over-archingly, we feel very strongly that we are in a good inventory position, and that\u2019s very much in line with how we have managed inventory historically. Brad Thomas : That\u2019s great, Corie. And any context on how much inflation has your inventory up and \u2013 thank you so much. Corie Barry : Yes. We haven\u2019t sized it specifically as I kind of alluded to the fact. It\u2019s really hard because back to when about the different pieces that are driving our ASPs up, du have got mix shifts in the business. As people have skewed more premium, you have got more appliances, which tends to skew to higher ASPs. You have got over-archingly, over the last couple of years, fewer markdowns, less promotions, and then you also have inflation. So, all of those pieces add into the ASP increases we have been seeing. That\u2019s why the color I am trying to give is we have actually seen in many of the key categories at the unit levels of our inventory are actually down versus some of the pre-pandemic comparisons and a lot of that is being driven by this kind of confluence of ASP increase. Brad Thomas : Got it. Very helpful. Thanks Corie. Corie Barry : Yes. Thanks. Operator : Scot Ciccarelli from Truist Security has our next question. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning guys. Scott Ciccarelli. So, Corie, we have heard that several other retailers that had a pretty tough March and April have indicated that sales have started to improve in May. But your comments on 2Q would suggest you really haven\u2019t seen that. So, I guess my question is, why do you think your business hasn\u2019t necessarily seen the kind of recovery we have seen in some other retail verticals? And related to that, would your cadence comments be any different if we are looking at stock trends? Thanks. Corie Barry : I will start and then Matt can clean up anything that I miss. But you have to also look back to last year, and Matt alluded to this. We have that really high sustained growth into May, like we posted the 37% comp in Q1, and then that sustained 30s into May. So, we were we \u2013 unlike some others, we are lapping very sustained high growth, both stimulus related, stay at home related from last year, which is a different cadence. I also think you have heard other retailers comment on the weather and some of the \u2013 and that\u2019s not going to impact our business nearly as much as others. So, I think from a \u2013 like when we \u2013 you almost have to go back to kind of a 3-year look at the business, it\u2019s relatively consistent and actually pretty strong as we are heading into Q2 on that 3-year stack. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thank you. Corie Barry : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Moving now to Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital. Please go ahead. Scott Mushkin : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I want to get back to profitability a little bit. And the question is basically if, and I know it\u2019s a big if, sales or revenues would fall back to where they were pre-pandemic. Do you guys believe the business even with that is structurally more profitable? And if so, why would you believe that? Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Yes, I think we believe that it is structurally more profitable than it was pre-pandemic. As you think about some of the actions and work we have done over the last 2 years to adjust our model with the very heavy shift to digital sales almost doubling from pre-pandemic. We have taken appropriate action to understand the cost structures whether they are to support digital or in our stores or just to support a different type of customer fulfillment need. We have taken the right actions over that period of time to adjust our model \u2013 our cost model to understand \u2013 to account for the changing sales and margin structure \u2013 our gross margin structure. So, we fundamentally do believe that that\u2019s in how we actually decide to fulfill product to customers. That\u2019s on how many associates we have in our stores. It\u2019s a number of things that we have thoughtfully looked at over the last couple of years to change the structure of cost between gross margin rate and SG&A. So, we do believe that fundamentally, in Q1, we were up 80 basis points compared to Q1 pre-pandemic, and that is to account for even though we do have investments like Totaltech at 100 basis points in Q1 and have a doubling of the e-com business, which is a higher parcel cost, we are still getting SG&A leverage considerably better over in Q1 to offset some of those gross margin investments that we are actually making in our business. So, we fundamentally do believe that the structure of our business is finally more profitable. And that\u2019s also underlying in our commitment, our goal is to get to the FY \u201820 goals of 6.3% to 6.8%. Scott Mushkin : Thanks. That was great, Matt. I appreciate it. Operator : We will move next to Peter Keith of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Peter Keith : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. One area I was hoping you could address was the Best Buy ads initiative. My understanding was that should be accretive to gross margin. And obviously, there seems to be some change or evolution of the ad spending backdrop. So, maybe address any changes to the outlook of that program. And separately, just sticking on gross margin, Matt, should that 100 basis points of Totaltech pressure that you saw in Q1, should that continue with Q2? Matt Bilunas : Sure. I will start with the Totaltech pressure. As you look towards the back half of the year, we started to lap the launch of Totaltech. So, we expect the Q2 drivers to be similar to Q1. That would include Totaltech pressure of around 100 basis points. But as you look to Q3 and Q4, we begin to lap it. We launched Totaltech in October of last year, so we don\u2019t lap until the end of this Q3. So, there is still a little pressure from Totaltech in Q3. Then by Q4, the pressure on a year-over-year basis essentially goes down to zero, if you will, because we have lapped the launch of it. So, that\u2019s how the cadence of Totaltech pressure goes. Corie Barry : And just a quick reminder on the ads business. Obviously, this is us selling advertising to brands that want to reach our customers, both on our own channels and then on some external sites. I think what\u2019s important here is that our leadership in CE retail remains very, very valuable, high customer traffic and engagement. And it\u2019s that first-party data that we have, which can allow our advertisers to reach really unique audiences. Because we see people all along their purchase journey, which means you can target them at various points in the purchase journey. We haven\u2019t shared specific financial details, but we did see growth in the ads business in Q1, not material enough to highlight for the quarter, but even entering the year. We knew this would be a favorable contributor to the gross profit rate, but a little bit more weighted towards the second half of the year as this ramp continues. And then obviously, this is something that provides that ongoing growth and incremental profitability over time that gives us confidence in those longer term targets. Peter Keith : Okay. Thank you very much. Corie Barry : Thank you, Peter. And with that, I want to thank you all for joining us today. I hope that many of our investors who are listening today will be able to join us at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which will be held virtually on June 9th. Thanks everyone and have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 11 :00 a.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]  I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien : Thank you, and good morning, everyone.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.  I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am incredibly proud of our teams as they continue to rise to the challenges over the past few years. With so much going on that is beyond their control, I remain impressed at their ability to manage the rapidly shifting business environment and priorities. As we said in March, we expected our financial results would be softer this year as we lapped record sales volumes. However, the macro environment has been more challenged and uneven than expected due to several factors. And that has put more pressure on our industry, changing the trajectory of our business versus our original plan. We are focused on balancing our near-term response to difficult conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also delivering on our strategic initiatives and what will be important for our long-term growth. Our strategy and our confidence in it remains unchanged. We have exciting opportunities ahead of us in a world that is more reliant on technology than ever. We are a financially strong company with a resilient world-class team that will successfully navigate the current environment.  Now on to the second quarter results we reported this morning. Our comparable sales were down 12.1% as we lapped strong Q2 comparable sales last year of almost 20%. This represents 8.3% sales growth over the second quarter of pre-pandemic fiscal '20. Our non-GAAP operating income rate declined compared to last year on the SG&A deleverage from the lower revenue, the investments in our growth initiatives and the increased promotional environment for consumer electronics. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was up 43% versus pre-pandemic fiscal '20.  We are clearly operating in a volatile consumer electronics industry. We assume the CE industry would be lower following 2 years of elevated growth, driven by unusually strong demand for technology products and services and fueled partly by stimulus dollars. In addition, we expected to see some impact to our business as customers broadly shifted their wallet spend back into experience areas, such as travel and entertainment. We did not expect and compounding these impacts as a changing macro environment where consumers are dealing with sustained and record high levels of inflation in some of the most fundamental parts of their daily lives, like food.  While these factors have led to an uneven sales environment, they have not deterred us from continuing to make progress on our initiatives. During the quarter, we drove broad customer NPS improvements even compared to pre-pandemic levels, particularly in installation and repair. We signed up new Best Buy Totaltech members and increased our delivery speed, delivering almost 1/3 of customer online orders in one day. We also completed store remodels, opened new outlet stores and began implementing newly signed deals with health care companies.  From a top line perspective, we saw year-over-year sales declines across most product categories, with the largest impacts to comparable sales coming from computing and home theater. Although down from last year's strong sales compared to Q2 of fiscal '20, our computing revenue has grown more than 20%. Our Domestic appliance business comparable sales declined slightly as it laps more than 30% growth in the second quarter of last year, and revenue is up more than 45% compared to fiscal '20. Our data would tell us that customers are making some decisions to trade down, particularly those in lower income households. This is not across all categories. But for example, in the television category, customers are moving more into our lower price point exclusive brands products. We're also seeing more interest in sales events, such as Prime Day, tax-free events and other events geared at exceptional value. I applaud our team's proactive management of our inventory during the quarter as we saw the sales trajectory changing. Our inventory at the end of Q2 was down 6% from the second quarter of last year and up approximately 16% from pre-pandemic fiscal '20. Overall, our inventory is healthy and reflects an evolving mix of product in our network, including more high ASP appliances and larger-screen televisions, which also have longer lead times and a slower inventory turn. While we took more inventory markdowns than last year, the level reflected a normalization to pre-pandemic activity.  Within our inventory numbers, there are categories where we have ample inventory supply and still pockets where we are constrained. In our industry, it's not as simple as we have inventory or we don't. It can be incredibly variable by product and even brands within a particular product. For example, we are also still experiencing inventory constraints in key models and brands across computing and gaming.  As we move into the back half of the year, we are planning inventory thoughtfully, yet investing strategically for holiday. While it is important to manage inventory against current demand, we also want to ensure we are well positioned to react to the ever-changing consumer needs. The promotional environment was more intense than last year and even more than we expected entering the quarter as sales demand softened. Some areas were quite aggressive from a promotional standpoint, especially where inventory was ample or in excess. Overall, we feel the level of promotionality has returned to pre-pandemic levels.  Over the past few years, we have seen gross profit pressure from higher supply chain costs, which, of course, includes increased parcel costs from our higher mix of online sale. In addition, we estimate that roughly half of the increased supply chain cost this quarter versus the comparable period in fiscal '20 is being driven by cost increases or inflationary pressures. Conditions across the global supply chain continue to evolve. On a year-over-year basis, we saw higher costs in Q2 and expect that to continue through the remainder of the year. However, we are starting to see some signs that the market is stabilizing and moderating.  During the pandemic, the capacity and rate pressure started in International and works their way to Domestic logistics. Now we are experiencing some relief in International first and early signs of loosening markets domestically. For example, in Ocean Logistics, we are taking advantage of some rate opportunities, but continue to be mindful of ILWU labor discussions and overall U.S. port congestion as we move into the peak shipping season. As it relates to inbound Domestic transportation, while we are starting to see a more balanced capacity market, we continue to see inflationary pressures from higher fuel and labor costs and rail yard and general supply chain network congestion.  I would like to provide an update on Totaltech, our unique membership program designed to provide customers with complete confidence in their technology, with benefits that include member pricing discounts, product protection, free delivery, and standard installation and 24/7 tech support. Considering the macro environment and decline in our product sales, we are encouraged with the pace at which we are acquiring new members. In Q2, nearly half of the new members joining the program were either new or lapsed customers, reinforcing how the value of this program resonates beyond our existing loyal customers. Our associates continue to embrace the program as the fulsome nature of the offering not only simplifies the sales interaction, it also is a program our team members can confidently stand behind as they believe in the value it provides to every single customer. In July, we enhanced our in-store point-of-sale tools to better assist our team in showcasing the value of Totaltech to potential new members, and their early results have been positive. At this point in the national launch, we continue to be encouraged by the higher engagement, customer satisfaction and increased revenue we're seeing from customers who have signed up to become members.  As we have previously shared, from a financial perspective, Totaltech is a near-term investment to drive longer-term benefits. Over time, we expect the incremental spend we garner from members will lead to higher operating income dollars. As I've just covered, there are several things we are seeing with the program that give us confidence that customers value the membership and that our thesis in general is playing out. At the same time, consumer electronics is a low-frequency category. And we are in a unique macro environment, meaning it will take time for us to truly assess the performance. As you would expect, we will continue to monitor the program and iterate on the offering as we learn more.  In addition to Totaltech, our Best Buy branded credit card continues to drive a valuable and sticky relationship with our customers. We continue to see growth in cardholders. More than 25% of our revenue is transacted on our Best Buy branded card. And cardholders have been increasing the use of their card outside Best Buy stores as well. These customers tend to be more engaged with Best Buy over time, with higher frequency and spend than non-cardholders. Combined with our partners' largest lease-to-own portfolio and our buy now, pay later test, this means we can offer our customers a variety of ways they can shop confidently with us. And we can leverage those relationships into our future.  As we emerge from the pandemic, it is clear that our customer shopping behavior has changed. Our online sales as a percentage of Domestic revenue in Q2 was 31%, nearly twice as high as pre-pandemic. Virtual revenue via video, phone and chat is growing rapidly as well, as sales for the first 6 months of the year are already almost equal to the virtual revenue we generated for all of last year. While still small overall, sales in our virtual store are ramping quickly. And we recently expanded categories to include appliances and home theater. In addition, our high NPS in-home interactions continue to increase rapidly. In fact, in-home installations have seen double-digit growth versus the prior year in 5 of the last 6 quarters and year-to-date in-home sales consultations are up more than 30% over last year and pre-pandemic.  Of course, our stores remain incredibly important for customers to see and touch products and get advice. In addition, they're crucial to our fulfillment strategy. In the second quarter, customers representing 42% of our online sales chose to pick up their products at our stores and an additional 18% of online sales were shipped out of our store to customer homes. These in-store pickup and ship from store numbers have remained incredibly consistent for the last several years, even as shipping speed and options have dramatically increased. It is imperative that we evaluate how we operate and service of these evolving customer needs and make the necessary adjustments to ensure we come out of this not just a vital company, but a vibrant one.  We tested new field operating models in 4 markets over the past year to help us better understand how to deploy leadership resources in a more digital world. As a result of these tests, earlier this month, we made structural changes to our operating model that resulted in some store roles being eliminated. We hope to retain as many of these talented associates as possible. This is one component of our enterprise-wide restructuring initiative that commenced this quarter. With these changes, we are able to reinvest back into frontline customer-facing sales associates.  We are continuing to reimagine our physical presence in ways that cater to our customers' changing shopping patterns as well. As part of our Charlotte holistic market approach pilot, we are testing a new 5,000 square foot store with a unique digital-first approach. Just opened last month, the store includes a 7-foot tall digital display that customers will see as they enter the store that explains what's new and how customers can shop. The store includes curated assortments across our product categories, except for major appliances and other large products. The majority of products will primarily be on display to touch and try.  To purchase, customers can scan the QR code on any product price tag using their phone. This immediately sends a notification to a Best Buy employee to pick up the product from the store's backroom and bring it to the register for checkout. Of course, customers who want to will be able to consult with sales associates, in-home consultants and Geek Squad agents, who always have access to our complete assortment online using our increasingly rapid shipping. From an online sales fulfillment perspective, the store offers both in-store pickup and convenient lockers.  The Charlotte market pilot also includes a traditional core store that we converted to an outlet store. The outlet has an expanded assortment of product categories, a dedicated team of employees and agents that rapidly quality check and repair all product for resale, a new services repair hub and spoke model, and an Autotech mega hub for car tech installation. This outlet is performing extremely well and is frankly on track to deliver revenue on par to the pre-converted conventional store, with a considerably lower operating cost and greater productivity. Those results give us confidence in our outlet strategy.  During the quarter, we opened 2 new outlet stores in Virginia and Phoenix and just opened a location in Chicago earlier this month, bringing us to 19 locations. We see twice the recovery rate of our COGS when we sell open box, clearance and end-of-life inventory at our outlets versus alternative channels. With assortment expanded to include major appliances, large TVs, computing, gaming and mobile phones, we believe now is an opportune time to appeal to our existing Best Buy customers as well as an increasingly deal-seeking consumer overall.  Our outlet store assortment is also available for purchase online, with many products eligible for national ship-to-home fulfillment as well as local store pickup. This capability unlocks a very productive way to refurbish inventory, giving it a new life, while also serving a deal-seeking customer. We still plan to double the number of outlets to approximately 30, although some may not open until fiscal '24. So far this year, we have invested in and completed 7 experienced store concept remodels. The results we are seeing in the existing 2 pilot remodels, including higher NPS and higher customer spend, continue to make us confident in and excited about this part of our strategy. We expect to complete a total of approximately 40 experienced store remodels this year. I am very proud of how much work the team has done to test and iterate multiple store and operating model concepts over the past few years in response to the dramatic pivot in customer behavior. We introduced a great deal of change into the field, not always perfectly. And we have learned and accelerated some initiatives while stopping others. On top of that, of course, the macro backdrop has shifted and the trajectory of the business has changed significantly in an incredibly short time.  We continue to invest in our people and our stores, with an eye toward the best possible customer experience, leveraging our unique differentiators. Through all the changes, overarching store NPS is substantially higher than pre-pandemic, including more stores than we have ever seen at what we consider to be best-in-class level. This is entirely due to our amazing store associates' hard work and dedication to always being there for our customers. We have consistently invested in our employees over the past 3 years, including raising hourly wages more than 20% versus pre-pandemic and adding additional benefits, such as paid caregiver leave, financial hardship assistance and paid time off for part-time employees. Now I would like to touch on Best Buy Health. Our consumer health business, where we curate health and wellness products online and in our stores, is largely experiencing similar revenue trends as our core category. We are excited about the new FDA ruling that allows the sale of over-the-counter hearing aid. We just announced an expanded collection of hearing devices, an in-store experience in more than 300 stores and a new online hearing assessment tool, making it more convenient than ever for the millions of Americans with mild-to-moderate hearing loss to get the products and support they need.  During the second quarter, we continued to see strong growth in new sign-ups for our active aging business that offers health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home. Revenue for this business was slightly up in the quarter compared to last year.  We are encouraged by the momentum we have built in the virtual care business in the first half of the year. We are very focused on successfully implementing the large U.S. health system accounts that have been won recently, including NYU Langone Health for hospital at home and Mount Sinai Health Systems for chronic disease management. And we are also making progress leveraging our Best Buy capabilities in this space. Our Geek Squad team successfully completed additional health training in Q2 and launched a new Geek Squad pilot service with Geisinger Health. As a reminder, the revenue contribution from virtual care is currently very small and will take time to ramp as health industry has a longer return on investment. We just published our 17th annual ESG report, which outlines how we are working across the company to make a positive impact on our planet, employees, customers and communities. We continue to focus on ESG initiatives that drive sustainable long-term value creation. Last year, we made significant progress toward our goals to reduce our carbon footprint, attain our 2025 hiring commitments and expand our Best Buy Teen Tech Center program. We recently hit a milestone with the Best Buy Foundation Teen Tech Centers when we opened one earlier this month in Gary, Indiana, marking our 50th Teen Tech Center. These centers provide teens from disinvested communities with guidance, training and tech access to help successfully prepare them for the future. In terms of the environment, we continue to drive forward the circular economy, a system in which nothing is wasted. Since 2009, we have reduced our carbon emissions 62% through investments in renewable energy and operational improvements. We are on track to reduce our carbon emissions 75% by 2030. And last year, we became a founding member of the Breakthroughs 2030 Retail Campaign, which aims to accelerate climate action within our industry.  We continue to operate the most comprehensive consumer electronics and appliances take-back program in the U.S., collecting more than 2.5 billion pounds since 2009. We also made significant progress toward our fiscal '25 hiring commitment to help ensure we build an inclusive, diverse and thriving workforce. In fiscal '22, we filled 37% of new salaried corporate positions with black, indigenous and people of color employees, ahead of our goal to fill 1 in 3 position. And we filled 26% of new salaried field positions with women employees, marking progress on our goal to fill 1 of 3 positions. We're proud that 60% of our most senior leaders, including our Board of Directors and Executive team, is made up of women and people of color. We encourage you to review our full ESG report available on our corporate website. In summary, the first half of the year has been difficult from a sales perspective. And our employees have executed well in the evolving environment, in many cases, making hard decisions to run the business effectively and prioritize our customers.  I just want to take a moment to address the fiscal '25 financial goals we introduced in March. We remain confident in the strategic premise covered in March. However, the current macro backdrop has changed in ways that we and many others were not expecting. As such, we are removing these targets. And we'll share more context on our midterm financial expectations once we begin to experience a more stable operating environment.  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are managing thoughtfully and carefully, while still investing in our future. This includes actively assessing further actions to evolve our operating model, manage profitability and iterate on our growth initiatives. We fundamentally believe that technology is more important than ever in our everyday lives. And as a result of the past few years, consumers have even more technology devices in their homes that will need to be updated, upgraded and supported over time. As our vendor partners continue to innovate and the world becomes increasingly more digital in all aspects, we will be there to uniquely help customers in our stores, online, virtually and directly in their homes. This company has navigated monumental change, riding incredible highs and managing difficult lows since our founding 56 years ago. As we have done throughout our history, we will use this moment to lead and double down on our purpose, making it clear that we continue to uniquely support customers in ways literally no one else can.  Now I would like to turn the call over to Matt for additional details on our second quarter results and outlook for the remainder of the year. Matthew Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you were able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. I will walk through details on our Q2 results before providing insight into how we are thinking about the back half of the year.  Enterprise revenue of $10.3 billion declined 12% on a comparable basis as we lapped very strong 20% comparable sales growth last year. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.1% compared to 6.9% last year. As expected and similar to last quarter, our investment in Totaltech membership added approximately 100 basis points of operating income rate pressure this quarter compared to last year. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $129 million lower than last year, but were 120 basis points unfavorable as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.54 decreased $1.44 or 48%. A lower share count resulted in a $0.16 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. However, it was offset by a higher non-GAAP tax rate. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 13.1% to $9.6 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 12.7%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, fiscal June's comparable sales decline of 16% was the largest decline, whereas fiscal July was our best performing month during the quarter compared to both last year and to the pre-pandemic fiscal '20 comparable period. As Corie noted, from a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing and home theater.  In our International segment, revenue decreased 9.3% to $760 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 4.2% in Canada and the negative impact of 420 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. This marks the first quarter where Mexico was fully removed from the prior year comparison.  Turning now to gross profit. Our enterprise rate declined 160 basis points to 22.1%. The Domestic gross profit rate declined 170 basis points, which was primarily driven by the lower services margin rates, including pressure from Totaltech. In addition, lower product margin rates and the impact of higher supply chain costs also negatively impacted our rate during the quarter. These items were partially offset by higher profit-sharing revenue from the company's credit card arrangement.  As a reminder, the approximately 100 basis points of gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. Our product margin rates were lower than our expectations in Q2, driven by higher levels of promotionality. Generally, lower consumer demand has combined with the higher levels of inventory across the CE industry, which has resulted in more discounting across most of our categories. As Corie mentioned, overall, the level of promotionality has returned to pre-pandemic levels, which is slightly ahead of our expectations earlier in the year. Moving next to SG&A. As I mentioned earlier, our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $129 million, while increasing 120 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the Domestic segment, the primary driver of the reduced SG&A was lower incentive compensation of approximately $135 million.  Let me add some additional details on the incentive compensation expense, which year-to-date is approximately $265 million lower than last year through the second quarter. Based on our current outlook for this year, we are expecting to be below the required financial thresholds for short-term incentive performance metrics. This compares to last year when payouts were near the maximum levels. As a result, we anticipate additional incentive compensation favorability in the second half of the year. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 16.7% versus 8.4% last year. For the full year, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 23% versus our previous guidance of approximately 24%. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $840 million in cash. As Corie mentioned, at the end of Q2, our inventory balance was approximately 6% lower than last year's comparable period. And we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $862 million to shareholders through share repurchases of $465 million and dividends of $397 million. We paused share repurchases during the second quarter, spending only $10 million. Looking forward, we will continue to assess the appropriate timing for resuming share repurchases.  We are committed to being a premium dividend payer. Based on our current planning assumptions for fiscal '23, our quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share will fall outside of our stated payout ratio target of 35% to 45% of our non-GAAP net income. We viewed this target as a long-term in nature and do not plan to reduce the dividend should it fall outside of the range in any one year.  From a capital expenditure standpoint, we now expect to spend approximately $1 billion during the year. This is slightly lower than our previous outlook of approximately $1.1 billion. However, it exceeds the level of investment we have been making over the past few years. The largest driver of the increased spend this year compared to prior trends is store-related investments. This includes both our 40 experiential store remodels, as Corie mentioned, as well as general improvements in a number of our other locations after delaying the work the past couple of years during the pandemic.  Let me next share more color on our guidance for the full year, starting with our revenue assumptions. As I mentioned at the start of my comments, we are assuming comparable sales for the year to decline in the range of around 11%, which represents a comparable sales decline for the remainder of the year and is similar to what we just reported for Q2. In addition, this reflects an assumption that our revenue growth versus fiscal '20 will continue to slow and that revenue in the second half of the year will be very similar to comparable pre-pandemic fiscal '20 time period. This is due to a belief that the current macro environment trends could be even more challenging and have a larger impact for the remainder of the year.  This aligns with the trends we are seeing so far this quarter as August revenue declined approximately 10% versus last year. When comparing to fiscal '20, August revenue increased in the low single-digit range, which is a sequential decline from the second quarter trends. Our outlook for a non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 4% for the year is anchored to our negative 11% comparable sales assumption. This represents a decrease of 200 basis points to last year, with roughly half of the decline from lower gross profit rate and half from higher SG&A rate.  As you may recall, our original guidance entering the year included a non-GAAP operating income rate decline of approximately 60 basis points, which was expected to come almost entirely from the gross profit rate, with Totaltech being the primary driver. The pressure we are expecting from Totaltech continues to align with our original expectations, while the additional gross profit rate pressure in our revised outlook is largely due to higher promotional activity in the consumer electronics industry.  From an SG&A standpoint, we have continued to lower our forecasted SG&A spend as the year has progressed, but not at the same pace as our lowered sales expectations. As I shared earlier, our outlook for the year assumes incentive compensation to be significantly below prior year levels. Compared to last year in our original outlook, we are planning for lower store payroll expenses and other variable expenses. We've also reduced spend in discretionary areas by increasing the rigor around backfilling corporate roles, capital expenditures and travel. Partially offsetting these items are increased investments compared to last year in Best Buy Health, technology and our store remodel work.  Next, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of the ongoing changes in business trends, during Q2, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending to critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $34 million of such restructuring costs in the second quarter, primarily related to termination benefits. We currently expect to incur additional charges to the remainder of fiscal 2023 for this initiative. Consistent with prior practice, restructuring costs are excluded from our non-GAAP results.  Lastly, let me share a couple of comments specific to the third quarter. We anticipate that our third quarter comparable sales declined slightly more than the negative 12% we reported for the second quarter. We anticipate the year-over-year decline in our non-GAAP operating income rate will be similar to or slightly higher than our second quarter results. This includes a little less gross profit rate pressure as we lap the last year's national rollout of Totaltech during the quarter. However, we expect a little more SG&A rate deleverage in Q3 from the larger sales decline.  I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Greg Melich : I'd love to finish where you -- or start where you finished, which was the third quarter guidance on margin decline and what it implies for the fourth quarter. I want to make sure that, that OI decline that would be in basis points versus the second quarter down to 60. And does that imply that in the fourth quarter, EBIT margin should only be down maybe 50 bps and would be well above 4% in the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Matthew Bilunas : Yes. I think based on the implied comments for Q3, what we said is a similar OI rate decline as Q2, if not slightly higher, which is about 280 basis points on the math. It would imply that Q4 does improve from an EBIT rate perspective, the gross margin rate pressure in Q4 will abate a bit compared to the previous quarters as we've lapped the Totaltech. And we're beginning to lap some of the product margin rate pressures we experienced last year as promotionality started to return. But you're starting to see more SG&A to leverage in Q4 considering where sales are trending in comparison to the prior quarters. Greg Melich : Got it. And my follow-up was more on the top line on the consumer. I think, Corie, you mentioned seeing some trade down in some categories. Could you talk about which categories you're not seeing it in and where there seems to be a good sell-through and whatever you can get? Corie Barry : Yes. I mean there's -- there are categories where the price points and decisions around the type of product matter. Large TVs is the example we use. There are other categories like let's take mobile phones where it's not as much a decision between trading up or trading down. You want a certain brand. You want a certain type of phone. And so -- or even some of what we're seeing in gaming, where as much of the kind of gaming hardware as we can get our hands on, the consumer is looking to purchase. So that's why it isn't perfectly even throughout the categories in our business, in particular, because sometimes, you're very brand-specific. And then sometimes, you're more brand-agnostic and you're just looking for the right experience. Operator : We'll now take our next question from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I wanted to ask about just the high-level backdrop. Realized a year ago, things felt different in terms of sales and promotions. I wanted to ask you, Corie, is it getting easier to predict the business, is the visibility getting better? Meaning, are we bottoming in certain categories in terms of units? And then as you look around the corner to whether it's -- I don't know if it's promotions creating the deflation or it's consumers trading down. But do you see a flattening that the current environment we're in is starting to stabilize? Corie Barry : I wouldn't say it's become phenomenally easier to exactly see around the corner. Simeon, I give our teams a great deal of credit for working hard to catch trends quickly. I think what makes the current environment the most volatile that I've seen is the quantity of inventory at other retailers and the promotional activity correspondingly the markdowns with some of those heavier inventory levels. I think that's the part that right now makes the business a little more volatile. I think as some of those inventory levels normalize a little bit more, then I do think you're perhaps in a more normalized environment. And Matt even hit on it when he was talking about the Q4 EBIT rate. You start to lap some of those promos that we actually started to see in consumer electronics a more promotional environment in Q4 of last year.  So I think as you work through the back half of this year, Simeon, my point of view is it starts to stabilize a little bit. But I hedge that just because there's so much inventory that's in the marketplace right now, A; and B, it is still a really volatile macro environment. And I think you've got a very uneven consumer who is making corresponding choices depending on how long inflation lasts, and like I said in my prepared remarks, especially in those core categories like food, rent, housing. So I'd love to say it's perfectly stabilizing, and we can predict it, but I still think you have a lot of factors at play that are influencing consumer behavior. Simeon Gutman : And maybe the follow-up, is the promotions creating year-over-year price deflation in the categories, or is it the lack of innovation where you're already starting at \"year-over-year\" deflationary price point and then promotions are compounding that? And I guess the promotionality is the piece that resolves it or is there innovation around the corner where you -- where the industry moves back to some type of inflation? Corie Barry : So 2 pieces. One, right now, I believe the impact is mainly promotionality, because you've had really a sustained period here of a couple of years where it was disproportionately low promotionality because there was such high demand and such low inventory levels. And so right now, it really is a function of those promotions coming back.  To your second point, this is a really important part of the thesis and what I think is important about Best Buy. Our vendors who are sure are going to continue to innovate, looking for that kind of next cool product, that will continue to drive demand. And so I think my hypothesis is, it's been a little harder to have all your innovation engines flexing here in the last 2 years when you're trying so hard to produce at the levels that we've needed. So every ounce of energy has kind of been focused on production. And I think that in the future here, as especially these inventory levels normalize, I think you've got a number of vendors who are really interested in.  Now that you have this much larger installed base of connected devices in people's homes, they're also going to be very interested in how do you upgrade those devices, how do you connect those devices, how do you help a customer live in their homes, which still increasingly people are spending more time in. So I think that's the next phase, Simeon, that I believe we'll see from here, which is more of that innovation engine. And it's always been true in CE. And the hardest part is I cannot always tell you exactly what the next innovation is going to be. But we definitely know that behind the scenes, you continue to see innovations in spaces like what you just talked about hearing, in spaces like computing, with hybrid work models clearly becoming the future and some of the replacement cycles there even speeding up a bit. So I think that will be the next level. But for right now, you're really just kind of course correcting for 2 years that were very, very low in terms of promotionality. Operator : The next question comes from Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital Markets. Anthony Chukumba : I guess my question was on the back-to-school selling season. Now you talked about the fact that August was down. August comps were down about 10%. And I guess, what does that say about how back-to-school performed? And is there any read through for back-to-school for holiday? I know they're different. But I don't know if that gives you any indication or any thoughts about the upcoming holiday selling season. Corie Barry : Yes. Thanks, Anthony. For us, the back-to-school sales are actually slightly ahead of our, what I'll call, kind of tempered expectations. And it's following a trend that was really more pertinent prior to the pandemic, which is people were shopping later and later. And not super surprising given that this is a very different school year than we've seen for the past 2 years. And you probably got parents and kids who are just kind of really trying to figure out, how do I gear up for a year that at least is starting out much more in person and especially at the collegiate level much more on-campus. So if anything, it's been a little bit better than we had thought and it's following that same trajectory. In terms of implications for the holiday, I think it's less about what does back-to-school portend. I think it's more about kind of broadly what we're seeing. So we mentioned we're seeing a customer who's more value-oriented, who is definitely moving more towards some of those sale events. And so I think our hypothesis is you're going to see a holiday that starts to look a little bit more like what we saw pre-pandemic. Maybe comes a little bit later, it's probably promotional in our space. That's part of what is embedded in the guide that Matt talked about. And I think it's going to be, my personal point of view, a little harder to pull those sales into October when there's not -- remember, for 2 years, in October, we were yelling at the consumer, make sure that you get your inventory because there isn't enough. Obviously, the backdrop looks a little different there. And so I think you might have a consumer who's willing to wait, look for the deals and really look for those great values. And again, like I said, I'm not sure back-to-school is the indicator of that. I think that's just more broadly what we're seeing in the macro and in the consumer. Operator : Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Chris Horvers : So I'll follow up on the prior question initially. So as you think about the minus 10% sales in August to date and a later arriving back to school, that would suggest you still have a few weeks ahead of you. But then the October's compare much harder. So are you basically taking the 3-year comp trend and degrading it into the rest of the quarter? Matthew Bilunas : Yes. That's what the -- Chris, that's what the numbers would imply. I think 10% in August, if you think about the sequential stack of Q3 on a 3-year basis, with a comp that's slightly below a 12% that we saw in Q2, would imply that it's in the low single-digit area of comp performance for the entirety of the quarter. So yes, that's what assumes a sequential declining as the year progresses, and especially into Q3 and Q4. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then have you -- I'm curious what -- how you're thinking about sort of unit pull forward versus dollar volume? Because obviously, to your point, Corie, dollar volumes are being exaggerated right now because of the level of inventory in the market. So how are you thinking about like the everlasting question of pull forward around the pandemic and share of wallet on the unit side within the computing and TV category? Corie Barry : Maybe I'll start and then Matt can add on. I think we are watching both sides of the equation carefully, both the kind of ASP side of things and also the unit side of things. Broadly, on the whole, we're seeing a stabilization of ASPs year-over-year. And so you can imply in that, obviously, you're seeing a bit of unit decline. And I think what's interesting right now is you've still got a consumer who is spending on the whole quite a bit. I think they're being choosier, and it's uneven as to where they're spending. And so I think it makes it a little hard to answer the question exactly how much is pulled forward because you're against a very different backdrop than you were even 6 months ago.  I think what is -- again, and I'll go back to it, what for us is most compelling is that no matter what, you have a massively higher installed base that is in people's homes and people are spending more time in their homes than ever. And in a category like computing, we can already see that some of those upgrade cycles are happening a little bit faster than they were before. So that would imply, more than anything, it was more incremental purchases, and then you'll see that upgrade over time. And again, I mean, now it's been 2.5 years since some of the original computing devices were purchased at the very beginning of the pandemic. So you're going to have some compelling use case changes here over the next year or 2.  So it's a long way of saying, I think it's difficult against the current macro backdrop to make a precise indication of how many units were pulled forward and how much was incremental. I think instead, we remain focused on making sure we have the right inventory there for our customers and being ready as they're more ready to upgrade their devices. Operator : The next question comes from Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. Liz Suzuki : So regarding the pulling of the fiscal '25 targets that were originally communicated in March, what do you think is the biggest change that's occurred in the last 5 to 6 months? And is it more of the top line growth expectations that have become less attainable or the longer-term margin target? Matthew Bilunas : Yes, I'll start and Corie can jump in. Yes, I think if you look at where we planned the year to be, at the beginning of the year, we planned comps in the minus 1% to minus 4% range. And now what we're seeing is it's around a minus 11% comp for the year. It's a pretty significant sales decline, again, more around the macro environment worsening. We expected the year to come down from an industry perspective as we cycle some of the very large growth over the last couple of years. So that change of the macro and the consumer has really caused the sales to be much lower this year. So I would say that's probably the biggest impact as you think about our FY '25 targets going forward because some of the targets that also need scale to drive some of the benefits of the bottom line as well. So that's what we need time to assess. Corie Barry : The only thing I would add is that, and I said in the prepared remarks, but it bears repeating, strategically, what we laid out, we still have incredible confidence in. And that's why we want to make sure we're getting updates on some of those strategic investments that we're making. I think the baseline of where we're starting from, to Matt's point, is quite different than what we originally assumed. Liz Suzuki : Got it. Okay. So I mean, in theory, we could think about some of those targets as just being still achievable, but a little further down the line than what you originally thought given where the year is going to shake out. Matthew Bilunas : I think the premise of us continue to grow our business and drive more efficiency and profitability in the business over time is absolutely what we intend to do as we think about once the business stabilizes and operationally, the strategies are all very sound, and we're very pleased with how they're progressing. It's just that the backdrop as much than it was. Operator : Michael Lasser, UBS. Michael Lasser : Putting aside the next quarter or 2, as you look towards next year, given some of the changes that you've made, like the restructuring, the rollout of the outlet locations and other streamlining, could your operating margin be flat to up on a flat to down sales number? Matthew Bilunas : Yes, maybe. I mean I think what we're trying to do is assess what this year looks like. We're trying to, as you can imagine, fortify our business a bit and understand how do we point resources and work towards the strategically relevant important things as we -- as well as the operations. And I think what we're trying to do is continue to assess the top line environment, the macro environment to understand where sales will go next year, all the while knowing that the sales growth, the CAGR leading up to the pandemic through FY '20, the last 3 years, was over 3%. So we believe the industry, we believe Best Buy will return to growth at some point as we navigate some of these choppier waters. At the same time, we're taking the right steps forward to optimize our business and set ourselves up structurally as we look forward into next year and the years after that and drive our strategy at the same time. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is on Totaltech support. You now will be lapping the full rollout this quarter. Given some of the longer tenure of the original members, are you seeing the sales lift from those folks that would justify the return on investment? And would you expect that the behavior of those newer members will be different? And if not or if it is, would you think about potentially rolling back Totaltech support if it wasn't meeting your return hurdles? Corie Barry : So we chatted a bit in the prepared remarks and said we still like what we were seeing in terms of -- for right now, and again, we haven't even lapped a year, in terms of the engagement and the spend of the existing cohort of Totaltech support members. We also said, just like you would with any membership program, we are going to keep looking at the benefits that are included, what customers value, what keeps customers sticky to Best Buy, and we will continue to iterate on the offer. So I don't think it's as simple as a light switch, like is it on or is it off? I think there's a lot about the offer and behaviors that we're seeing that is really compelling.  And at the same time, we want to make sure that the offer is used and is engaging for customers and is over time keeping them sticky to the brand. And we said it in the remarks, it is difficult because frequency is lower in our category, so it takes us more time, especially against the macro backdrop that has changed as dramatically as this one has. It's going to take us more time to assess. Over the long term, is this doing what we want it to do? And so for right now, we like what we're seeing in the cohort of customers. It's still early. It's against an uneven backdrop. And we're going to continue to iterate on the offer to make sure, at the end of the day, what's most important is that it keeps customers engaged with the brand. Operator : Brian Nagel, Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : So I have 2 questions. Maybe I'll just merge them together. I mean, first off, with regard to sales, are you seeing any increased variability across geographically or otherwise that would maybe tie this more together with either inflationary pressures or some of the lasting effects of the pandemic? And then my second question, I guess just stepping back, thinking about the different drivers of sales. From a manufacturing standpoint, your manufacturing partners, has there been a pullback on -- through the pandemic, through the supply chain constraint, it's pull back on sort of say, driving innovation that may be changing now as some of these constraint keys that could ultimately become a better sales driver? Matthew Bilunas : Yes, sure. I'll start and then Corie can add on. Brian, I think from a sales perspective, from a geography base, I think nothing we would necessarily call out. I would say though that in some of our test markets, we are seeing good results in terms of how we're looking at our store portfolio. And in fact so, we are seeing a bit of improvement on some of our experiential stores that we've rolled out. And we've rolled out 2, we're rolling out more, and we've seen a good lift in some of those locations. And so some of the tests are yielding some positive results from a store portfolio. But that wouldn't necessarily mean it's due to inflation being different across the country. Corie Barry : Yes. We hit on this a little bit earlier, Brian. But I do think our manufacturing partners have been doing everything they can to produce as much product as possible over the last 2 years. So kind of writ large, if you think about the industry broadly. And a hypothesis would be that does make it a little bit more difficult to innovate at the pace that you would like because you're just working so hard to produce what you need to for the demand that's in front of you.  And so I think as hopefully, you start to see a more -- a little bit more normalized demand environment, that absolutely -- I can't imagine a world where the manufacturers that we work with aren't working morning, noon and night to try to think through how to innovate on the products that we have today to drive more of that replacement, more of that consumption going forward. And so I don't have an exact measurement to tell you how much are they innovating last year versus next year. But I absolutely fundamentally believe, you've got a manufacturer set that is looking to capitalize on an increasingly digital consumer who is more and more willing to use these products in their home. Operator : Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Kate McShane : I just wondered if you could help us think through the Totaltech support, not to beat a dead horse with regards to Totaltech support. But just with regards to its impact to gross margins. I know you're lapping the launch. But is it a bigger headwind sequentially? Just thinking through that maybe more people are going to come through the store for back-to-school and holiday versus maybe the first half. Matthew Bilunas : No. I'll start and Corie can add if she like. Kate, it's not a -- it doesn't -- the pressure does not increase as we get into the back half of the year. In fact, it abates a bit as you get into Q3 as we lap the launch. And so even with the higher volumes expected coming through in Q3 or Q4 from a holiday perspective doesn't necessarily create more pressure effectively on a year-over-year basis. It mitigates as the quarters progress. At the beginning of the year, we talked about how the pressure this year was between 60 and 80 basis points, and that's about what we are seeing right now for the year. On a pre-pandemic basis, it would represent about 100 basis points of pressure from where we were before. But again, as we -- as we scale that offer and we sign up more people, the pressure subsides as you scale on those sales over time when you drive more incremental product sales. Corie Barry : I think the key here is that the goal of the program is ultimately to create an offer that has further reach and has a broad appeal. And that, over time, we drive frequency and greater share of wallet with our customers. Obviously, that's going to take time. And to Matt's point, it's not that it's any more impactful. Actually, as we start to get scale, it is helpful on the Total business because you are in theory growing that frequency and growing that share of wallet. It just takes us time to get there. Kate McShane : Okay. And my follow-up question is, aside from some of the labor adjustment that you made, just where you're focused on reducing costs and better -- to better align costs with demand? Matthew Bilunas : Sure. I think we have probably a whole lot more to say. As you can imagine, we're still working through those plans, and we would want to share internally as well before. I think the $34 million termination is basically termination benefits that we took in Q2. The 2 aspects of that are the voluntary early retirements and then the workforce optimization. Those are what we've done so far. We'll continue to evaluate other actions. But broadly speaking, we're looking to understand how our business has changed over the last number of years with a digital business that's now double what it used to be in a very different looking consumer to understand where do we need to point our resources and efforts strategically and operationally to make sure we're prepared for how our customers want to shop and providing the best experience for them. And so that will ultimately provide some -- also some efficiency opportunities as we look forward, but also just strategically position us better as we navigate through some of the difficult macro environments that we're seeing right now. Operator : We'll now take our -- we have time for one last question today from Mike Baker from DA Davidson. Mike Baker : Okay. I wanted to ask about the promotions and inventories a little bit, just to follow up on that. What areas are you more or less promotional in? And it sounds like the issue to me -- it sounds like -- it looks like your inventory is pretty clean. It's down 6%, but competitors are still heavy. Do you expect that to be a situation to be rectified by the holidays? And then one last question, if I could squeeze it in. Any comments particularly on what you're seeing in terms of gaming trends within the entertainment category, which was down about 9%, a little bit better than the Total? How did gaming perform within that? Matthew Bilunas : Sure. Overall, as we said, promotionality is a bit higher than in Q2 than we expected, and we built those expectations into the remaining part of the year. What we're seeing is generally more -- most of our categories are returning to pre-pandemic levels. So there really isn't -- there's always a few areas that may not be quite back there yet. But generally, we're back to where our levels of promotionality were before the pandemic started. And that has more to do with the general amount of inventory in the channel right now that, as the consumer demand wanes and inventory increases, there's just generally the dynamic of having more promotionality. It's less around needing to mark down our inventory more because it's not in a healthy position. It is a very healthy position. It's simply just normalizing to where we were pre-pandemic. And so that marketplace competitive dynamic is what's driving a little bit of that promotionality. Again, maybe not as much as others because we started the year expecting promotionality return to pre-pandemic at some point. It's just happening a little bit faster.  In terms of gaming, it still continues to be an area where if we had more inventory, we would be able to sell it. The demand outpaces the supply as well. I think we're seeing actually some -- the gaming console side of the business is relatively flat to last year. We're seeing a little bit more pressure year-over-year from a software perspective and a peripheral perspective. But if you think about where gaming, if you took all of gaming, not just the console cycles, you took in PC gaming and you brought in VR and all the things related to a gaming area, it's actually up over 50% in Q2 versus the pre-pandemic level. So it's seeing a lot of growth over the last couple of years, although like most categories, Total is coming down a little bit on a year-over-year basis. Corie Barry : Mike, the last thing that I would add on the inventory question is, it is a -- I'm very proud of the work that the teams have done. I'm proud to head into holiday in a good healthy inventory position. And we said it in the prepared remarks, that allows us a little bit more space to invest in those places where we think there really will be consumer demand. So I think it is a really good situation to be in.  And with that, I think yours was the last question. Thank you all so much for joining us today. And we look forward to updating you on our results and our progress during our next call in November. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect.",

Please note this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Mollie O\u2019Brien, to begin today\u2019s conference. Thank you. Mollie O\u2019Brien: Thank you and good morning everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful can be found in this morning\u2019s earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company\u2019s current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I am proud of our team\u2019s execution and their relentless focus on providing amazing service to our customers during what is clearly a challenged environment for our industry. Customers have high expectations regarding service and we were pleased to see NPS improvements across many areas of our business as we continue to focus on creating differentiated experiences that customers will love into the future. Today, we are reporting Q3 financial results that are ahead of our expectations. Throughout the quarter, we were committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control while also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term growth. Our comparable sales were down 10.4% on a year-over-year basis. This represents 8% revenue growth over the third quarter of pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820, which was consistent with the growth compared to fiscal \u201820 that we saw last quarter. As expected, our non-GAAP operating income rate declined compared to last year due to the increased promotional environment for consumer electronics, the investments in our growth initiatives and SG&A deleverage from the lower revenue. Our non-GAAP earnings per share, was up 22% versus pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820. We continue to manage our inventory effectively. Our inventory at the end of Q3 was down almost 15% from the third quarter of last year. This is more than our Q3 sales decline and projected Q4 sales due to a few factors. First, from a timing perspective, some receipts came in a few days later than expected and arrived just after the quarter closed. Additionally, due to supply constraints last year, we focused on bringing inventory in earlier to secure it for holiday. So October of last year ended with an unusually high level of inventory. For additional context, this year\u2019s $600 million in receipts moved from October into the first two weeks of November. This shift equates to about 8% of our inventory. The promotional environment continues to be considerably more intense than last year. Like Q2, the level of promotionality in Q3 was similar to pre-pandemic levels and in some areas was even more promotional as the industry works through excess inventory in the channel as well as response to softer customer demand. From a merchandising perspective, we saw year-over-year sales declines across most product categories. Consistent with the first half of the year, the largest impacts to our enterprise comparable sales came from computing and home theater. Compared to Q3 of fiscal \u201820, our computing revenue remains 23% higher and our appliances revenue remains 37% higher. Our blended average selling price, or ASP, in Q3 was down slightly on a year-over-year basis. ASPs will likely continue to be lower on a year-over-year basis as promotional activity that was largely absent during much of the pandemic has returned. Compared to fiscal \u201820, ASPs continue to be higher and we believe they will likely remain higher going forward. This is due to two factors that have been driving ASPs higher for years and accelerated during the pandemic. First, category mix. We have driven material growth and mixed more into products like large appliances and large TVs, which carry high ASPs. Second, within categories, customers have mixed into premium products at higher price points. I would like to pause here for a moment and talk about what we are seeing as it relates to consumer behavior. As I step back at the highest macro level across retail, each customer is making trade-offs, especially with the significant impact of inflation on the basics like food, fuel and lodging. This disproportionately impacts lower income consumers as a much larger proportion of their spend is on those basics. Across consumers, we can also see that savings are being drawn down and credit usage is going up and value clearly matters to everyone. During Q3, we continue to see more interest in sales events geared at exceptional value. As a result, there is no one way to describe all customers and we have repeatedly referred to the impacts of the current macro environment on consumers as uneven and unsettled. As it relates to our results as a specialty CE retailer, we saw relatively consistent behavior from our purchasing customers in Q3. Our demographic mix is basically steady versus last year and pre-pandemic. Our blended mix of premium product is higher, both units and dollars than last year and pre-pandemic. Within some specific categories, we can see some cohorts of customers trading down, but it is not aggregating into an overall impact. While sales are down in our signature categories as we lap the strong growth of the pandemic years, our initiative to expand our presence in adjacent categories is driving sales growth. While still small overall, we are driving sales growth in e-bikes and outdoor living categories as we expand to more stores in addition to our online assortment. Outdoor furniture, in particular, is demonstrating strong growth driven by new showrooms for our Yardbird assortment, including in our Best Buy stores and new standalone showrooms. From a health and wellness perspective, we launched over-the-counter hearing aids last month in almost 300 stores and online, including a new online hearing assessment tool. Volume is still relatively low, but the Q3 sales growth rate exceeded our expectations and demonstrates that customers see Best Buy as a relevant provider of these products. As you have all likely noticed, the holiday shopping season has begun and now more than ever, our customers are looking to bring joy back into their holiday celebration. Like we said in our last earnings call, we expect shopping patterns will look more similar to historical holiday periods than what we have seen in the last 2 years. Specifically, we expect there will be more customer shopping activity concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday, and the two weeks leading up to December 25. Our results so far in October and the first 2 weeks of November have come in largely as expected and support this view thus far. From an inventory perspective, we have approached holiday strategically, placing bets in areas that require a longer lead time and taking a more flexible approach in other areas. We believe this gives us more room to invest and partner with vendors to changes in demand to provide additional sales opportunities. I would also stress that while November typically represents the largest influx of inventory in Q4, we will continue to receive inventory every week throughout the holiday season to replenish inventory levels. While aligning inventory levels with uncertain and evolving customer demand is always challenging, we are well positioned and feel confident we will be able to react quickly to changes we may see in customer demand. From a labor standpoint, we have seen a strong pool of applicants for seasonal associates to supplement our store team. This combined with our investments in wages over the past few years and comparably low turnover that remains close to pre-pandemic levels means we are ready to provide our customers the great service they expect to find in our stores. We are excited about the promotions and deals we have planned for all our customers, including special promotions available to Totaltech and MyBestBuy members. We have curated gift list with inspiration for all from family members to foodies and content creators to gamers. For added ease of shopping and peace of mind, we have extended both our store hours and our product return policy for the holiday season. We are also offering free next day delivery on thousands of items in addition to our convenience store and curbside pickup options. We feel confident heading into what could be an uneven holiday season and we have tailored our offerings to delight our customers whatever their budget. Strategically, as we look ahead, we are positioning ourselves to lead the way in the future of retailing. This is a future where the customer is in control and expect seamless experiences across all touch points. It is becoming more evident every quarter that the pandemic-induced shopping behavior changes are sticky and that our digital penetration of domestic sales will likely remain above 30%. For the first 9 months of the year, our online sales as a percentage of domestic revenue were 31%, nearly twice as high as pre-pandemic. We expect that penetration rate to begin to increase again over time as it did pre-pandemic. Additionally, customer demand for other virtual interactions has remained elevated and we have seen strong and sustained sales growth from our investments in chat, phone and video sales experiences this year.  Of course, that also means that almost 70% of customers are shopping in our stores and customers representing 42% of our online sales pickup their products at our stores. As such, it is imperative we continue to invest in our stores and elevate our unique experiences. One way we are doing that is with our 35,000 square foot experience store remodel. We remain excited about these as we continue to see positive results from our longer running Houston and Charlotte remodels, including stronger sales, increased customer penetration and higher net promoter scores. These stores highlight broader assortment, including the opportunity to showcase the new categories I referenced earlier and really bring them to life. The remodels also include premium home theater and premium appliances, more space for consultations and services and expanded fulfillment capabilities like larger warehouses, in-store and curbside pickup and 24/7 lockers. Additionally, as you would expect, they all include the very best, most up-to-date vendor experiences showcasing premium merchandising and specialized labor. While market conditions have created a tough environment for delivering remodels, our incredible and dedicated team was able to deliver 42 of them by Black Friday. We plan to provide a broader update on our store portfolio refresh strategy at year end. We are also leveraging technology in our stores more than ever to continue to elevate our customer and employee experiences in more cost effective ways. For example, we have introduced a new app for our associates called Solution SideKick that provides a guided selling experience consistent across departments, channels and location. With the app, associates interacting with the customer can see the customers\u2019 profile in the moment, including historical purchases and active memberships. As the associate starts an order with product recommendations, the app automatically calculates total tax savings for existing and prospective members and recommends additional product solutions. Importantly, if a customer isn\u2019t ready to buy in the moment, associates can send the product recommendations and a recap of the conversation to the customer via e-mail, text or QR code so they can purchase later at their convenience. It is early, but we are very encouraged by the ramping employee adoption of the app and the higher revenue per transaction we are seeing when associates leverage Solution Sidekick. We are also leveraging our investment in electronic sign labels to provide a better and more efficient experience for customers who want to buy a product that is locked up or not readily available on the shelf. We have added new functionality that allows the customer to scan the QR code with their phone\u2019s camera and push a button notifying they are ready to purchase. This sends the store associate an instant and prioritized notification to pick the product and have it ready at pickup. We also took a much more digital approach when building out the experience for our 5,000 square foot store pilot we opened in Charlotte over the summer, highly leveraging these digital tools. Similar to the U.S., we are evolving our model in Canada as well and continue to see better-than-expected financial results there. We have been piloting initiatives there, including technology subscription, online marketplace, a market-focused test and small store formats. This expands our testing and innovation capabilities and provides opportunities to learn from their experiences when they are able to iterate faster and are further along in their pilots. We are excited to be able to innovate and leverage learnings on both sides of the border. Turning to membership, our Best Buy Totaltech offering is a very important initiative to drive deeper relationships with our customers. Last month, we passed the 1 year anniversary of our national launch and we are pleased to report that Totaltech is driving the member behavior we envision. Members are engaging more frequently with us and shifting their share of wallet to Best Buy. Additionally, members continue to rate our experiences higher. Our net promoter score from Totaltech members remain considerably higher than non-members. Nearly half of the new members joining the program in the past year were either new or lapsed customers reinforcing that the value of Totaltech resonates beyond our existing loyal customers. Very early retention data shows renewal rates running largely in line with our original expectations. Totaltech is a comprehensive membership with wide appeal across demographics. For example, younger generations and those with children utilize more of our newer warranty and member pricing benefits and older generations utilize more of our enhanced services and support benefit. Our associates continue to love the program since it clearly provides value to every single customer and simplifies the sales interaction. While we are encouraged by the results in the first full year, we will continue to iterate based on the macro environment and what is most relevant to our customers. As we said last quarter, we have been encouraged with the pace at which we have been acquiring new customers, considering the uniqueness of the offer, the macro environment and the decline in our product sales. Nevertheless, these factors have resulted in a lower member count than our original expectations. Last quarter, we enhanced our in-store point-of-sale tools to better assist our team in showcasing the value of Totaltech to potential new members. And the early results continue to be positive. We are also activating on ways to continue to improve acquisition through our digital channel. From an optimization perspective, we will evolve the program in ways that also reduce our cost to serve. We have now lapped the financial pressure from the initial investment impact and anticipate the program to have a neutral impact on Q4 from a year-over-year perspective. Over time, we expect the program to contribute to operating income rate expansion as the program continues to build and we iterate on the offering. In the current economic environment, many consumers are facing increasing financial constraints. We believe we are well positioned to meet customers\u2019 needs in this environment. In addition to creating key promotional moments, offering competitive prices, repairing and supporting existing products and scaling our Best Buy outlets, we offer multiple financing options to improve affordability. These include our co-branded Citibank credit card, lease-to-own program, buy now pay later options and most recently, our exclusive upgrades plus program for Apple Mac books. Upgrade+ powered by Citizens Pay is a brand-new program that allows customers to acquire MAC laptops and related accessories for a low monthly fee. After 3 years, they can easily turn in their old laptop and upgrade to the latest tech while they continue paying a low monthly fee. We can then refurbish this old laptop and offer it to a new customer through our outlet stores or digital platforms. This partnership with Apple is a great example of how we work with our vendors in unique ways to commercialize and showcase their technology innovation while also offering unique value and confidence to our customers. In a different example of a unique vendor partnership, we have started a pilot in the homebuilder space through a collaboration with Whirlpool and one of the top homebuilders in the U.S. to provide and install everything from connected doorbells and thermostats to large appliances. Though early, we have delivered 5 roughly 45 markets for the homebuilder, which is giving us great insight for how we maybe able to expand the pilot. Based on what we have learned, we see this model as an opportunity to partner with numerous other homebuilders to provide them similar or expanded solutions based on our capability. Before closing and turning the call over to Matt, I would like to provide a few updates on our commitment to our employees and the communities we serve. The Best Buy Foundation\u2019s team tech centers are providing access, inspiration and opportunity for young people in the communities that need it most. We continue to expand the program with 52 team tech centers open across the country, including opening our 19 team tech center in the Twin Cities, our hometown. We also remain committed to creating an environment where all employees feel engaged and have access to specialized benefits and resources. We are proud to have women leaders at the highest levels of our company and believe it reflects our commitment to support our employees and their. This year, we are honored to rank #15 on Forbes 2022 list of the world\u2019s top female-friendly company, which recognizes companies that support women professionally and personally. Similarly, we were honored to be named as one of Forbes 2022 America\u2019s Best Employers for Veterans, our first time on that list. In summary, I am proud of our nimble execution this quarter and this year. Our teams have been navigating well through an incredibly dynamic environment and I want to thank them for their ingenuity, drive and commitment to our customers. There is, of course, ongoing macro uncertainty. And as we head through the holiday and into next year, we believe it will continue to be an uneven backdrop. Indicators remain unusually varied. The job market remains strong, consumer spending continues, and inflation appears to be slowing a bit, but savings are starting to erode. Consumer confidence is low. The housing market is cooling and inflation remains a particular concern on the basics like food, fuel and lodging, all of which have a profound and sustained impact. As you would expect, we are planning for multiple scenarios given the very unsettled and uneven consumer response to these varied indicators. We are adjusting our cost structure as we respond to current and potential future conditions. We are also making strategic decisions and trade-offs to continue to advance our initiatives. We are doubling down on our ability to lead the future of omnichannel retailer and capitalize on opportunities as the industry moves through this downturn and eventually returns to growth again. We are as confident and excited about our future as ever. Technology demand over the past few years has resulted in a larger installed base, and customers will want and need to replace and upgrade their tech devices, particularly as we near the 3-year mark since the start of the pandemic. At the same time, our technology vendor partners will continue to innovate and drive excitement and demand. We are the leading technology solutions provider for the home, a home increasingly dependent on all this technology working together and evolving over time. We are uniquely positioned to inspire and help customers with all aspects of their technology from deciding what to purchase, to installing it and getting the most out of it, all the way to helping when it\u2019s not working. We leverage our specialized Geek Squad agents, our expert sales associates and consultants, experienced merchants and sophisticated supply chain to deliver experiences no one else can in customers\u2019 homes, virtually, digitally and in our stores. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our third quarter financials and fourth quarter outlook. Matt Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you\u2019re able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results. Before I get into the details specific to our third quarter, I would like to step back and provide some context on how our financials have evolved since the start of the pandemic. As you are all aware, the past couple of years have come with varying levels of financial performance related to the pandemic impacts. There have been quarters where our stores were closed when promotions were nearly nonexistent, in quarters with higher and lower incentive compensation, just to name a few. We also saw record levels of demand as people were spending more time in their homes and receiving government stimulus benefits. And now we are living through the pressures as we lap those periods. However, what has remained consistent over the past few years is the increased penetration of digital sales, which, as Corie mentioned, has nearly doubled since the start of the pandemic. As a result, over the past couple of years, we have modified our store operating model, highlighted new store formats and rolled out a new membership offering. To better understand the financial impacts of all this change, I want to briefly give context on the decline in this year\u2019s non-GAAP operating rate outlook compared to pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820 full year rate of 4.9%. First, our core domestic non-GAAP operating income rate has slightly improved as we have made structural changes in support of our increased digital sales mix, the reductions we have made in store payroll expenses largely offset increased parcel and inflationary supply chain costs as well as our increased technology investments that are designed to support a more digital shopping experience. Over the same time horizon, our core product margin rates have remained relatively unchanged. In addition, we have also improved the profitability of our International segment, which included the exit of our operations in Mexico. Second, the investments we\u2019ve made in Totaltech Best Buy Health and our retail store remodels represents approximately 130 basis points of non-GAAP operating income rate contraction. As we have shared in the past, these initiatives come with near-term pressure, but we expect they will improve our profitability in the future. Third, this year\u2019s financial performance has benefited from lower incentive compensation when compared to fiscal \u201820. As we reset performance targets at the start of next year, this is not a structural benefit. This highlights how we have been adjusting our cost structure to navigate the dramatic changes in our business while balancing the need to invest in our initiatives. Let me now transition to third quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $10.6 billion declined 10.4% on a comparable basis and our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.9% compared to 5.8% last year. A gross profit rate decline of approximately 150 basis points was the primary driver of the lower operating income rate. Our non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $188 million lower than last year, but were 40 basis points unfavorable as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.38 compared to $2.08 last year. A lower share count resulted in a $0.13 per share benefit on a year-over-year basis. While our results were down to last year, our performance was ahead of our expectations we shared in our last earnings call. From a profitability standpoint, better-than-expected results were largely driven by disciplined expense management that resulted in favorable SG&A expense, both from a dollar and rate perspective. The favorable SG&A was partially offset by slightly lower gross profit rate which was primarily the result of more promotional environment than we expected. Next, I will walk through the details of our third quarter results compared to last year before providing insights into how we are thinking about the fourth quarter. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 10.8% to $9.8 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 10.5%. From a monthly phasing standpoint, October\u2019s year-over-year comparable sales decline of 15% was the largest decline while September was our best-performing month. Conversely, when comparing to the pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820 comparable period, October had the most growth, while holiday shopping was more prevalent this October compared to pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820, it was lower than last year, when there was more of an urgency for consumers to get products early due to supply chain fears. In our International segment, revenue decreased 14.9% of $787 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 9.3% in Canada and a negative impact of 408 basis points from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Turning now to gross profit. our enterprise rate declined 150 basis points to 22%. Our domestic gross profit rate also declined 150 basis points, with the primary drivers consistent with expectations as well as the past two quarters. These drivers include : one, lower product margins, which were primarily due to increased promotions; two, lower services margins rates, including pressure from Totaltech; and three, the impact of higher supply chain costs. These items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue from the company\u2019s credit card arrangement. As a reminder, the gross profit rate pressure from Totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous Totaltech support offer. As Corie shared, we fully lapped last year\u2019s national rollout in October. As a result, the approximately 60 basis points headwind to last year from lower services margin rates was a sequential improvement from the past two quarters. Moving next to SG&A, as I stated earlier, our enterprise non-GAAP SG&A decreased $188 million while increasing 40 basis points as a percentage of sales. Within the domestic segment, the primary drivers were lower incentive compensation and reduced store payroll costs. Incentive compensation was favorable to last year by approximately $100 million this quarter and $365 million year-to-date. Our store payroll expense, which excludes the impact from incentive compensation, was favorable to last year, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales. International SG&A was $150 million, decreased $21 million while increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales. The decrease was primarily driven by lower incentive compensation expense and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate was 23.8% versus 25% last year. For the full year, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 21% versus our previous guidance of approximately 23%. The lower outlook for the full year is primarily due to discrete tax matters in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends of $595 million and share repurchases of $455 million. We paused share repurchases during the second quarter and recently resumed repurchasing shares in early November. We now expect to spend a total of approximately $1 billion in share repurchases this fiscal year. We are committed to being a premium dividend payer based on our current planning assumptions for fiscal \u201823, our quarterly dividend of $0.88 per share will fall outside of our stated payout ratio target of 35% to 45% of non-GAAP net income. We view the target as a long-term in nature and do not plan to reduce the dividend should fall outside the range in any 1 year. From a capital expenditure standpoint, we still expect to spend approximately $1 billion during the year. As we shared last quarter, the makeup of our capital expenditures looks a little different than last year with store-related investments representing a larger portion of our overall spending. Technology and digital capital are planned similar in terms of dollars versus last year, but its mix of overall capital spending is closer to 55% versus 75% last year. Next, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of the ongoing changes in our business, during Q2, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $26 million of such restructuring costs in the third quarter and $61 million year-to-date, which primarily related to employee termination benefits. We currently expect to incur additional charges to the fourth quarter for this initiative. Consistent with prior practice, restructuring costs are excluded from our non-GAAP results. Let me next share more color on our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter, starting with our top line expectations. We are planning for comparable sales to decline approximately 10% for both the full year and the fourth quarter. The improved outlook for the full year is entirely driven by our third quarter results as our expectations remain unchanged for the fourth quarter. We continue to believe that the current macro environment trends will remain challenging for the remainder of the year. Although the year-over-year sales decline in Q4 is expected to be similar to sales decline we just reported for Q3. Our outlook implies a larger deceleration versus the pre-pandemic fiscal \u201820. As expected, the year-over-year sales decline for the first 3 weeks of November is similar to the decline we saw in October. Moving next to profitability. We expect our full year non-GAAP operating income rate to be slightly higher than our previous guidance of approximately 4%. Similar to our top line expectations, this improvement is driven by our third quarter performance. Relative to our previous expectations, we now expect SG&A to be a little more favorable, whereas we are factoring in a little more gross profit rate pressure due to increased promotional activity. For the fourth quarter specifically, but we still expect a majority of the year-over-year operating income rate decline to be driven by lower gross profit rate. There is less pressure than prior quarters as we lap Totaltech and some of the supply chain inflationary impacts. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Zach Fadem at Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sam Reid : Awesome. Thanks so much. This is Sam Reid pitch hitting for Zach here. You guys gave a lot of good color around the Q4 outlook. But I guess I wanted to just unpack things a bit more there because Q3 really did come in nicely, ahead of plan, yet you\u2019re keeping things through the balance of the year unchanged. Could you just give us a bit more detail there around your thinking? And can we interpret some of this as conservatism on your part? Or is there a possibility that there might be some differences in sequencing around holiday sales this year versus last year that might be driving your decision to kind of keep Q4 unchanged? Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Sure. I\u2019ll start here. This is Matt. I think when you look at the Q4, similar to the whole year, it\u2019s been a bit difficult to properly reflect forecast in this environment. I think we\u2019re trying to plan appropriately with everything that we see, Q4 comp sales are expected to decline about 10%. This is a deceleration from FY \u201820 growth perspective as you think about the quarters as they progress this year. The holiday, we do expect to look a little different than last year. So probably more around the sales events, so less early shopping as we saw last year, but a more early shopping than we saw in fiscal \u201820. So from what we can see as we exited Q3 with October sales down around 15%. We\u2019re seeing November\u2019s sales start around that same amount. So we\u2019re at this point in line with our expectations. Holiday is obviously quite different than it has been over the prior quarters. So I think we\u2019re appropriately planned for where we see the consumer in front of us. Sam Reid : Awesome. Thanks so much. I will pass it along. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Pete Keith at Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Pete Keith : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Nice results. Just sticking on the Q4 theme, we know the macro stuff, but let\u2019s just talk about products. What are some of the product categories looking at this holiday season, as you guys are most excited about and putting in front of your customers? Corie Barry : Yes, I think I\u2019d start with a holiday where \u2013 and I said it in the script but I mean it. I think people are really just looking for some joy in their holiday and what feels like a little bit more normal, I say that an [\u201choliday\u201d] (ph) versus the last couple of years, Peter. So I think what we see as exciting are those things families can do together. So things like televisions. And that\u2019s, again, not just the TV that\u2019s about streaming so much more content than people were before. Things like VR that take you to new places and allow you new experiences and are increasingly having more and more content availability, Gaming continues to be exciting for people. And that is a place where we\u2019re getting as much as we humanly can, but there still is some constraint, and we all know that drives a little bit of excitement. Health and wearables people really taking charge of their own health. We continue to see people very interested in taking control of health and fitness and their own abilities there and then still computing and tablets and this kind of productivity question. I mentioned it in the script. This is after almost 3 years now at the pandemic. You\u2019ve got a cohort of people now who are looking for that latest and greatest in that ability to upgrade, stay on the go, keep their life in the kind of hybrid way that everyone is living. So the cool part \u2013 an then there is all the like fun little stuff that we sell that I think people forget, the great gifts that are in things like small appliances and indoor garden, a connected coffee cup that keeps your coffee warm. There is just this incredible array of really interesting products that technology continues to push the envelope on and evolve. And I think what we love most is these are gifts that change every single year. So for the great gift giver, I think we have a lot to offer. Pete Keith : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just taking a little bit of a longer-term question around Totaltech, so you gave a lot of good information now that you\u2019ve anniversaried the rollout. When we just think about that EBIT margin accretion, is that something that we should now start to see going forward in the next 12 months or if you are running a little bit lower on memberships than you thought, is it maybe 1 year out before it starts to become margin accretive? Matt Bilunas : Yes. I think consistent with our \u2013 what we talked about at the March Investor Day, I think we expect [the backbone] (ph) for our initiatives to help improve our rate as we look towards FY \u201825. So obviously, the world is much different than it was back then, and the program has continued to evolve, and we will continue to iterate. But I think we would expect the Totaltech to help provide a bit of rate improvement year-over-year as we look into next year, but probably more so even as we look into FY \u201825. Clearly, there is \u2013 we\u2019re learning a lot around the program and looking to make tweaks to the offer as we progress this next year from all the learnings we\u2019re having. So it would be our expectation that over time, it would help improve our rate from a pressure year-over-year. Corie Barry : And Peter, I just want to make sure I reemphasize something that I said in the script here, which is the good news is it is doing what we want it to do. This is a program that\u2019s geared at those stickier, longer-term relationships with customers, being high consideration for customers and, therefore, driving up that frequency and that greater share of wallet. So I think those early indicators for us are very positive. Pete Keith : Okay, sounds good. Thanks so much and good luck. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli at Truist. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. So the additional deceleration you\u2019ve seen in October and so far in November, is that driven primarily from transactions? Or is that more ASP pressures from the heightened promotional environment? And then related to that, any feel for whether those declines are kind of across the board? Or is it more concentrated in specific customer cohorts? Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Yes. Consistent with what we\u2019ve seen this year, most of that contraction is coming from transactions. ASPs have been a bit down, as we mentioned, and we expect them to probably come down a little bit in Q4. It\u2019s more of the transactions that are causing that top line deceleration on a year-over-year basis. But importantly, too, what we said is if you think about where we sit against FY \u201820 and Q3 and as we start our growth for this holiday season will likely come a little different than it did last year and more of those sale events driving more sales later into Q4 out of Q3. So for most of that organic is coming from transactions versus ASPs. Corie Barry : To your question about customer cohort, we don\u2019t \u2013 I mean, it varies a little bit week to week to week. But in general, what we\u2019ve been seeing is a pretty consistent customer mix both versus last year and versus pre-pandemic. And when I say customer mix, I mean kind of demographically, we actually are seeing a pretty consistent mix of customers. Like I said, it can vary a little bit week-to-week depending on sales profiles and the values we are offering. But at the highest level, we are actually seeing pretty consistent behavior amongst our customer cohorts. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : We will now move on to our next question from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chris Horvers : Thanks and good morning. You mentioned some comments on 2023. Can you take us through the building blocks of margins next year? Is the basic math that we add back all the incentive comp savings this year and saying hypothetically low-single digit positive comp environment, it just becomes a leverage story, or are there still structural SG&A savings and any comments on gross margin as well? Matt Bilunas : Yes. There\u2019s probably a number of scenarios we are planning for next year, and we aren\u2019t going to provide guidance. But we try to lay out some puts and takes around what\u2019s happening in business now to provide some context. We just talked about it here. The largest drivers of our decline year-over-year versus pre-pandemic have been those investments we are making. And as we talked about, Totaltech, it also applies to health that we would expect some of those \u2013 some of the contraction to kind of abate a bit as we get into next year. But importantly, even as you look into FY \u201824. So, we would expect some of those initiatives, the pressure coming from would lessen a little bit as we get into next year, but more so even later into FY \u201825.  I think from a short-term incentive perspective, you are right, we will reset our performance tables next year, and we will likely have to add back anywhere from $200 million to $250 million of SDI expense when we reset those tables and start next year\u2019s plan. So, that will obviously be a pressure we are managing through. At this point, we don\u2019t necessarily see a lot of change to the product margin rates from next \u2013 from this year into next year. But obviously, we are early in our planning process. And lastly, you are right, most importantly, where our OI rate might \u2013 is going to be impacted by the level of sales that happened and we are still in the middle of trying to understand what type of sales environment will happen next year, but it is a large impact to how we plan what the overall rate will be. Chris Horvers : Got it. And then in terms of the promotional environment, you mentioned certain categories being more promotional than expected. Is that home theater, and computing or another category? And then as you think about what you are seeing in the market right now, some of the big retailers, other retailers have started their Black Friday promotions or any most have already. So, how are you seeing sort of the inventory in the market and what categories in particular, are you elevating your promotional expectations in the fourth quarter? Corie Barry : I think the Black Friday promotions started the day after Halloween. And for everyone, there is definitely a lot out there. I think if you rewind the clock for a second here, I actually was rummaging back through last year, and we actually said last year heading into Q4, we expected CE to be more promotional. And coming out of it, we said there were actually some categories last year that were as promotional as pre-pandemic. And as we headed into this year that we are in now, we said we expected the environment to get back to those pre-pandemic levels. I think it happened a little earlier than we thought. But in general, this is kind of how we expected that the year would play that by now we would be back to those pre-pandemic levels. And obviously, with some of the demand softening and customers targeting value, I think that\u2019s happening at even a more exacerbated rate. I think \u2013 and so there is that. We are even seeing some of this promotional intensity in the secondary channels as well because it\u2019s been well reported, there is a great deal of inventory out there in the channel. So, it\u2019s broad-based promotionality, which is a little bit different than a historical holiday where we really, really targeted against some of the certain product drive times. To your specific question about what areas we are seeing it in, we are seeing it across the board, honestly, but really mainly seeing it in some of the iconic traffic driving products, think about like headphones and wearables. And then you can imagine anywhere where the supply is really ample, we are also seeing some of that promotional activity in those spaces. And I think back to the question on like the Q4 guide and how we are thinking about it, I think that\u2019s part of what we see in the background and part of what we are trying to take into account as we look at a competitive environment going forward. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thanks so much for the great holiday. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from Liz Suzuki at Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Liz Suzuki : Thank you. Just on your last comment kind of talking about how some of the retailers have had this excess inventory. You have been fairly nimble in managing your inventory level as well. A lot of your peers kind of caught off product that this changes demand landscape. So, I guess just given that this quarter sales came in a little better than what you expected, and I know there is some timing in terms of when holiday is really expected to kind of peak. But \u2013 and do you expect to restock in particular categories? And what are you looking to have more of at this point? Corie Barry : Yes. First, I just want to say, I give our teams a great deal of credit for navigating to your point, what has been an incredibly volatile backdrop. I think the expense and analytics of our teams really shines in moments like this. So, we talked a bit in the prepared comments about \u2013 some of this is just a shift in timing. Last year, recall, inventory levels were really challenged. And so everyone was trying to bring in inventory really early, and there was lots of customer demand really early because people were worried about not being able to get the products throughout the holiday. This year as we said, we expected the holiday to shape a little bit more traditionally like pre-pandemic, and therefore, our inventory flows are moving more in that direction. And we specifically said in places where we have longer lead time categories, we placed some of those bets earlier and then allowed ourselves a little bit more ability to maneuver on those items that don\u2019t take quite as much long lead time. There are always some spotty places where we wish we had more inventory. This is almost always true in consumer electronics. I mentioned gaming consoles, that\u2019s commonly a place. And I think there has been some conversation about some of the more iconic phones and the production there and availability there. So, that\u2019s not anything that\u2019s new that\u2019s kind of typical as we head into holiday. But those will really be some of the spaces where we would add more. And what I like is that we have a lot of room to maneuver throughout the holiday in partnership with our vendors. As we think about where the demand profiles might ebb and flow, we can bring that inventory in, and we said it. We bring in the majority in November, but we replenish the whole holiday season, and this allows us the room to bring in really what\u2019s resonating with customers. Liz Suzuki : Great. And just on your comment earlier about online penetration being likely to grow as it did prior to the pandemic, are you agnostic to online versus in-person shopping or is online an inherently lower operating margin business than brick-and-mortar? Corie Barry : I will start a bit and then Matt can add in. What I actually believe that this combination of omnichannel is our strength. And not only are we agnostic, we love it when customers are using the multitude of channels that we have and that includes consultations at home that includes our virtual channels like chat and phone that includes online and that includes stores. And so I \u2013 instead of just even saying agnostic, I actually would say we want to double down on a customer, who wants to shop us across all those channels. Matt, maybe you can provide some of the profitability color. Matt Bilunas : Sure. I think over the last number of years, the team has done an amazing job adjusting for a very different way of delivering to the customers. In my prepared remarks, we talked about how the core of our rate is actually slightly up compared to where it was pre-pandemic. And that\u2019s adjusting for \u2013 nearly doubling of the online mix in addition to absorbing all of the inflationary costs that we have seen over the last couple of years. So, that gives a little evidence to financially, we are able to actually do quite well in an environment where our dot-com business can reach those levels of penetration. So, we are absolutely agnostic \u2013 and on top of it, we just want to do what\u2019s right for the customer. The customers are going to lead us to where we need to be and our model can absorb that in any type of environment. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from Steve Forbes of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Steve Forbes : Good morning Corie and Matt. I wanted to focus on computing and home theater trends during the third quarter. I think you called out in the release, the weakness in those categories on a year-over-year basis, but it looks for the category detail in the press release that the trends improved on a 3-year basis. So, curious if you could just expand on what drove that reacceleration? And then as my follow-up question, is this reacceleration part of the reason to restart the share repurchase program, or any color on what gives you the confidence to do so? Matt Bilunas : Sure. Yes, computing, I will start with that. I think it was actually a large driver of a sales decline in Q3. But compared to FY \u201820, it was up 23%. So, we are still seeing very strong growth from the pre-pandemic period. We have seen a very large growth in the installed base over the past couple of years. Clearly, it\u2019s now being impacted by the level of the normalization, if you go from the spend. We are actually seeing a good start to Apple Plus program. We are actually seeing some customers mix towards some of the latest products versus opening price points. So, it\u2019s still relatively small and new, but that\u2019s a good start. Gaming continues to be a strong growth area compared to pre-pandemic in the computing space. So, so much of the gaming world is now kind of blending between gaming consoles and the computing arena and innovation continues on, and we expect that to continue. So, still down year-over-year, but still good strength and a great opportunity ahead of us. TVs, as you expect home theater did have negative comps as well. TVs or promotions are up on a year-over-year basis significantly. A lot more stronger inventory positions from our customers. And so we are still very confident about TVs going forward. Holiday is always a great environment for TV. ASP is down a little bit year-over-year. But again, we are seeing good mix into higher television sizes and premium products over the last couple of years. So, really encouraged by what the business could offer. I think to the confidence of the share repurchase question, I think we \u2013 I think appropriately just took some time to understand the environment ahead of us on last year\u2019s \u2013 in last quarter, just to make sure we were appropriately planning for the holiday period, giving our self enough space on inventory investment and where we need to sit from a working capital perspective and feel confident about our position in Q4 and where our inventory sits. And it is an establishment of confidence on where we sit financially and as we head into next year or so. Steve Forbes : Thank you. Matt Bilunas : You bet. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now move on to our next question from Seth Basham at Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is on Totaltech. You mentioned that members are tracking a little bit lower than your expectations. You have been able to parse that out between the slower sales and demand environment versus attributes of the program? Corie Barry : Not right now, we are not going to kind of give the exact numbers and some of the science behind it. I think it\u2019s fair to say as we head into next year, we will probably give a little bit more color on what we are seeing there. And as you can imagine, it\u2019s very hard to parse out the two pieces there. I think what we are remaining focused on is striking the balance between what really resonates with our customers and accomplishes what we want in terms of share of wallet and frequency. And the cost of the program and ensuring that when we are investing in the program, it makes sense, and it\u2019s in those pieces that really resonate over the long-term, again, with our customers. And I think \u2013 I am not trying to skirt the question. It is going to take us a little bit of time to parse those things because the frequency that we have with our customers is a little bit different than some other retailers. And so as we are assessing just whether or not this program is doing what we want and to your specific question, why people are choosing to or not to enroll, it\u2019s going to take us a little bit of time to pull those pieces apart. Seth Basham : Got it. Thank you. Fair enough. And my follow-up question is on your store model and refresh program. I think you said you have 42 stores done now. What\u2019s your plan over the next year? And any more color you can provide in terms of the average sales or margin dollars lift from those stores that have been remodeled relative to the core? Corie Barry : Yes. We haven\u2019t really given the quantity of stores yet that we want to do into next year. And we actually mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are planning to give an update as we head into next year on our kind of experience refresh plan. I think it\u2019s important to note that everything that we are doing, we are trying to root in this really incredibly elevated shopping experience with this broader assortment, expanded fulfillment, best vendor experiences. And while we haven\u2019t given specific numbers, we have said we continue to see really good and improved sales results out of at least the two that have been opened more than 2 years now. And NPS results consistently in those as well. So, we continue to remain bullish on them now. We just opened a bunch of that 42 here recently. So, we are going to read on how they are performing out of the gate. But like I said, we will give you more of an update on our future plans as we head into next year. Seth Basham : Thank you and happy holidays. Corie Barry : You too. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will now move on to our next question from Brad Thomas of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brad Thomas : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask another just about the state of the consumer. Obviously, nice to see the sequential improvement in trends which I think is somewhat a function of the comparisons from stimulus and the pandemic getting behind us. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in terms of mix and trade up and trade down and comments on perhaps the trends in the appliance category where we have seen a little bit of slowdown. Thanks. Corie Barry : Yes, absolutely. If I take a really large step back, I think Matt did a nice job in his prepared remarks saying quarter-to-quarter, it is really difficult to sort through all the laps to what you said on stimulus, on stores open, stores close, promotionality, all of those things. And so instead, I think at the sequentials all get difficult. At the end of the day, we are trying to take the biggest step back and look at a consumer that we know is really facing trade-off decisions. Obviously, especially when you have inflation on the basics, like food, fuel and lodging, and we know this definitely impacts lower income consumers to a greater extent. I mean almost 70% of spend in the lowest income earners are on those kind of basics versus more like 55% for the higher income earners. So, you have got a large proportion of your spend going there. And so we know that people are looking for value across all of those cohorts, and there is no easy one way to describe the consumer. It\u2019s very uneven depending on how you came out of the pandemic, and it\u2019s very unsettled. You can see that even just in some of the confidence numbers while people are trying to sort their way. I think as it relates to us specifically, and again, specialty CE retailer, we are actually seeing relatively consistent behavior, and we mentioned this in the prepared remarks. Our demographic mix is essentially steady versus both last year and pre-pandemic. If anything, it\u2019s moved just a touch more into the lower income brackets. And our blended mix of premium product is higher, both in units and dollars than both last year and pre-pandemic. And we did that on a very specific like price point, SKU kind of level to look at where people were really opting into those more premium. Now, obviously, within some specific categories, we are seeing some cohorts of customers trading down, but it\u2019s not aggregating at this point into an overall impact that we are seeing consistently across every single category. So, it can depend like you might see different behaviors in back-to-school than you might see as we are heading into holiday here. But at the highest level, we are actually seeing the consumer behaves relatively similarly as we did even pre-pandemic, I think more so, it\u2019s the overarching decisions about how they are going to make those trade-off decisions between things like services and restaurants and vacations and goods and those base needs that they have. Brad Thomas : Great. Thanks so much Corie. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : And we will now take our last question from Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me again here. So, the question I have, just with respect to holiday promotions. Yes, and you recognize I know Best Buy want to keep this plans close to the vest. But as you think about this holiday and maybe what you are seeing already just given the cross currents from spending out there and some of the inventory positions, is Best Buy looking to take more leading promotions or you prepared more to react, what others do in the market? And to what extent are you working closely with your our supplier partners to both stimulate demand, but also start to alleviate some of these excess inventories in the channel? Corie Barry : I would almost go back to how we talked about holiday pre-pandemic. And holiday is always a very different time of the year. This is about really making targeted decisions about when, how and where any retailer wants to be promotional. And we have, I would argue, a good long history of deciding where and how within the holiday, we want to be promotional. That doesn\u2019t mean you go toe-to-toe on exactly the same items, exactly the same days with every other retailer. It means you create a pretty foundational holiday plan and then you stick to that pivoting as you see where the customer might have more interest. To your point, that means you are partnering with vendors way upstream prior to holiday to really think through what we think is both going to resonate with the customer but also hit those promotional price points that make sense. Obviously, we are committed to being competitive on price and our own data would actually say we have improved our price competitiveness, both compared to last year and compared to pre-pandemic. So, not only are we baseline, I think more competitive, we are then obviously picking those targeted. And I talked about it a lot in the prepared remarks, places where we can offer value. And for us, that\u2019s across the spectrum of price points, especially when we are still seeing consumers bear towards those more premium products, we are really going to try to offer any budget, that sense of value and we are going to, in a targeted way, decide where and how we want to play throughout the holiday. And I think that is really the foundation of how Matt and the team have tried to forecast what we expect in Q4. And with that, I think that\u2019s our last question. I want to thank you all so much for \u2013 thank you, Brad. I want to thank you all so much for joining us today. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday season, and we look forward to updating you on our results and progress during our next call in February. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. Stay safe. You may now disconnect.",

Later today, we will post a third-party transcript of this call to our Investor Relations website as well as a financial recap slide presentation. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting Q4 sales results in line with our expectations and better-than-expected profitability. We knew customers would be looking for joy during the holiday but would also be seeking great value given the pressures of inflation. Consumers responded to our compelling deals, and as we predicted, their shopping patterns were more similar to historical holiday periods than what we saw the last 2 years. Specifically, customer shopping activity was more concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday and the last 2 weeks of December than last year. Customers continue to choose us for the expertise, service and overall value we provide across all channels. Our customer satisfaction scores indicate that our talented teams and omnichannel capabilities delivered better experiences during the critical holiday period this year compared to both last year and the prepandemic fourth quarter of fiscal '20, especially within our services and delivery experiences. Throughout the quarter, we were committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control, while also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term performance. Each and every day, our management team and employees across the company are making tough trade-off decisions. Our Q4 comparable sales were down 9.3% on a year-over-year basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.8% was higher than expected. The promotional environment in the fourth quarter was more intense than last year. However, the related financial pressure was less than expected and contributed to a stronger gross profit rate performance. As a reminder, we first began to see promotional activity return in the back half of calendar 2021. Since then, it has proliferated across categories, and we would characterize the promotional environment for consumer electronics as essentially normalized back to prepandemic 2019 at this point. We continue to manage our inventory very effectively and are focused on maintaining targeted weeks of supply that we believe are appropriate for the current business trends. Our inventory at the end of Q4 was down 14% from the fourth quarter of last year and is essentially in line with our sales trajectory versus prepandemic fiscal '20. From a merchandising perspective, the largest impacts to our domestic comparable sales decline came from computing, home theater, appliances and mobile phones, partially offset by growth in gaming and tablets. Our organics were similar to last quarter with our blended average selling price, or ASP, down low single digits on a year-over-year basis. ASPs will likely continue to be lower on a year-over-year basis as we start the year until we lap the full return of promotional activity that occurred in the second half of last year. Compared to fiscal '20, ASPs continue to be quite a bit higher, and we believe they will likely remain higher going forward. As we've shared previously, this is due to category mix with the growth of higher ASP appliances and large TVs as well as more mix into premium products at higher price points. I am proud of our team's execution and their relentless focus on providing amazing service to our customers, while also managing the business for future growth, during what continues to be a challenging environment for our industry. As we enter fiscal 2024, macroeconomic headwinds will likely result in continued volatility, and we are preparing for another down year for the CE industry. We are expecting the most comparable sales pressure in the first quarter as year-over-year compares ease through the year. Based on what we can see right now, we believe that calendar 2023 will be the bottom for the decline in tech demand. There are several factors driving the expected return of industry growth, which could occur next year depending on the macro environment. First, we continue to see evidence that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger installed base of technology products and consumers' health. On average, U.S. households now have twice as many connected devices as they did in 2019. And consumers indicate that more of their tech purchases are need-based than want based. For example, in our recent surveys, the majority of consumers indicated that most tech purchases are for functional reasons versus emotional ones. Second, we will start to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech [ bot  ] early when the pandemic kick in, possibly later this year, depending on the macro environment, even more likely in calendar 2024 and 2025. Historically, customers upgrade or replace their tech every 3 to 7 years depending on the category, with mobile phones on the lower end, computing in the middle and home theater and large appliances towards the higher end of that range. Third, this is not a static industry. Billions of dollars of R&D spend by some of the world's largest companies and likely sum we haven't even heard of yet, means innovation is constant, driving interest, upgrades and experimentation. That innovation has largely been paused since the pandemic began and the focus shifted to production. And we believe there will be a desire from our vendor partners to stimulate those replacement cycles or build completely new categories going forward. Additionally, there are several macro trends that we believe should drive opportunities in our business over time. For example, cloud and augmented reality will increasingly lead to new capabilities and customer experiences. The cloud solves significant customer pain points by making it much easier and faster to transfer your data and existing device preferences to the next generation of product, which creates customer interest in upgrading more frequently. In the augmented reality space, we believe significant developments are coming that will generate dramatic change in many products over time. Also, the recent government infrastructure funding allocated to expand broadband Internet access to more Americans provides additional support for these macro trends and incremental access to broadband is proven to help fuel tech demand. And as we noted, since the beginning of the pandemic, the vendor community has been more focused on making product rather than refreshing product. And we believe the industry will get back to more of a normalized pace of meaningful innovation towards the end of calendar 2023 and into 2024. Specific innovation we expect to see this year in our larger product categories include dual-screen and foldable laptops in computing and personalization in large appliances. In home theater, beyond traditional panel innovation, we're seeing more of a lifestyle type approach to innovation. For example, there's growing popularity of new high-performance audio and video products, including TVs, projectors and speakers that more seamlessly blend into a room versus older technology that takes up a substantially larger physical footprint in the home. While all our product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, they are poised for growth in the coming years. In addition, we are continuing our expansion into newer categories like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living and electric car charging. We are the CE experts and the best place for customers to see existing and new tech and get advice and support. In our August 2020 earnings call, during the first year of the pandemic, we said we believed customer shopping behavior would be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and puts the customer entirely in control to shop how they want. And our strategy was to embrace that reality and to lead, not follow. With that as a backdrop, we are building out our suite of unique assets that deliver customer experiences no one else can, and that we believe makes us the compelling retailer of the future. As we do this, we are carefully balancing our short- and long-term initiatives given the volatile environment. There are 5 main areas we are strategically focused on. We will not dive deeply into all of them today : one, evolving our omnichannel retail model; two, building customer relationships through membership; three, incubating and growing Best Buy Health; four, removing costs and improving efficiency and effectiveness; and five, unlocking reverse secondary market opportunities. I will now provide more detail on the evolution of our omnichannel retail map. In fiscal '23, digital sales comprised 33% of our domestic revenue compared to 19% in fiscal 2020. Sales via phone, chat and virtual have also remained significantly higher. Even with that shift, our stores remain a cornerstone of our differentiation. Not only it's 67% of our domestic revenue transacted in our stores, more than half of our identified customers engage in cross-channel shopping experiences. And of course, more than 40% of online sales are picked up in stores. Further, we play an incredibly important role for our vendors as the only national CE specialty retailer who can showcase their products and help commercialize their new technology. We were already a leading omnichannel retailer heading into the pandemic. However, we knew that in order to stay relevant in an increasingly digital age, we needed to evolve our omnichannel retail model strategy. And within that, our portfolio of stores needed to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. We also needed them to become more cost efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. Over the past 3 years, we have been optimizing our store staffing model to reflect the changes in customer shopping behavior and to fuel investments in higher wages. We have also been rapidly testing different store formats and operating models. During those 3 years, we closed approximately 70 large format stores, or 7%, including 17 closing this week through our normal stringent lease review process. At the same time, we opened 4 new stores, including new smaller store formats and relocated 6 stores. In addition, we completed 44 remodels to our 35,000 square foot experienced store format. Finally, we boosted our technology development and our digital tools, including our app, to drive customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction and increased efficiency in our stores. Now I would like to provide our high-level plans to refresh our U.S. store portfolio over the long term. We will continue to close an average of 15 to 20 traditional large-format stores per year through our normal lease review process. We will also continue to scale our experienced store remodels. As we have shared previously, this format has more premium experiences in a 35,000-square-foot selling area, showcasing the very best of Best Buy. We will decrease the selling square footage and adjust the assortment and merchandising strategy in many of our stores. The shift to digital sales and the resulting lower in-store revenue, in addition to a much larger percent of high ASP appliances sales, has pressured our operating model and working capital. For context, roughly 80% of the SKUs we display on our sales floor sell one or fewer per week. In these core medium-sized stores, some of the selling square footage will be shifted into larger backrooms. So the total square footage of these stores is not expected to change materially. Our stores have multiple purposes now, and a larger backroom provides better support for other capabilities like our high rate of in-store pickup of online orders. In addition, we see significant opportunity to leverage these larger store warehouses and our supply chain expertise to help our vendor community fulfill a larger portion of their direct-to-consumer channel. In addition, we will open more outlet stores that support our value-focused customers. These stores are driving a higher mix of new and reengaged customers in addition to a better financial recovery on open box and return product. Over time, we believe we can also leverage these outlet locations to help our vendor community with their own open box and refurbished goods that are coming from other channels. As it relates to our small format pilots that focus on tech Essentials, we will continue to monitor them to determine the go-forward plan. We believe there is an opportunity for these to be growth vehicles in underserved urban neighborhoods as well as small remote markets. We're utilizing a market-based approach to evolve our stores. This means we're moving away from a one-size-fits-all model to a portfolio comprised of store formats and fulfillment solutions appropriately sized and working together to efficiently serve our market. From a timing perspective, as you would expect, we're going to phase these changes in line with how the business evolves. We view our store portfolio evolution as a long-range rolling plan, continually making adjustments each year with a sustainable annual investment over time. For fiscal '24 specifically, our plans include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing 8 experienced store remodels and opening around 10 additional outlet stores. In addition, we plan to complete 2 remodels of our medium core format. We expect to incur approximately $200 million in capital expenditures for both these physical store changes and routine store resets and maintenance. This is down approximately $100 million from last year. Of course, at the same time, we will continue to evolve our operating model to match the lower selling square footage and the ongoing evolution of our business model. Over the past 3 years, our overall head count has declined by approximately 25,000 people, or 20%, as we adapted to the shift in customer shopping behavior and in the effort to drive more flexibility. Our most recent restructuring activities will allow us to invest more in our customer-facing labor and at the same time, drive increased ability to flex labor spend with revenue fluctuations. Stepping back, we expect the evolution of our store portfolio and operating model to drive sales lift and efficiencies over time. Most importantly, these changes are necessary to relieve the pressures of a changing world, a world in which customers are in control and increasingly more digital and the cost to operate physical stores such as rent and labor are not likely going to come down. Now I'd like to talk about membership and its role in driving deeper relationships with our customers. As we said last quarter, in fiscal 2024, we will continue to iterate our programs based on the macro environment and what is most relevant to our customers. I'll start with an update on our entry tier of membership are my Best Buy program. For context, we have approximately 100 million members, with 40 million to 45 million members active per year. My Best Buy has long been a points-based loyalty program. The efficacy of points programs has been declining over time as we analyze the data and talk to our customers, we found free shipping resonated even more than 1% back on their purchases. As a result, earlier this year, we added free shipping for all purchases with no minimum purchase. At the same time, we transitioned the ability to earn points solely to purchases made on our co-branded credit cards. Our credit card members will continue to earn 5% back in rewards on their purchases at Best Buy in addition to flexible financing options. Thus far, feedback indicates that the changes are resonating with our customers. Moving on to TotalTech, our comprehensive paid membership that includes 24/7 technical support, product protection for all your tech products, special member pricing and much more. We launched it, knowing it was a bold new membership program, unlike anything else in the retail industry. Our investment thesis remains very much intact. Members are engaging more frequently with us, shifting their tech spending to Best Buy and buying more cross-category than nonmembers. Additionally, members continue to rate our experiences higher. Our Net Promoter Scores from TotalTech members remain considerably higher than nonmembers. Like we did with My Best Buy, we have been studying these customers closely in the first year of the program to really understand what drives not just acquisition, but engagement with us. We're going to use that data to evolve our membership proposition. For example, we will tailor the offer with the intention of retaining customers at increasingly higher levels, and, at the same time, explore a tiered approach that may resonate with an even bigger population of customers. We mentioned on our November call that we plan to iterate in ways that reduce the cost to serve, and we're leveraging member usage and retention data to do so. We've made 2 small changes already with more planned this year. These 2 changes were adding back restocking fees for certain product returns and removing free same-day delivery as a benefit. From a financial perspective, we lapped the financial pressure from the initial investment impact late in Q3, and the program had a neutral year-over-year impact on Q4. We expect membership to contribute to operating income rate expansion from here as the program continues to build and we iterate on the offering. In fiscal '24 specifically, we expect our membership program changes, including My Best Buy changes, to drive approximately 25 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion, which will primarily be in the back half of the year. We expect to share more details on the coming plan changes on our May call. Transitioning to Best Buy Health. The role of technology within healthcare is becoming more important than ever, and our strategy is to enable care at home for everyone. In fiscal '24, we expect to grow Best Buy Health sales faster than the base business. We also expect to drive a higher mix of our more profitable and unique service plans and deliver cost optimization in our active aging business. We expect these initiatives to drive approximately 10 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion. I want to spend a few minutes on our Care at Home solution that leverages current health, our leading technology platform that brings together remote patient monitoring, telehealth, a full support model and patient engagement into a single solution for health care providers and pharmaceutical companies. Boosted by its affiliation with Best Buy, Current Health had its best commercial booking year ever last year, and we now have relationships with 5 of the top 10 largest health systems in the U.S. These names include Geisinger, Mount Sinai Health System, NYU Langone Health and others. 40% of our provider clients launched in Q4, demonstrating our momentum. We also just began a 3-year development partnership with Advocate Health. This partnership will leverage Advocate Health's nationally leading hospital-at-home-program, providing care to a population of over 6 million people and Best Buy's technology expertise. Together, we will develop enhanced capabilities and better patient experiences for both Advocate Health and other health systems around the [ company.  ] We are excited about the momentum of Care at Home, but it is still a nascent emerging part of the healthcare industry. We are essentially nurturing a startup within a large-scale organization and leveraging Best Buy's core assets, including the Geek Squad to incubate a new business. The revenue contribution is currently very small and will take time to ramp as the Care at Home space matures and expands over the coming years. Before turning the call over to Matt, I would like to provide a few updates on our commitment to our employees and communities we serve. We know our employees and the expert service they provide are our core competitive differentiator, and we are maniacally focused on driving positive employee experience and engagement. Of course, the competitive compensation continues to be table stakes, and we've increased our store associate hourly pay approximately 25% in the last 3 years.  Additionally, external research supports our belief that employees are increasingly prioritizing human factors of their jobs, including well-being, work life balance, career development and culture, our unique way of managing our portfolio of employee benefits coupled with the intentional approach to provide ladder and lattice career movement at all levels helps counteract the market pressures of rising wage rates in retail. We serve customers in a multitude of ways, in store, in home and virtually, providing many opportunities for employees to upskill and reskill and ultimately choose the path that's right for them at Best Buy. 60% of our general managers started at Best Buy  in non-leadership role, and 94% of our general managers and assistant managers here today were hired internally. We are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry. From a community standpoint, we finished the year with 52 Best Buy team tech centers and are well on our way to accomplishing our goal of 100. These centers continue to provide young people in our communities with the access, inspiration and opportunity they deserve to help them define their futures. I am proud to say that Best Buy continues to be recognized for the many ways we are supporting our employees and communities. In Q4, we ranked 34th and were the #1 retailer on the Just Capital list that evaluates and ranks the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. in part on how a company invests in its workers, supports its communities and minimizes environmental impact. In summary, we believe the macro and industry backdrop will continue to be volatile this year. We have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro evolves. At the same time, we remain incredibly excited about our future. We believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time, and we are carefully balancing our reaction to the current environment with focus on our strategic initiatives. The structural hypothesis we laid out in our investor update last year remains true. There are more technology products than ever in people's home. Technology is increasingly a necessity in our lives, and we uniquely are there for our customers as they continue to navigate this innovative space. We are in this for the long term and believe our purpose to enrich lives through technology is only more relevant in the future. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our fourth quarter financials and fiscal '24 outlook. Matthew Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our fourth quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $14.7 billion, declined 9.3% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 4.8%, declined 30 basis points compared to last year, which is an improvement from previous trends as this was the first full quarter of lapping the rollout of our TotalTech membership offering. Non-GAAP SG&A was $241 million lower than last year and increased approximately 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.61, decreased 4%. The year-over-year decline in our earnings per share was driven by the lower operating income dollars I just mentioned, which were partially offset by a $0.19 per share benefit from a lower share count, a $0.06 per share benefit from higher interest income and a $0.05 per share benefit from a lower effective tax rate. While our sales results were down to last year, overall, they aligned very closely with our expectations entering the quarter, including our assumptions on the monthly phasing and the mix of revenue by channel. Our non-GAAP operating income performance exceeded our expectations due to the higher gross profit rate, which included slightly less pressure from promotions than we had expected. Next, I will walk through the details on our fourth quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 9.8% to $13.5 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 9.6%. Online revenue of 38% of our total domestic revenue, which was 12th consecutive quarter that our online sales mix was above 30%. As expected, December comparable sales decline of approximately 8% was our best performing month on a year-over-year basis. When comparing to the prepandemic fiscal '20 comparable period, January was our best performing month and the only fiscal month that had positive growth. Our domestic gross profit rate declined 20 basis points, primarily due to lower product margin rates, which were partially offset by favorable service margin rates and the higher profit-sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement. The improved service margin rate included a favorable $30 million profit-sharing benefit from our services plan portfolio. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $224 million on lower store payroll cost, reduced incentive compensation and lower advertising expense. Incentive compensation was favorable to last year by approximately $90 million this quarter and $455 million year-to-date. Our store payroll expense was once again favorable to last year, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales. Next, let me spend a few moments on restructuring. In light of ongoing changes in our business trends, earlier in fiscal '23, we commenced an enterprise-wide restructuring initiative to better align our spending with critical strategies and operations as well as to optimize our cost structure. We incurred $86 million of such restructuring costs in the fourth quarter and $147 million year-to-date, which primarily related to employee termination benefits. Since we started our Renew Blue transformation 10 years ago, we have been committed to leveraging cost reductions and efficiencies to help offset investments and pressures in our business. Our current target set in 2019 was to achieve an additional $1 billion in annualized cost reductions and efficiencies by the end of fiscal '25. During fiscal '23, we reached our $1 billion target. These efforts highlight how we have been adjusting our cost structure to navigate the dramatic changes in our business while balancing the need to invest in our initiatives. Savings from these initiatives are being used to help offset higher labor costs, depreciation and the add-back of incentive compensation. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.9 billion in cash. As Corie mentioned, our year-end inventory balance was approximately 14% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. During fiscal '23, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to being a premium dividend payer. This morning, we announced that we are increasing our quarterly dividend to $0.92 per share, which is a 5% increase. This increase represents the tenth straight year of raising our regular quarterly dividend. After pausing share repurchases earlier this year, we resumed in November and ended the year with $1 billion in repurchases. During fiscal '23, our total capital expenditures were $930 million versus $737 million in the prior year, mainly due to increased store-related investments. Looking to fiscal '24, as Corie discussed, store-related investments are planned to decrease approximately $100 million compared to fiscal '23. Let me next share more color on our outlook for fiscal '24, starting with the 53rd week that will occur in the fourth quarter. We expect the extra week in fiscal '24 to add approximately $700 million in revenue and provide a benefit to our full year non-GAAP operating income rate of approximately 10 basis points. The higher operating income rate is primarily driven by the added leverage on SG&A for items such as occupancy and depreciation, which are not impacted by the extra week. As a reminder, the revenue from the extra week is excluded from our comparable sales. Moving on to our full year fiscal '24 financial guidance, which is the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion, Enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to down 6%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.7% to 4.1%, a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 24.5%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6.50. In addition, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $850 million. We expect to repurchase shares during fiscal '24, however, we are not providing a target today. We will continue to assess our overall working capital needs and provide updates as we progress throughout the year. Lastly, we expect interest income to exceed interest expense this year. Next, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance, starting with our top line outlook. As we enter the new fiscal year, the consumer electronics industry continues to feel the effects of a broader macro environment. At the high end of our guidance range, we expect comparable sales to be approximately flat as we exit the year. The low end of our guide reflects a scenario where the consumer spending regresses even further from our current levels and lasts longer into the year. Moving next to profitability. Our non-GAAP operating income rate is expected to decline next year due to the SG&A leverage on expected sales decline. We are expecting to drive gross profit rate expansion of 40 to 70 basis points compared to fiscal '23 due to the following actions and initiatives. First, as Corie discussed, the planned changes to our membership offerings are expected to improve our gross profit rate by approximately 25 basis points. Second, we expect to see benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment and our omnichannel operations. Third, continued growth in Best Buy Health is also expected to contribute to gross profit rate expansion. Lastly, we expect the impacts from promotions, supply chain costs and the profit sharing from our private label credit card to have a neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to this past year. Now moving to SG&A expectations. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to fiscal '23. As we have shared in prior quarters, we expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year. The high end of our guidance assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $225 million compared to fiscal '23. Depreciation expense is expected to increase by approximately $50 million. Store payroll expense, which includes continued investments in store wages, is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales. Lastly, as you would expect, our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses to align with sales trends. Before I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the first quarter. We anticipate that our first quarter comparable sales will decline approximately 10%, which is similar to our revenue trends during the first 4 weeks of the quarter. We expect our operating income rate to decline at the lower -- as the lower revenue delevers on SG&A dollars that are similar to last year. We expect our gross profit rate to improve compared to last year, with the expansion slightly below the full year outlook I just shared. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first caller, please go ahead. First caller, please ask your question. Michael Lasser : It's Michael Lasser from UBS. Corie, you're making all these changes, it seems like in response just to the evolution of the business where, prior to the pandemic, e-commerce penetration was 20%. Now, it's in the 30% range and that inherently changes the profitability of the Enterprise. So the question is, how do you balance maintaining a strong customer experience, while trying to restore the overall margin level back to where it was prior to the pandemic? And how much customer erosion and sales erosion are you anticipating this year with all the changes that you're making to some of the membership programs? Corie Barry : So the purpose of the changes we're making is, first and foremost, to meet a changing customer. And that's why my -- I led even in my remarks around the measurement of our customer experiences and how across the board in Q4, we have actually continued to see improvement in NPS and the measurement of those experiences. The primary goal, of course, is to create customer experiences that people love. And when they want to come to the store, to meet their needs in the moment, sometimes -- and this is part of what's changed. Sometimes that is I want very rapid fulfillment of my product. I want to pick up in store and have the confidence of grabbing that product. Sometimes that is, \"I want a deeper, more immersive experience.\" And what we're learning our way through it is part of why we've done piloting and testing, and we're taking a long time to make changes, or what sometimes we get feedback seems like a long time to make changes is because we want to give this enough room to breathe, to make sure we feel like we're not eroding the customer experience. It's why we are investing more in our frontline associates, who are the ones who are right there meeting the customer in the moment. And so our priority is not just the cost side. Our priority is actually what does the experience of the future need to look like so that we meet the customer expectations, and we hold ourselves very accountable to the measurement of those experiences. On the membership side -- and we talked about it a little bit in the prepared remarks, what we're trying to figure out is the balance between acquisition of members but also retention of members. And what are those experiences, again, that really keep customers sticky? I mean the whole point of a great membership program is that you remain relevant to your customer base. And now -- I mean it's only been a year. And again, we have relatively low frequency with our customers. And so we're just getting data around what is it that keeps someone frequently enacting with Best Buy. And so it's changes to TotalTech but I think you heard us also mention in there, we see the opportunity potentially for another tier that might be a little bit more value-oriented, might be a little bit more convenience-oriented, but might have broader appeal. And so I think what we're trying to do is, that's why we also brought my Best Buy into the conversation, we're looking across the entire gamut of what we think we can provide our customers and see the opportunity for a tiered approach all the way from free where you get free shipping, which is really resonating, all the way up to a very comprehensive membership program like TotalTech where you get everything around support. So the goal here, Mike, at the end of the day is to deliver the best possible customer experiences that are important in a new world where a customer is shopping differently. Michael Lasser : Okay. My follow-up question is, quarter-to-date, you're trending down 10%. You are expecting within the guidance to be flat by the end of the year. So is the progression from down 10% to flat, is that linear, so we should be expecting steady improvements over the course of the year? And what is -- what is that dependent on in terms of product introductions, execution and the competitive environment? Matthew Bilunas : Thank you, Michael. As you said, our guide prudently assumes that inflation persists and the consumers are going -- be continued to make trade-offs around their spend. And so at a high end, the comps progressively improved throughout the year. And like I said, we will exit the year more on the flat to slightly possibly growing as the pressures in the CE industry kind of abate as we progress through the year. So maybe not perfectly linear, but we do expect that at the high end, the sales performance would progressively improve. At the low end of the guide, we're clearly modeling a more sustained pressure on the CE industry as customers feel the longer effects of the macro pressures of inflation that continue to shift some spend to the activities in travel. So that's kind of the 2 ends of our expectations for next year. But again, at the high end, we do expect our sales and the industry itself to improve as the year progresses, which is consistent actually with what -- some external benchmarking you would look at between NPD and CTA, which would also expect some level of improvement. Operator : Next caller, please, state your name and company name before asking your question. Karen Short : It's Karen Short from Credit Suisse. So I have 2 questions. I guess the first question is just, obviously, the midpoint of your sales guide is $1 billion above calendar '19, but EBIT margins are 100 basis points below. So again, calendar '19, but promos seem to be likely consistent in '20 -- calendar '23 relative to 2019. So can you just elaborate on that a little bit? And then with respect to the members that you called out, $100 million is clearly a very strong number in terms of members for My Best Buy, TotalTech. Can you just give a little color on what percent of sales those members represent? And then maybe some color on how you could better leverage that program? Matthew Bilunas : Sure. I'll start and then Corie can jump in too. I think the comparison you're talking about is this year compared to FY '20 -- or calendar 2019, if you think about our business -- for me the biggest change from this past year to 2019 is within gross margin in the 2 very big factors that have lower gross margin since that time are : one, supply chain costs that are much higher. Part of that is the online mix that has grown, and the other part of that would be supply chain inflation that hopefully, we would see abate over time. The second biggest impact to gross margin has been our rollout of the membership offering, which, during the quarters last year, when we weren't fully lapped, it was almost 100 basis points of pressure compared on a year-over-year basis. So those are the biggest impacts compared to that 2019 period, which was gross margin...  SG&A was -- rate was rather similar to 2019. And so what you do have there is you have savings compared to store labor being down. And then you have offsetting that a bit is the investments we've been making in technology and depreciation coming through from higher capital. Corie Barry : On the membership side, let me make sure I clarify the numbers. We have about 100 million My Best Buy members, of which 40 million to 45 million are active. On the TotalTech side, we currently have 5.8 million members. That's compared to 4.6 million we had last year. So those are kind of the 2 pools of membership that we're talking about. And we haven't given the percent of sales of those members, but you can imagine, it's a fairly high percent of sales between those 2 membership pools. I think we see a lot of opportunity to continue to engage with those members. As you can imagine, with a My Best Buy program that large, we know a lot about those customers. And we are able to tailor to those customers. We know even more about our TotalTech members, of course. And I think we see a future where we're able to tailor more direct opportunities, sales opportunities with them. We also can see potentially that if we look at a tiered approach, there's a whole another tranche of customers who might be interested in doing more with us and having a longer relationship with us. And now as we're heading during the second year of TotalTech, we're learning a lot. We think we're going to drive more engagement through a more personalized approach. We're working on our onboarding process for new members so they really understand what's available to them. And we're leveraging some of our existing vehicles so that people understand everything that we do from consultations, all the way through services, all the way through trade-in and some of the other offers. And then, of course, this speeds into some of our Best Buy Ads model, where we can tailor our advertising to specific audiences based on what we know about them. So this pool of customers is really vital to us, and I think we are continuing to improve the way we engage with them, and also drive their engagement back with us. Karen Short : Any chance you could just tease out a renewal rates? Corie Barry : We haven't given renewals, and we're not going to. And as you can imagine -- I mean they've been relatively in line with our expectations. You can imagine, there are some places where we see much better engagement and renewals and people who engage in things like support or who value the warranty side of TotalTech as an example, they are very, very interested in renewing. And so I think that's -- when we talk about tailoring the program for the future, we're looking for those customers who find value in some of the more unique aspects of the program and stick with the program because they see the value in that. Operator : Next caller, please go ahead. Seth Sigman : It's Seth Sigman from Barclays. Nice to talk to you. My first question is just around pricing and the promotional environment. I think the point that you made is that Q4 actually ended up being a little bit less promotional. Can you just elaborate on that? And then as you think about this calendar year, it does seem like a lot of retailers are planning conservatively in this category. I guess what have you reflected here in the guidance for gross margin specifically related to discounting and promotional activity? Matthew Bilunas : Sure. Just to recap, in Q4, we did see product margin rates lower in Q4, driven by on a year-over-year basis of more promotionality. What we did see compared to expectations is actually a little less pressure from promotionality even though we were expecting it to be more promotional year-over-year. As we look into next year, our guide reflects, I think, it's -- one of my comments in prepared remarks was the combination of product margin rates, [ city ] profit share and supply chain, we're going to be pretty neutral to the whole year. That doesn't mean that in some quarters, it might be a little better, a little worse. But for the most part, next year, we're assuming that it's a fairly neutral impact of [ a broad ] promotionality, not that some quarters might also be more promotional from a pricing perspective, the impact of that promotionality might not actually manifest in the financial pressure. Seth Sigman : Okay. And then I guess, just thinking about demand in general, there's obviously a few factors battling each other here. There's a lot of consumer noise. You also have pull forward in your category. You talked about replacement cycles. I guess I'm just trying to think about elasticity as you start to see ASPs come down, and we can't really see it on a category level, we only see it in aggregate. But are there any signs of maybe elasticity starting to kick in here? Just curious how you're thinking about that. Corie Barry : Yes. I think you started with what makes the conversation a little bit difficult, which is the incredibly varied indicator that are out there with the consumer right now, right? Everything from historically strong job markets, spending continues specifically on services even more so than goods. Inflation might be slowing, but it still is sustainably high. And it's high in some of the basics like food, fuel and lodging, right? And when the basics are where that sustainable inflation is, it does mean the customer is going to make trade-off decisions. And I think we've used the same language now for probably 3 quarters. You've got an uneven and unsettled consumer who, from a confidence perspective looking forward, is still not confident about the future. And so I think what we are trying to position ourselves for is the best possible value for that consumer when they're ready in the moment. And I feel like in Q4, I think we've played that very well. Our pricing was very competitive. Our price perception was very competitive. And so you can see in spot as there is a better deal to be had, you can see the consumer reacting. But no matter what, it's against this overlay of a consumer who's going to make trade-off decisions based on their own budget and their own life. Operator : Next caller, please go ahead. Steven Forbes : It's Steven Forbes from Guggenheim. Corie, Matt, I wanted to focus on trends within consumer electronics. If I look at the disclosures here in the press release, obviously, some apparent challenges in that category. So was hoping that you can expand on what you're seeing across the major subcategories within? And then maybe highlight how that is impacting the cadence of comp, right, that you're expecting for 2023? I would imagine part of that is improvement within those subcategories. But any color there would be helpful. Matthew Bilunas : Sure. I think generally speaking, when you look at 2023, with a minus 3% to minus 6% range, most categories are going to still feel pressure as you look at the year. Most generally would also see a progressive improvement as the year -- at the high end of our range as well. Categories are -- would be very different spots if you think about the last few years. If I think about computing, computing is still a much bigger category compared to where it was prepandemic. It's still seeing more pressure -- compared to the total, just because of the demand it's seen over the last number of years. Appliances, again, also a very big category, growing quite a bit over the last number of years as well, seeing a bit of pressure as we start to rightsize some of that spend, but also just as it relates to the housing market being a little pressure, which -- this is a category that does have some impact from that, although a great deal of -- it is still a direct purchase. There is a housing impact. So those -- TVs we would expect actually potentially for that to be a place where we could outperform the company average as we look into this coming year. We -- in Q4, we did see a little bit of ASP pressure. As you look into next year, we believe that potentially could see some opportunity as you get into future quarters. And so those are some of the bigger trends. The last one I probably mentioned is mobile phones. It had a sales decline in Q4, which is pretty similar to the company average. And if you compare it to prepandemic, a much smaller category as people are holding on to their phones quite a bit longer than they used to. But as you look into the year against continued improvement generally across a lot of the categories. The one area we have been seeing strength is gaming. We mentioned gaming and tablets as being a growing category in Q4. We are seeing more availability of gaming consoles, which is helping to sales trends. And so potentially an area where we see some more positive as we move into this next year. But again, a lot of that is dependent upon overall all demand as it's getting longer in its launch and availability aspect. Steven Forbes : That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up, maybe for you, Corie. Curious about vendor conversations today as compared to maybe past cycles or even just the depth of the COVID are -- your comments about helping them with their direct-to-consumer sales, direct-to-consumer open-box returns, et cetera. Maybe just help phrase, right, how the relationships have evolved here, and how you sort of expect them to evolve over the coming quarters and years just given the challenges that are out there? Corie Barry : Yes. This is an interesting space for us because obviously, our vendor partners they want to succeed as well. And so when we think about things like promotionality, the question we got earlier around elasticity, these are great partnership discussions that we can have with our vendors as we think about how best to stimulate the market. And I said it a couple of times, but it bears repeating, our vendors are highly incented to continue to innovate on their products and to create the new products for the future. I mean obviously, no one's going to sit on their laurels and wait for the customers to come back. People are constantly trying to innovate in a way that will drive demand. And we are really the best place to highlight particularly that new innovation. And so the vendor partnerships have continued to evolve over time with that as the backdrop. I think we often talk about the physical experiences with our vendors, and that remains important. Our partners continue to invest in our existing stores. And I think you can see some really beautiful vendor experiences in the 35,000 square foot remodels that we're doing as well as even some of the smaller stores that we're testing, where you have just a different take on vendor experience. So there still is this real investment and interest in how a vendor shows up in a physical experience. But on top of that, there are so many new spaces where we're developing some different and unique partnerships. We have developed some interesting partnerships around our membership offerings. We have developed really interesting partnerships with Best Buy Ads and how they think about the access to the hundreds of millions of customers that we have that we know very well, and they can target very directly. We have deep services partnerships in many cases, we're an Apple authorized repair facility, and we're building out that services infrastructure with other partners. And then to your point, we're starting to see some real opportunity in supply chain and fulfillment. We have a program that's called Partner Plus. We currently have 6 partners on it. Samsung is one of those where you can actually order online at Samsung and have it fulfilled in our stores. And I think there are so many spaces, especially in an industry where like we said 40% of what we sell online is picked up in store. So there is this like intricate want and need on our customer base to physically have access to that product, and we can partner pretty uniquely with some of our vendors to help provide that experience for them. And we can see a lot of opportunity for that into our future. Operator : Next caller, please go ahead. Gregory Melich : It's Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Really 2 questions. One, Corie, I think you mentioned that average selling prices are still up from where they were a few years ago. If the 3-year comp is flattish, should we assume that ASPs are maybe up 10% and transactional counts are down 10%. Would that be a fair estimate? Corie Barry : Well, we're not going to give the precise numbers, but directionally how you're thinking about it is essentially what we're seeing. And I just want to make sure I underscore 1 more time on the ASP side of things structurally versus calendar 2019 or fiscal 2020, you've really got 2 big things happening. And that is the mix and the category mix is quite different. Larger percent of our revenue now coming from appliances and large TVs. And also second, within our categories, the mix in the premium products has increased. And I think those 2 actually reflect some of the strengths of our model, our ability to really tailor those more premium experiences, our ability to deliver and install that large cube. I think it's -- sometimes it gets a little lost in some of the other inflation conversation. That's not what's happening here. What's happening here is, structurally, we're making what I think are some really positive changes within the business model. Gregory Melich : Well, I guess that's the natural follow-up. So that's the premiumization with innovation. So I guess as you go through this year in the guide and that improvement in comps from where we are now, is that improvement more based on ASP declines moderating or traffic improving or transactions improving. Matthew Bilunas : I think as we go through this coming year, there could be some -- when we start the year, there could be some ASP pressure year-over-year, but not to the extent that we compare it to FY '20, obviously. We believe that will remain elevated. And as you get into the latter part of this year, we'll have to see, but it's probably a bit of growth coming from the industry improving, which means demand is improving, which means it's probably a combination of units improving and potentially, give or take, some ASP increase. Again, we're not guiding it, but we probably see both as you -- our expectation is at the high end is that the industry would continue to grow and demand would come back, which would actually drive more units. Gregory Melich : And then my follow-up is on services, 5% of revenue. Is that basically TotalTech as a majority of that now? Or how should we think about that in terms of building that side of the business? Matthew Bilunas : Yes. TotalTech has become majority of that number as it's -- as we launched that membership program, it's replacing more of the stand-alone services sales that we would have had in the stand-alone warranty sales that we would have had. So we've seen it shift into being a TotalTech more based number. There is still stand-alone services and stand-alone warranty sales, but it's shifted to TotalTech. Operator : We will take 1 last question, then hand over to your host to conclude today's conference. Next caller, please go ahead. Scot Ciccarelli : It's Scot Ciccarelli with Truist. I know that reduction in incentive comp is a big part of the SG&A swing. But domestic SG&A was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis on a high single-digit comp decline. That's not really easy to do. So does that level of austerity, let's call it, create a situation where retention actually starts to become a challenge, especially in an environment where a lot of other retailers are actually talking about accelerating wage pressures in '23 even on top of '22's levels? Corie Barry : Yes. So what's been interesting here, and we said it in the prepared remarks, I mean our average hourly wage is up 25% versus 2019. We were one of the first to move our wages up in August of 2020 to $15 minimum almost 3 years ago. And so we've been making continuous investments in our workforce over the last 3 years. And what we're seeing, and we watch it incredibly closely, our turnover rates are really low compared to industry averages, and they're generally very similar year-over-year. And we -- I mean we've talked about it before. We might not be exactly a prepandemic, but we're still in the like mid-30% turnover range overall. And so that is exactly what we watch to make sure we're trying to strike the right balance here. We are continuing to invest -- and it's not just wages, it's also hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits over the last 3-year period as well. And of course, we're going to keep monitoring that on a market level basis, but we remain laser-focused on making sure that as we adjust the operating model, we are reinvesting into those employees that we have. And I think, for some of the key roles like our general managers, our turnover is in the mid-single digits, and we tapped before about some of the tenure that we see in our [ peak  ] slot agents or within some of our consultants. So we are very carefully monitoring constantly both the balance of pay and benefits and, frankly, some of the work-life balance and flexibility that our employees are demanding, and we continue to see it reflected, I would argue, in industry-leading turnover numbers. Scot Ciccarelli : For you when we kind of think about -- this company has taken a lot of cost out over the last, gosh, decade plus [Audio Gap] Corie Barry : Model is always evolving, and there are always new and interesting and different ways to take cost out. I would use -- 1 of the things that we've been talking more about lately is outlets. That is a unique and differentiated customer experience. And we're pulling different customers in who are finding great values and we see a recovery rate. We've said this before, that's 2x what we would see if we were selling that sideways or selling it outside our own channel. Cost reduction is not always about expense reduction. It is often about finding flaws in the experience and then making opportunity kind of out of those flaws. Many of our cost reduction efforts actually have ended up and, I would argue, better employee and customer experiences. If you take some of the TV damage work that we've done over time, nobody wants to bring home a damaged TV, and there's a huge amount of cost in that for us. And so I think what we are trying to do is continuously assess our model. And then given some of the advancements we're seeing, there continues to be opportunity. We see opportunity ahead in how we run our call centers as an example. And that's a space where we've been able to pull cost out and have better customer NPS and experiences. So this isn't -- I think sometimes it's a zero-sum kind of game that people play in their heads with cost reduction. But I think what the team is doing is really creatively finding kind of flaws in our system. And because it's always evolving, there's always something that we're learning from and evolving. So I'm really proud of the work that the team has done, and I think we continue to have opportunity.  And with that, yes, you bet. I'd love to thank you all so much for joining us today. We look forward to updating you on our results and progress during our next call in May. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and an explanation of why these non-GAAP financial measures are useful, can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com. Some of the statements we will make today are considered forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may address the financial condition, business initiatives, growth plans, investments and expected performance of the company, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Please refer to the company's current earnings release and our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs for more information on these risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting Q1 sales results that are right in line with the expectations we shared in March and profitability that was better than expected, demonstrating our strong operational execution. We are appropriately balancing the need to adjust in response to the current industry sales trends with the need to invest, so we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and returns to growth. In this environment, customers are clearly feeling cautious and making trade-off decisions as they continue to deal with high inflation and low consumer confidence due to a number of factors. At the same time, in Q1, we saw our purchasing customer behavior remain relatively consistent in terms of demographics, and the percent of purchases categorized as premium. In addition, our focus on being there for our customers with expertise and support was highlighted by material improvements and satisfaction scores for our in-home services and delivery and record scores in remote support, in-home repairs, store care, and Best Buy Totaltech call center experiences, all key differentiators for us. We remain as confident as ever about our strong position in the industry despite reporting lower sales than last year. In Q1, our comparable sales were down 10.1% on a year-over-year basis. From a merchandising perspective, similar to the past few quarters, the largest impacts to our Domestic comparable sales decline came from computing, home theater, and appliances. The promotional environment played out largely as expected. It was slightly more promotional than last year, and we believe we are now fully normalized to pre-pandemic levels from both the percent of products being promoted and the depths of promotions. In some products and categories, the environment was more promotional than we had expected, and we saw promotional levels above fiscal '20. We effectively managed through those situations in partnership with our vendors. On a blended basis, our overall average selling price, or ASP, was slightly down to last year due to the return of promotionality. While we're on the topic, I would like to take a step back and address what we believe is a common misperception about our industry, that all products we sell are perpetually deflationary. In fact, most of our categories have had price stability over time or even seen increases. The price of a product may come down in the year after it launches only to be replaced by the next generation of the product launched at the same or slightly higher price. Innovation drives price stability and often drives consumers to adopt even higher ASP products based on new technology or additional features. For example, the five-year compounded annual growth rate for average laptop prices is approximately 2%. For Best Buy specifically, we over index in the newest innovation and next generation of products, so we tend to carry a higher ASP than the overall industry. Additionally, as a reminder, structurally, our overall ASPs have also increased over the last several years due to category mix with the growth of higher ASP appliances and large TVs, as well as more mix into premium products at higher price points. Now back to our Q1 results. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was down 17% compared to last year as we lapped last year's elevated levels. The team continues to manage inventory tightly, targeting approximately 60 forward days of supply. We expect that our inventory levels will continue to normalize and year-over-year variances will more closely match our sales performance as we move through the year. In the first quarter, digital sales comprised 31% of our Domestic revenue, very similar to the last two years, and twice as high as pre-pandemic. Our \" Buy Online, Pickup In Store\" percent of sales was also very consistent, at just over 40%. Considering the speed of our delivery, with almost 60% of packages delivered within two days, we believe the consistency of our high in-store pickup by our customers really underscores the importance and convenience of our stores. I continue to be proud of our team's execution and ability to navigate through this challenging environment, always keeping our customers and their experience as our top priority. As we look to the rest of the year, we expect the macro environment to continue to pressure demand in our industry this year. However, our guide for the year implies that we expect year-over-year comp performance to improve as we move through the year and we lap the comparable sales declines we experienced last year. Based on what we can see right now, we continue to believe that calendar 2023 will be the bottom for the decline in tech demand. Matt will provide more color on our expectations later in the call. This year, we are focused on delivering great customer experiences while running the business efficiently and strategically setting ourselves up to flourish when the industry returns to growth. This includes our efforts to expand our gross profit rate, and to continue to prudently manage our SG&A expense. Now, I'd like to update you on our membership program. The goal of membership is to drive increased customer engagement and increased share of wallet over time. As it relates to our paid membership program, our investment thesis remains very much intact. Our members are engaging more frequently with us, shifting their tech spending to Best Buy, and buying more across categories than non-members. Additionally, members rate our experiences higher. Our net promoter scores from Totaltech members remain considerably higher than from non-members. No membership program is static, and we have always stated that it was our intent to iterate over time as we learned more. We've learned a tremendous amount from our members over the last couple of years, particularly that different customers value very different benefits when it comes to their technology. Earlier this month, we announced changes to our membership program that align all our memberships, and will give customers more freedom to choose a membership that fits their technology needs, budget, and lifestyle. In addition, these changes will provide more flexibility and result in a lower cost to serve than our existing Totaltech program. Starting June 27, our membership program will offer three tiers : My Best Buy, My Best Buy Plus, and My Best Buy Total. I'll spend a few minutes going a little deeper on each of the tiers. My Best Buy will remain our free tier plan built for customers who want convenience. It includes free shipping with no minimum purchase and other benefits associated with a member account, like online access to purchase history, order tracking, and fast checkout. As you may recall, My Best Buy had historically been a points-based loyalty program. This past February, we added the free shipping benefit. At the same time, we transitioned the ability to earn points solely to purchases made on our co-branded credit card. The customer and financial impacts we have seen thus far validate our decision. For example, the online conversion rate for products under $35 has increased, and our customer enrollments have remained steady. In addition, the early financial impact has been better than we modeled. My Best Buy Plus is a new membership plan built for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get everything included with the My Best Buy offering as well as exclusive prices and access to highly-anticipated product releases. They also get free two-day shipping and an extended 60 day return and exchange window on most products. My Best Buy Total is a membership plan built for customers who want protection and support. This tier is an evolution of our current Totaltech offer and is $20 cheaper at $179.99 per year. It includes all the benefits from the Plus tier, as well as Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store, remote, phone, or chat on all your electronics no matter where you purchased them. It also continues to include up to two years of product protection, including AppleCare+ on most new Best Buy purchases. Instead of free in-home installation and haul-away services, members will receive promotional offers from time to time. As we reflected on the goals of our membership programs, we made this change because we could see that many customers who became members primarily for free installation services did not stay with the program as long as other members, and had significantly higher churn. From a financial perspective, we continue to expect our membership program to contribute approximately 25 basis points of Enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion in fiscal '24. We have already begun to deliver on this expectation as the changes we made to the free My Best Buy tier benefited our gross margin rate this quarter. Now, I will shift topics to talk about our omnichannel operations. We are continuing to adapt our omnichannel capabilities to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. For example, our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multi-channel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to become more cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver the fiscal '24 store plans we announced this past March. These include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing eight Experience Store remodels, and opening around 10 additional outlet stores. Consistent with the plans we shared entering the year and incorporated in our fiscal '24 guidance, during Q1, we advanced our operating model to align with the ongoing evolution of our business model and current trends. As I mentioned on our last call, over the past three years, our overall headcount has declined by approximately 25,000 people or 20%, as we adapted to the shift in customer shopping behavior and in the effort to drive more flexibility. As a reminder, the vast majority of this headcount change came through the pandemic from attrition and our decisions not to backfill. Throughout these significant changes, we have been working hard to balance the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our employees, customers, and shareholders. At the same time, we have been investing in tools and employee development programs that increase their flexibility within and across stores. We also know that not all roles and the associated hourly pay are the same, and strategic trade-off decisions are necessary to give us the ability to flex our labor spend appropriately, particularly customer-facing labor. Based on all these factors, we have been, as we'd previously said, making multiple changes to our labor models. One such example is the recent change to our consultation program. By lowering the overall number of in-store consultants and designers, we were able to add approximately 2 million more hours for customer-facing sales associates into our staffing plan for the year. Customers are already giving us higher marks for improved associate availability in recent customer surveys. It's also important to note that we are moving away from a one-size-fits-all approach to our stores and staffing to a market-based approach. And depending on the needs of each market, we're adding, removing, shifting, or arranging the number of associates and roles needed to better and more efficiently serve those customers and to allow for more localized flexibility. Looking forward, we will continue to iterate our model to align with business trends, including initiatives such as membership and ensuring the span of control of our leaders is appropriate. As you would expect, we are also focused on leveraging existing and emerging technology to drive better customer and employee experiences across channels that also deliver efficiencies and better margins. I'd like to share a few examples around our customer care phone experience and our in-home sales team. Our customer care agents receive millions of customer phone calls every year. We recently launched a capability that uses generative AI to summarize the main points and follow ups from each call. In the past, customer care agents manually took note to capture interactions real time with customers. This new capability allows our agents to both fully focus on the customer during the call and reduces time between calls, lowering overall cost and improving agent satisfaction. In addition, this is providing us with valuable information about friction in our experiences, allowing us to continuously drive upstream improvements. In another example, we're piloting a virtual reality training and simulation experience for our in-home consultants and designers. We expect this will decrease the cost to develop and certify in-home sales teams, and elevate the specialized in-home selling skills of consultants and designers, especially those who are newer and less experienced. Additionally, these tools are always available for reference whether a team member is in a customer's home or training in a store. Now, I will take a few moments to share our thoughts on our broader industry backdrop. As I mentioned, we expect that next year, the consumer electronics industry will see stabilization and possibly growth, following two down years. I believe it's worth repeating why we are confident our industry will return to growth. First, we believe that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger install base of technology products in consumers' homes. On average, U.S. households now have twice as many connected devices as they did in just 2019. Second, we expect to begin to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the technology bought early in the pandemic possibly later this year, depending on the macro environment, even more likely in calendar 2024 and 2025. Historically, customers upgrade or replace their tech every three to seven years, depending on the category, with mobile phones on the lower end, computing in the middle, and home theater and large appliances toward the higher end of that range. We continue to see our lapsed customers returning at higher rates year-over-year, especially as customers we acquired early in the pandemic return for additional technology purchases. Third, this is not a static industry. Billions of dollars of R&D spent by some of the world's largest companies, and likely some we haven't even heard of yet, means innovation is constant over the long term, driving interest, upgrades, and experimentation. We can see the customer demand for newness exemplified in the last few weeks by the record-breaking launch of the new Zelda software for Nintendo Switch and the stronger-than-expected pre-orders for the new ASUS' handheld gaming device. We continue to believe the industry will get back to a more normalized pace of meaningful innovation toward the end of calendar 2023 and into 2024. Additionally, there are several macro trends that we believe should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, generative AI, and expansion of broadband access. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years. We are also furthering our expansion into newer categories, like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living, and electric car charging. We carry multiple EV charging brands, and we were the first retailer to carry Tesla chargers. We also launched Starlink's satellite Internet kits on our digital channels and we'll have it available in stores later this summer. In addition, we are partnering with our vendors in new ways that leverage our capabilities to create new opportunities. For example, we are partnering with Roku to make TV advertising more relevant and performance driven. The first-ever TVs to be designed and made by Roku are available exclusively at our stores and on bestbuy.com. And brands will be able to work with us to target, optimize, and measure their ads on Roku using Best Buy audience data. We also continue to build our Partner+ program that leverages our supply chain and fulfillment capabilities. We have several vendor partners, including Samsung, who are offering their online customers the option to conveniently pick up their products at their local Best Buy store. The recent launch of Oura smart rings is an example of how we partner with some of our smaller emerging vendors in a very comprehensive and unique way to drive customer engagement. Oura is a smart ring that uses sensors to track a variety of metrics to provide continuous health monitoring to improve the user's health habits. We launched the products exclusively on bestbuy.com and in 850 stores. We have an interactive demo experience with the ability to try on the rings and order any configuration of style, color, and size. We also incorporated the Best Buy store finder on Oura's website, so customers can visit their closest store and see the products in person. I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation for all our associates across the company, who continue to uniquely position us for the future through immense change. We continue to focus on providing competitive pay and benefits and leveraging flexible work models. And I am pleased to report that we maintain industry low turnover rates, particularly in key leadership roles, the vast majority of which we hire internally. It's amazing to see so many of our key leaders choosing to build the future of retail with us. And I am proud of the many ways we were recognized during the quarter for our commitment to our people and the environment. We were included on DiversityInc's 2023 list of Top 50 Companies for Diversity and ranked 17th on DiversityInc's Top Companies for Board of Directors list, reflecting our ongoing work to ensure our leaders and our company reflect the communities we serve. Just last week, we were listed on Parity.Org's list of Best Companies for Women to Advance, as well as their inaugural Best Companies for People of Color to Advance. We were one of fewer than 20 companies named to both lists this year. We were also recently named one of Barron's 100 Most Sustainable U.S. Companies for the sixth year in a row. In fact, this year, we were the top-ranked retailer. My summary is consistent with my comments last quarter. We believe the macro and industry backdrop will continue to be volatile this year. We have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro evolves. At the same time, we remain incredibly excited about our future. We believe our differentiated abilities and ongoing investments in our business will drive compelling financial returns over time, and we are carefully balancing our reaction to the current environment with a focus on our strategic initiatives and future. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on our first quarter financial and fiscal '24 outlook. Matt Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our first quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.5 billion declined 10.1% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.4% declined 120 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A was $40 million lower than last year and increased approximately 180 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was a 60 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.15 decreased 27%. While our revenue was down to last year, overall our results once again aligned closely with our expectations entering the quarter. Our non-GAAP operating income exceeded our expectations due to both higher gross profit rate and lower SG&A. The better-than-expected gross profit rate included favorable supply chain costs and benefits associated with changes made last year to our free My Best Buy membership offering. The favorable SG&A was driven by a combination of several smaller items with store payroll expense being the largest driver. Next, I will walk through the details on our first quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 11% to $8.8 billion, driven by comparable sales decline of 10.4%. From a phasing perspective, February was our best-performing month on a year-over-year basis with trends softening through the remainder of the quarter. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing, appliances, home theater and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in our gaming and service categories. In our International segment, revenue decreased 11.6% to $666 million. This decrease was driven by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and a comparable sales decline of 5.5% in Canada. Our Domestic gross profit rate increased 70 basis points to 22.6%. The higher gross profit rate included the following : First, improvement from our membership offerings. This included a higher gross profit rate in our services category, which was primarily driven by the cumulative growth in Totaltech members. In addition, our rate benefited from the program changes we made last year to our free My Best Buy offering. Second, product margin rates improved versus last year despite increased promotional activity. And third, the profit sharing revenue from our private label credit card arrangement was a benefit to our Domestic gross profit rate. Overall, the results this quarter aligned with our commitment to improve our gross profit rate this year. Our International non-GAAP gross profit rate of 23.7% decreased 60 basis points compared to last year, which added approximately 10 basis points of pressure to our Enterprise results on a weighted basis. The lower International gross profit rate was primarily driven by a lower mix of revenue from the higher margin rate services category. Before moving on, I would like to give some additional context on the profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement, which we have now called out as a benefit to our gross profit rate for the last eight quarters. In fiscal '23, the profit share was approximately 1.4% of Domestic revenue, an increase of 50 basis points compared to fiscal '20. The growth was driven by the increased usage of our card, both at and outside of Best Buy and the favorable credit environment. Our outlook for fiscal '24 assumes the profit share will have a slightly negative year-over-year impact on our gross profit rate for the remainder of the year. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $29 million with the primary drivers being lower store payroll cost and reduced advertising, which were partially offset by higher incentive compensation and depreciation. Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a little more than $1 billion in cash. Our year-end inventory balance was approximately 17% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. During the quarter, we returned a total of $281 million to shareholders through dividends of $202 million and share repurchases of $79 million. Our quarterly dividend of $0.92 was an increase of 5% and marked the 10th straight year of dividend increases. We expect to continue share repurchases throughout fiscal '24; however, we are not providing a target. We will continue to assess our overall working capital needs and provide updates as we progress through the year. Moving next to capital expenditures, where we still expect to spend approximately $850 million this year. This reflects a reduction of approximately $80 million compared to last year with lower store related investments being the primary driver of the reduced spend. Now, we'd like to discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. As a reminder, our original guide for this year assumes the consumer electronics industry would continue to feel the pressure of the broader macro environment and the high degree of uncertainty as it relates to the consumer. Our financial performance in the first quarter closely aligned with our expectations and we are maintaining the full year guidance we provided this past March. Given the current environment, we are, of course, preparing for a number of scenarios within our guidance range. At this point, we believe our sales align closer to the midpoint of the annual comparable sales guidance. It is still early in the year, so we will continue to watch the trends closely and adjust as necessary. Let me provide more details on our guidance and working assumptions. Starting with revenue. We expect Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $45.2 billion and Enterprise comparable sales decline of 3% to 6%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 contains an extra week. We expect the 53rd week to add approximately $700 million of revenue and it is excluded from our comparable sales. Our guide implies comparable sales trends versus last year improve as we progress through the year. Let me share context on that. Starting in Q1 of last year, our industry experienced the beginnings of macro pressure and the broader implications of normalizing consumer demand trends after two years of higher growth. This resulted in a 10% comparable sales decline for the full year. For the remainder of this year, we will continue to lap the industry pressure that only worsened from the first quarter of last year. Furthermore, when using fiscal '20 as a comparison, you will see that our guidance implies revenue trends will further soften in the second quarter. After removing the estimated revenue from the 53rd week, the midpoint of our revenue guidance reflects a scenario where our growth compared to fiscal '20 is slightly negative in the second quarter and regresses slightly more in the second half of this year. This is clearly a continued slowdown in revenue growth compared to fiscal '20. For reference, our revenue growth compared to pre-pandemic fiscal '20 peaked at 27% in Q1 of fiscal '22 and generally has been slowing ever since the last quarter at 4%. Moving on to full year profitability guidance, which is, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.7% to 4.1%, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6.50. Our outlook remains unchanged for a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24.5% and for interest income to exceed interest expense this year. As it relates to the extra week, we expect it to benefit our full year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points. I will review the full year gross profit rate and SG&A working assumptions that we shared this past March. We expect to drive gross profit rate expansion of 40 basis points to 70 basis points compared to fiscal '23 due to the following actions and initiatives : we expect to see benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment, and our omnichannel operations; we also expect our membership program and our health initiative to improve our gross profit rate; lastly, we expect the impacts from promotions, supply chain costs, and the profit sharing from our private label credit card to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to this past year. Now, moving to SG&A expectations. We expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase by approximately 100 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year. The high end of our guidance assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $225 million compared to fiscal '23. Depreciation expense is expected to increase by approximately $50 million and store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales. As it relates specifically to the second quarter, we expect that comparable sales will decline in the range of 6% to 8%, which reflects a sequential year-over-year improvement compared to the first quarter. Our revenue growth trends during the first three weeks of the quarter improved from April and were within our Q2 guidance range. On the profitability side, we anticipate our second quarter non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 3% or slightly higher. Lastly, we expect SG&A dollars to be approximately flat to last year at the midpoint of our revenue range. I will now turn the call over to the operator for question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Hey, good morning, and nice job navigating in this backdrop. My question -- my one question is on industry growth, this idea that maybe we bottomed this year. If you look at the category, it's more than reverted to your point, Matt, around sales trends. It looks like it's overshot in a way. And you could have made the case that this year '23 could have -- should have been sort of the bottom and even the turn. So, what gives you confidence in '24? Because once you overshoot, it's hard to determine where that bottom is. Curious if you can provide some more color. Corie Barry : Yes. Thank you, Simeon. Let me start with a little bit of the backdrop here. And I think we've been pretty consistent in saying -- we started really in Q2 of last year in saying the consumer is clearly making trade-off decisions in a very unique environment. So, to your kind of original question on the reversion, I think what we would say is we've been seeing a consumer who is, whether or not you call it a recession, exhibiting some recessionary behaviors depending on the different category that you're talking about. So, it's absolutely unusual. I think as we look ahead, we start to feel like you see the turn in the business as you head out the back half of this year and into next year. And there are a few industry sources that we're using to help substantiate that. If you look at NPD, CTA, Forrester, a lot of those have the same kind of points of view. So first of all, we're just looking externally to say, what do we see in the landscape. But I think we tried to lay out, even within the prepared remarks, there are some key tenets here that we believe underscore our thoughts for next year. One is, this idea of truly a larger install base. Yes, absolutely, there was some pull-forward in the pandemic, but some of that had to be incremental given you now have two times as many connected devices in people's homes as you had versus just 2019. So, you absolutely have this larger install base of product. And these are not static products. These are products that we can already see our vendors working to upgrade and innovate and drive. The second point that we made, which is replacement cycles. Natural replacement cycle is three to seven years. Like we said, quicker on the mobile side, computing in the middle, appliances and TVs more on the high end. But these are pretty consistent replacement cycles that we see over time. If anything, we saw them maybe accelerate a bit during the pandemic, normalize a bit more now. But on the whole, you've got products that because of their nature, you're going to want to upgrade. And then, the third is the pace of vendor innovation. And you can -- that's why we gave some specific examples in the prepared remarks. You can already start to see some of that innovation coming. I think the window that we have into our vendors would say it's more towards the back half of this year and into next year. I think we were clear in the prepared remarks to say, this is all based on what we can see now, and we're going to continue to evaluate. But as of right now, it feels like that consumers kind of made their choices about the industry that we're in, and we still feel really well set up as we start to head into the next calendar year. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open. Joe Feldman : Great. Thanks guys for taking the questions. I have a couple of quick follow-ups for you. With regard to the incentive comp for this year, can you help us out why it would go up as much as it is given it's such a challenging year? Not that you guys shouldn't get paid, but I just wanted to better understand it. Matt Bilunas : Yes, sure. First, I'll take you back to last year. Last year, we had about $455 million of favorability in incentive compensation. As you think about last year, by the end of last year, we had essentially not paid out any of our incentive comp based on our annual performance last year, a lot of which is driven by revenue and operating income expectations as you enter the year. And so, essentially we've reversed out all of that expense last year. And so, as you set new targets for this year FY '24, you reset your tables and expectations for sales and operating performance. And so, essentially just getting back from essentially almost a zero payout to a 1.0 payout, we've added over -- about $225 million of expense at the top end of our guidance, just simply reflect like a normal payout for this year because it's really more of a year-over-year impact of not paying out anything and then maybe starting the year with the expectation that we would pay out at a more normal midpoint. Joe Feldman : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you for explaining. And then, a quick follow-up on the promotional side of things. I think, Corie, you had mentioned that there were some categories that were a little more promotional than expected. I was kind of curious as to what those were. And the sort of second part of promotions, are people responding when promotions do kick in? Matt Bilunas : Sure. I think, I'll start and Corie can jump in. There are a few categories that we saw a heightened level of promotionality, appliances is one of them, computing was one of them, headphones was another. There's a number that more promotional year-over-year and in some cases, even more promotional than they were pre-pandemic. And like any year, that's not just us who are incented to drive sales. Our vendors are incented to drive sales as well. And the outcome of that actually didn't lead to strengthen our product margins in totality. So the more heightened promotionality didn't necessarily manifest in profitability pressure on a year-over-year basis, but there were a number of categories that people are trying to stimulate and drive sales because of the environment we're in. Corie Barry : From an elasticity perspective, Joe, I hate always feeling like I answer this way, it depends on the category a little bit. I think, to Matt's point about appliances, that definitely right now is a category that is a little bit more reflecting a duress customer or someone who needs to replace an appliance versus the more aspirational customer. In that world, you have a little bit less elasticity, you can imagine, because you're not going to really respond to promotions as much. Some of the other parts of the business that Matt mentioned around particularly things like home theater, we're seeing response when there's more promotionality and more value. And I think, overarchingly, what I -- from a consumer perspective, this is absolutely a consumer who's looking for value and will respond to some extent, but it can depend a bit on the category that we're talking about and what their state of mind is in terms of how aspirational they want to be within that category. Joe Feldman : That's really helpful. Thanks, guys. Good luck with this quarter. Corie Barry : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital. Your line is open. Anthony Chukumba : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if you could just give a little bit more color on the services business. You had a pretty strong comp increase in the Domestic business, but then in the International business, it was down. And I know part of that had to do with compares, but I was just wondering if you can just give us a little more color in terms of the divergence there. Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Yes, sure, Anthony. The -- on the Domestic side, the services revenue growth is attributable to the growth in Totaltech members from this point to last year. And so, as we continue to sign up members, we continue to have more revenue come through that. And that's essentially the growth in the services category on the Domestic side. On the International side, we did say that there is some gross profit rate pressure on services. They're doing similar membership changes in Canada, and that's simply a reflection of timing of those membership changes they made last year. This year, they start to cycle those changes they made earlier in their year after this Q1. So that is a reflection of some of the membership changes that they're also making, not the same, but similar to what the Domestic side is doing. Anthony Chukumba : That's helpful. Thank you. Corie Barry : Thanks, Anthony. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mike Baker : Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the membership question. And so, you're making some changes, which presumably is based on driving better profitability, yet the guidance for the profitability impact this year is unchanged, maybe that's just timing because it takes time to implement these changes. But what does this do to the long-term outlook in terms of the profitability on the membership business? Thanks. Corie Barry : Maybe I'll start and then Matt can add. We went into the year, Mike, knowing we were going to make changes to our membership program. We have the most clarity around My Best Buy, the free program, and those changes we actually put in place at the beginning of the fiscal year. But we also had an aspiration to make changes to the other side of the program. And this just gave us a little bit of time to -- before we announce the formal changes, but we had baked the assumption that we were [going to get] (ph) these changes into the guide for the year. Matt Bilunas : Yes. So, very specifically, we -- last quarter and this quarter, we've said that the gross profit rate, about 40 basis points to 70 basis points of increase this year, one of those reasons is the changes to the membership program, part of which is the My Best Buy changes, as Corie mentioned, and then just expected changes on the other parts of the membership program. And to your last part of your question, we would expect to continue to iterate and update the membership financials and expect to see probably continued profit rate expansion as you look into next year. Obviously, as you -- we still have Totaltech members that still have two years of benefits, and we'll have to honor those for that two years. And then as you get into the back half of this year, we will start to see the benefit of the changes more. And then, get into next year, we would continue to iterate and have to see it more upside. Mike Baker : Got it. Well, as someone who took advantage of the free installation, I'll miss that, but I'll take my $20 savings on the annual fee. Corie Barry : Well, we promised that there will still be great deals on installation. And we made clear that we're still going to pull some of those great deals. So, you will still see those coming. Also, please don't get too upset yet. And the other thing I just want to add, Mike, before you go is absolutely part of the changes result in impact to profitability. The intent of the changes was to understand customer behavior and then adjust the membership program based on the customer behavior we were seeing. So, in a world where you used to historically value points, but now things like free, reliable, fast shipping matter a lot more, you make that adjustment, not just because it has profitability impacts, but because you're actually learning about what your customers value and what accomplishes what you set out to do, which is to have more sticky customer relationships, increase that frequency and increase that share of wallet. So, we're really trying to balance both sides of the equation as we're making these decisions. Mike Baker : Got it. Fair enough. I appreciate the color. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Chris Horvers, your line is open. Chris Horvers : Thanks. Good morning. Two related questions. So, you talked about the midpoint for the year on the sales side, but you didn't comment on the operating margin range. And you did just materially beat your sort of gross -- what you talked about for the gross margin in the first quarter here. So, are you expecting some give back? Any comments on that range? And then, Corie, you mentioned preparing for a number of different scenarios. I guess, what does that mean? You have cut a lot of expense out of the business on the labor side. That's your biggest cost. It's still inflationary. Where you see the opportunity to sort of protect the bottom line if comps do come in worse than expected? Matt Bilunas : Yes, I'll start, and Corie can jump in. Thanks, Chris. The -- in terms of the EBIT midpoint, we did not comment on that. I think there's more moving pieces within the EBIT level between gross margins and SG&A levers that we can pull depending on where the sales trends go. The largest factor in that equation is going to be gross profit rate. And we're, obviously, reflecting a range of 40 basis points to 70 basis points. And so, in terms of where we land, we have a little bit more drivers or levers we can pull to kind of maneuver through that range. I think, in terms of the flow-through, we didn't flow through the Q1 OI beat. It's more a function of us giving us just a little bit of room to navigate the remainder of the year. We, obviously, have a wide range of outcomes for the year, and we want to just make sure we're being prudent with how we're making decisions as we get towards the more meaningful back half of the year. Chris Horvers : Thanks very much. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Peter Keith : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to just talk about the sales trend from the last couple of months in the context of the overall retail landscape. So, you did talk about a bit of a softening through the quarter, although I think February, of the last conference call, you were roughly down 10%. So, it didn't seem like there was too much softening. At the same time, retail has seen a significant weakness in big-ticket discretionary. You would think consumer electronics would be impacted by that. So, your sales can be down, but not falling off a cliff. Maybe comment on what you're seeing within your business versus what you think is happening more broadly at retail? Matt Bilunas : Sure. I can start talking about the cadence of the quarter and then Corie can jump in about broader retail. Similar to the retail industry, we did see our sales sequentially get worse as the quarter progressed. February was the best-performing month that we come in a little bit better than our -- the guidance we gave as we started the quarter, but there are a few reasons for that. I mean we gave growth number, not a comp number, so there's a bit of difference between the growth number and the comp number. We always have a few closing the book entry. So, comps in the quarter did sequentially get worse. We have, as we indicated, starting the quarter in line with the range that we gave for the first -- for the full quarter Q2, so therefore, improving from April into May in terms of comp. And so, we feel good about that range we gave for Q2 at the moment. Corie Barry : As it relates to the consumer, Peter, I think we've been pretty consistent since really starting in Q1 of last year, saying, we felt like, to your point exactly, in big ticket discretion and specifically in CE, given especially how much demand we saw through the pandemic, the consumer was going to make trade-off decisions. And it's a consumer that clearly, when they're faced with record high inflation versus 2020 in food, housing and fuel, that's going to drive those trade-off decisions. And I think what we've been anchored on is making sure we provide the best possible value and even altering and changing the membership program to make sure we're meeting that consumer where they are. And what we can see, I mean, we've always said, it's really hard to measure share in our business, right, because especially when it comes to services and new categories, it's very difficult. But what we believe is we're at least maintaining share in the industry. And so, to your point, it's an industry where the consumer is making decisions, but it's also an industry where everyone needs the stuff that we've got. It's not like these are just want-to-have products they're need-to-have products. And we -- especially as we look at those innovation cycles coming up, we can start to see this will stimulate a replacement and innovation cycle. So for right now, I feel really good about what we're trying to do to stay with the customer where they are given the trade-off decisions that they're making. And this industry is quite different than some of the others. And I think we've been pretty consistently trying to articulate what we're seeing in our consumers, and therefore, addressing their needs appropriately. Peter Keith : Okay. Well, thank you very much, and good luck. Corie Barry : Thank you. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Your line is open. Jonathan Matuszewski : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Mine is on your B2B channel or Best Buy Business. Our checks would suggest you've had some pretty big wins on this side of the enterprise as of late. Curious if you could just update us on that channel, Corie. Where is it tracking in terms of sales penetration? Is recent progress reflective of maybe any investments you've been making on that side of the business? And how are you thinking about this business performing in 2023 and beyond? Thanks so much. Corie Barry : I am incredibly proud of what our direct team has been able to accomplish, frankly, throughout the pandemic. And we haven't specifically released this as like a separate segment of the business or sized it, but its material and its growth, in general, has been outpacing what we've been seeing in the core. And I think it's a really creative approach to everything from education, which relies highly on technology, to hospitality, which relies heavily on technology, to even agreements with sports teams and facilities where any of us know, as you walk around, there are a ton of technology experiences that are available. We continue to believe this is an interesting growth channel for us. And we even talked last time on the call a little bit about our appliance business and starting to work with homebuilders directly in a small pilot that we're doing. So there's lots of different ways we're starting to -- and continuing. This has been a business for us for a long time. I think from an investment standpoint, I'm again very proud of the team has pivoted to even more of a digital experience. So if you go online and you're trying to buy at large quantity, we will basically move you into digitally the right channels to get you to the right people who can help you make more of those scaled purchases that you're looking for. So we're finding lots of digital ways to understand our customers, and therefore, target them more as potentially small business owners versus the kind of targeting we would do for a normal customer. And so, I like -- the team is doing a very nice job creating all the capabilities a little bit behind the scenes, frankly, in serving these business customers, and I'm proud of the growth that we've seen in that part of the business. Jonathan Matuszewski : It's helpful. Thanks. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Corie Barry : Good morning. Brian Nagel : So my first question, I guess, is a bit of a follow-up to some of the questions. But clearly, you managed very, very well a difficult environment here in Q1, a challenged sales quarter. In response to other questions, you said that, I think, if I heard it correctly, because it's actually deteriorated somewhat as the quarter progressed. So as you look at the business now and the performance or the activity of your consumers, what gives you the greatest confidence that this is the bottom and as we look towards '24, '25, that we'll begin -- we'll see this rebound to more normalized growth at Best Buy or within the sector? Corie Barry : I think when we talk about the confidence we have, I think it is both relative to the backdrop of the performance we've seen, which was a pullback in demand last year and again projecting an ongoing pullback in demand this year. So, a little bit different than some of the other industries. We started to see the change in consumer behavior much earlier than others. And as soon as, as early as last year in Q1, we talked about it, we started to see that pullback in demand. So, we're going to have now two consecutive years, as we talked about, of a consumer who's making some choices away from consumer electronics. The nature of the industry is really what gives us the most confidence, and then obviously, our very stable position within it. The nature of the industry, this is an industry where technology is necessary, necessary to live our lives every -- think about the quantity of pieces of technology you touch in any given day, and that technology is not static. If you think about how quickly both the hardware and then if you think about what I will call \"the software\" things like generative AI or like VR and AR, how much that is changing, that will all drive form, feature changes in the product, which is part of what underlies our confidence. At some point people want to -- and we know this based on lots of history through recessions, through lots of different types of industry performance, people will upgrade and want to replace their equipment and their consumer electronics. And so, I think what gives us confidence is understanding that there is a very large vendor community out there that is very interested in continuing to stimulate demand, continuing to create really cool solutions for our customers. And that, over time, I don't see a world where we rely less on technology. And so that -- it is all those underpinnings that are giving us confidence as we head out of this year and into next year. Now we said that -- and I'll repeat it, that is based on what we can see today, it's based on the environment as we understand it today. So, of course, we're going to continue to monitor and see how consumers navigate what is, obviously, a very volatile environment, but that underpinning of how different this industry is versus any others in terms of both need and constant innovation, that is the biggest part that underscores, and then obviously, our position within it and how confident we feel in our partnership with our vendors, that is what gives us the confidence as we head into next year. Brian Nagel : That's very helpful, Corie. Thank you. And then if I could just ask a quick follow-up unrelated. So, a lot of talk about membership and some of the shifts you're making there with the program. So, I guess as we step back, I mean, clearly, Best Buy, there's a revenue piece of the membership program, how do customers that are members of Best Buy, how do they perform versus non-member customers from just from an overall sales perspective? Corie Barry : Yes. We hit out a little bit in the prepared remarks, but they remain more engaged customers. They tend to spend more, they tend to shop across categories, they tend -- on the whole, so I'm just going to talk about this big kind of lump of members, they tend to be our most engaged customers. Now, what a couple of years of paid membership has given us though is a lot of data around what is it customers distinctly value. Because there's really three things you're trying to do with any membership program : you're trying to acquire customers, you're trying to retain customers, and you're constantly trying to engage customers. Acquisition, retention and engagement are the cornerstones of any membership program. And so, Brian, what we've been spending time on is not just who are we acquiring, but do they stay engaged with the program? Are we retaining them? And so, it's not just about kind of the full, here's what we see in our customers. They're, for sure, more engaged and they're having better experiences. But now we can start to kind of bifurcate that large customer base into different need states. And we definitely see a customer who's really oriented around value and convenience, and we definitely see a customer who's really oriented around more fulsome service and support. And this gives us the opportunity, given all the now very rich customer data we have, to start to target each of those kind of populations of customers based on a more tailored offering that we believe will resonate with them. Brian Nagel : Got it. I appreciate all the color. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is around store labor. You guys have made a lot of changes to the labor model over the last year or two, and you're continuing to iterate. I'd like to get a sense from you as to what you think the status is of morale within the labor force? And then secondly, whether or not the lack of the specialized roles could impact customer service levels in a negative way? Corie Barry : Yes, I'm going to start with the second part of the question, I'll work my way backwards. There is still very specialized labor in our stores. And we are very proud of that, and we are working very hard to make sure that we retain and continue to develop that very specialized experience over time. I think what we're trying to do is make sure that we are most effectively matching our labor, some of which is specialized, like any retailer, some of which is more kind of part-time and generalized in nature, that we are matching that specifically with how many and what type of people are coming into our stores and what it is that they need. And so, we have continued to obviously invest in wages. We were one of the first to go to a minimum $15. Our hourly wages are up more than 25% versus pre-pandemic. We're overarchingly investing hundreds of millions of dollars in benefits, and also, importantly, investing in career development and culture. And then really doing a lot of work to make sure we are bringing our employees along as we make these changes, involving them in the decisions and really trying to make sure that they feel like they also have a voice. And I think, how do we measure that? Well, one way is, obviously, we're looking at turnover, and we're pretty constantly looking at turnover. And we believe our general approach is working. Our turnover remains very low versus retail averages. It's consistent year-over-year. It is incredibly low in some of the most key areas like our general managers, where our turnover is in the mid-single digits, even given everything that RGMs have gone through in the last four years in particular. And I think that is one of the indicators. A second indicator, we continue to see a very high level of applications. Our applications have grown substantially year-over-year. So, you're seeing people want to come into the business, which is a good sign, because that means that GMs are pulling them into the business. And then third, you can imagine, we measure employee engagement. And we measure it very consistently. And not just at the high level, like here's the number. We're looking literally regionally, store-by-store, distribution center by distribution center, how engaged are our employees? And what can we do? How do we read those verbatims? How do we pull the themes? So, we are doing everything we can to create the most engaged workforce. So, it is constant work. It is not easy for our employees to go through this level of constant change, and I am incredibly proud that so many are choosing to stay with us and continue to build this culture for the future. Seth Basham : Great. Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. Steven Forbes : Good morning, Corie and Matt. Maybe just a high-level question on ROIC. Curious if you could update us on your various initiatives, inclusive of space allocation utilization. And then, where do you see ROIC stabilizing sort of as we work our way through this normalization period? I don't know if you could sort of reference a pre-COVID level, mid 20%s. Any thoughts on where we sort of stabilize ROIC? Matt Bilunas : Yes, sure. I think, at the highest level, our ROIC is impacted by the level of profitability that's flowing through that calculation. And I think where we're pointed is at continuing to make improvements in our operating model and our efficiency. As we've talked about, as we look into the next few years, we've said that we expect and want to continue to grow our operating income rate, at the same time, the industry will begin, we believe, turnaround, and we'll continue to grow in sales and our OI rate will continue to improve as we look forward or expected to. With that happening, we'll be able to drive a better profitability and that ROIC will start to climb probably back up closer to where we were, but again, that's through a combination of the industry improving, our initiatives continuing to improve and creating efficiencies and optimization through our business. Corie Barry : I think we have a great history, I would argue, in optimizing ROIC and making those educated bets. I would use even our store footprint as an example, things like our Experience stores, our outlets. There's a reason that we are pursuing those with vigor. And you can imagine what we're seeing in terms of return on those investments is giving us a lot of confidence into the future. There're other places where we're still testing and trying to make sure we feel like that ROIC is in line. So I think we're point to that continuing to drive that return for our investors. And with that, I think that was our last question. So thank you for joining us today. I hope that many of the investors for listening today will be able to join us for our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which will be held virtually on June 14. So, thank you, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you so much for joining us. Today we are reporting better-than-expected Q2 financial results. Our comparable sales came in at the high end of our guidance and profitability was better than expected. These results continue to demonstrate our strong operational execution as we balance our reaction to the current industry sales pressure with our ongoing strategic investments. As expected, our year-over-year comparable sales performance improved from the 10% decline we reported last quarter. For the second quarter, comparable sales were down 6.2%. We expanded our Q2 gross profit rate 110 basis points from last year due to better product margins and profitability improvements in our membership program. We kept our SG&A expenses flat while absorbing higher incentive compensation expenses than we recorded last year. Our industry continues to experience lower consumer demand due to the pandemic pull-forward of tech purchases and the shift back into services spend outside the home like travel and entertainment. In addition, of course, persistent inflation has impacted spending decisions for a substantial part of the population. I continue to be incredibly proud of the way our teams are managing the business today and preparing for our future in light of the industry pressure and ongoing uncertain macro conditions. We strategically managed our promotional plan and we're price-competitive in an environment where consumers are very deal focused and the level of industry promotions and discounts were above last year and often and above pre-pandemic fiscal '20. In the first half of the year, our purchasing, customer behavior has remained relatively consistent in terms of demographics and the percent of purchases categorized as premium. Our inventory at the end of the quarter was down compared to last year in line with our sales decline as the team continues to manage inventory strategically targeting approximately 60 days of forward supply. Our customer satisfaction with product availability has been improving over the past few years and is now the highest it has been since the start of the pandemic. I would note that while we were not a perfect inventory levels last year, we were more rightsized than many and are not lapping the kind of clearance pressure that other retailers experienced. We continue to make it easy and enjoyable for consumers to get the best tech and premier expert service when they want it through our online store and in-home experiences. Almost one-third of our domestic revenue came from our digital assets including our mobile app. We have made considerable improvements to our app customer experience and the percent of our online sales coming through the app has doubled in just the last three years to more than 20% of our online revenue. We are pleased to see higher app usage overall as our app customers engage three times more often than customers engaging with us on other digital platforms. Our Buy Online Pickup In Store percent of online sales continues to be just over 40%, considering the speed of our delivery with almost 60% of packages delivered within two days, we believe the consistency of our high rate of instore pickup by our customers truly underscores the importance of the combination of our digital and physical locations. In addition, our focus on providing customers with expertise and support continues to be highlighted by material improvements and satisfaction scores for our in-store and in-home tech services as well as our home delivery experience. In fact, our remote support services, where we have the ability to remotely access and fixed your computer while you're at home has the highest NPS of all our experiences and continues to increase. These are all services we can provide at scale that no one else can. Our tech services play a material role in our unique membership program that is driving increased customer engagements and increased share of wallet. As we would expect, paid members also report much higher customer satisfaction than nonmembers. During the quarter, we successfully launched significant changes to our program designed to give customers more freedom to choose a membership that fits their technology needs, budget, and lifestyle. In addition, we wanted to build in more flexibility and drive a lower cost to serve than our previous Total Tech program. We now offer three tears; My Best Buy, My Best Buy Plus, and My Best Buy Total. It is of course very early as we only launched the new programs on June 27th, but we are seeing indicators that the program changes are driving many of the results we expect it, including an uptick in year-over-year growth of overall paid membership sign-ups. For example, My Best Buy Total, which is the evolution of our prior Total Tech offer continues to resonate more strongly in our physical stores setting. As a reminder, this tier is $179.99 per year and includes Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store remote phone or chat on all your electronics, no matter where you purchase them. It also includes two years of product protection, including AppleCare Plus on most new Best Buy purchases. In addition, it includes all the benefits included in My Best Buy Plus. And as a reminder, My Best Buy Plus is a new membership tier built for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get exclusive prices and access to highly-anticipated product releases. They also get free two-day shipping and an extended 60-day return in exchange window on most products. In the first several weeks since launch, this plan is resonating more with digital customers and appeals to a broader set of customer segments across more product categories than My Best Buy Total, and its predecessor, Total Tech. We are still very early in the process and are testing different promotional offers to determine what resonates most with consumers and continuously improving the digital experience to make it even easier to find deals and benefits. Lastly, our My Best Buy tier remains our free plan built for customers who want convenience. It includes free shipping with no minimum purchase and other benefits associated with a member account like online access to purchase history, order tracking, and fast checkout. At the beginning of the year, we added the free shipping benefit and phased out the points-based rewards benefit for non-credit card holders. As a reminder, our credit card holders still have the option to earn 5% back in rewards or choose 12 months, 18 months, or even 24 months of 0% interest-rate financing depending on the product category. The customer metrics continue to validate our decisions to change our free tier and our customer enrollments have remained steady. In addition, the financial impact has been better than we originally modeled. For fiscal '24, we now expect our three-tiered membership program to contribute at least 25 basis points of Enterprise Year-over-Year operating income rate expansion, which is consistent with what we have seen in the first half of the year. During the quarter, we continue to make progress on our journey to evolve our omnichannel capability. We want to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. This means our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to be more cost and capital-efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver the fiscal '24 physical store plans we announced at the beginning of the year. These include closing 20 to 30 stores, implementing eight large-format 35,000-square-foot Experience Store remodels, and expanding our outlet stores from 19 to around 25. In addition, of course, we are continuing to refresh our stores. For fiscal '24, we are particularly focused on improving the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the shopping floor. For example, in all our stores, we are installing new premium end-caps in partnership with key vendors that will improve the merchandising in the center of the store. These new end-caps have that product and vendor story on the front with the inventory tucked in on the sides. Importantly, it allows us to have a great demo or presentation, even if we are displaying potentially less in-store inventory than we historically have. This also allows for a much better merchandising experience for products that we have deemed more at risk for shrink and have decided to hold inventory in a more secure location off the sales floor. We invested in digital tools that allow the customer to quickly scan and pick up this inventory in a matter of minutes through our prioritized pick process. This minimizes shrink, prioritizes the customer experience, and drives a much more efficient employee process. In addition, in about half our stores we are rightsizing our traditional gaming and digital imaging spaces to allow for the expansion of growing categories like PC gaming and newer offerings such as green works cordless power tools, wellness products like the Oura Ring, Epson short throw-projectors, e-bikes and scooters, and Lovesac home furnishing products. While small, we are seeing promising results in some of these new categories with meaningful market-share growth. As it relates to the operating model in our stores, we are continuing to drive our evolution based on two overarching goals. First, we needed to more efficiently allocate our labor cost considering the higher online sales have resulted in a decline in physical store traffic and sales. Our customers and their expectations and behaviors have changed dramatically and incredibly quickly. We have been working hard to balance the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our customers and employees. In our roles and the associated hourly pay are the same and we have had to make some difficult but strategic decisions to give us the ability to flex our labor spend appropriately. As we mentioned last quarter, with our most recent changes, we were able to add approximately 2 million additional hours for customer-facing sales associates into our staffing plan for the year and we saw improvements in our associate availability NPS metric in the second quarter as a result. Because of these structural changes, we have driven more than 100 basis points of rate improvement in domestic store labor expense as a percent of revenue compared to fiscal '20. Additionally, we have been successful in keeping our labor rates steady as a percent of revenue, even as our sales have declined over the past several quarters. Second, we need to provide our employees flexibility, predictability, and opportunities to gain more skills. We have been investing in tools and employee development programs that increase their flexibility within and across stores. As you would expect, we are also focused on leveraging existing and emerging technology to drive better customer and employee experiences across channels. We are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry, particularly in key leadership roles. The vast majority of which we hire internally. Our retail workforce has led through significant change over the past four years. I could not be more proud of how our teams have adapted to the changing environment. But all that change, while necessary can be hard and disruptive for any team. We are pleased to be headed into a period of stability from an operating model perspective and we are now laser-focused on ensuring foundational retail excellence. As such, during Q2, we led thousands of employees, including more than 80% of our sales associates through a certification process, focused on our baseline expectations for interacting with customers, our selling model, and product category proficiency. This is just Phase 1 and we will continue to invest in training hours for subsequent phases of the program to make sure we are driving the interactions and outcomes, we believe are the best for our customers and our business. As I mentioned earlier, we are working hard to balance our response to current industry conditions with our need to invest in our future. It has long been part of our cultural DNA to drive cost efficiencies and expense reductions in order to offset pressures and fund investments and this year is no different. In fiscal '24, we are driving benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas, including reverse supply chain, large product fulfillment, and our omnichannel operations. This includes leveraging technology and rapidly evolving AI. For example, in customer care, our virtual agents are now answering 40% of customer questions via chat without a human agent and with high satisfaction levels. We are continuing to add capabilities and are creating additional employee and customer-facing virtual agents that will simplify our most complex interactions like technology support services, while also delivering key insights from our customer care centers back into the enterprise. We are also testing new state-of-the-art routing capabilities to optimize our in-home operations, reducing cost-of-service and improving the availability and wait time of delivery and installation appointments for our customers. As we think about our growth strategies, we believe we can leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental profitable revenue streams. In this vein, we are exploring Geek Squad as a service opportunities with several large companies, including Accenture, Intel, and Lenovo as we have created differentiated B2C and B2B services capability. Device lifecycle management is a specific example of the service we can provide to others and necessity for all companies, device lifecycle management refers to the process of providing tech devices like phones and laptops to employees. This is not a core competency for most companies and the recent hybridization of work has made it even more complicated. We are already supporting a number of firms as their sole device lifecycle management partner providing end-to-end support of these company-provided devices, including procurement, provisioning, deployment, repair, and end-of-life. This is just one example of our ability to leverage our data and assets and adds to the growth we're already seeing in areas like Best Buy Ads and Partner Plus. Before my closing remarks, I also want to take a moment to recognize our Geek Squad teams for their work with our communities. For more than 15 years, they have been sharing and teaching their tech expertise and skills to prepare the next generation for the future workforce. This summer, we welcomed more than 2,000 kids and teens at nearly 40 Geek Squad Academy camps across the country. These camps give participants the opportunity to learn skills on everything from coding, game design, digital music, and more. More importantly, they help young people build self-confidence, spark creativity, and discover how technology can benefit them in their educational pursuits in future careers. I am incredibly proud of all our Geek Squad agents and volunteers for their work this summer inspiring thousands of young minds through tech. As we enter the second half of the year and look forward to the holiday season, we are both proud pragmatic, and optimistic. Of course, the macro-environment remains uncertain with a number of tailwinds and headwinds soon including the October resumption of student loan payments, all of which results in uneven impacts on consumers. Overarchingly, we believe that the consumer is in a good place. But as we have said, they are making careful choices and trade-offs right for their household. During last conference call, we noted that we were preparing for a number of scenarios within our annual guidance range, and we believed our sales were aligning closer to the midpoint of the annual comparable sales guidance. We knew it would be a challenging year for the industry and we are halfway through the year and narrowing our outlook largely as expected. As Matt will discuss in more detail, we are updating our comparable sales guidance accordingly. We now expect comparable sales to decline in the range of 4.5% to 6%. This compares to our previous range of down 3% to down 6%. At the same time, we are narrowing our profitability ranges effectively raising the midpoint of our previous annual guidance for non-GAAP operating income rate and earnings per share. We continue to expect that this year will be the low point in tech demand after two years of sales declines. Tech is a bigger part of all our lives, both in our homes and in our businesses than ever, and we believe next year the consumer electronics industry should see stabilization and possibly growth driven by the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech bought early in the pandemic and the normalization of tech innovation. Let me say a few words about the fourth quarter specifically. For context, we reported a comparable sales decline of 10% for fiscal '23 and roughly 8% for the first half of this year. We are guiding a Q3 year-over-year comparable sales decline that are similar to or a little better than the 6.2% decline we just reported for Q2. Our full-year guidance implies a wide range for Q4 comparable sales of down 3% to slightly positive. There are a number of factors supporting our belief that our Q4 year-over-year comparable sales will improve and could potentially turn positive. We expect growth in-home theater as we expect to be better-positioned with inventory across all price points and budget spends last year. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in our home theater business. For example, TV sales trends improved in Q2 and units returned to growth. We expect performance in our computing category to improve as we build-on our position of strength in the premium assortment will not exactly linear. We are also starting to see signs of stabilization in this category as Q2 laptop sales trends improved materially and units were flat to last year. We expect to see continued growth in the gaming category as inventory is more readily available and there is a promising slate of new software titles expected to be released in the back half of the year. We are planning for potential growth in the mobile phone category as we expect inventory to be less constrained than last year and expect to drive growth in our unlocked phones business. Our hypothesis regarding the holiday season is that the consumer largely returns to pre-pandemic behavior. By this, we mean that they will be looking for great deals and convenience and traffic will be weighted toward promotional events. We have an excellent team and strong omnichannel assets that thrive in such an environment. In summary, while the macro and industry backdrop continue to drive volatility as we move through the year, we have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments and we will continue to adjust as the macro conditions evolve and we remain incredibly excited about our future opportunities. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years. In addition, we continue to see several macro trends that should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, expansion of broadband access, and of course generative AI where we know our vendor partners are working behind the scenes to create consumer products that optimize this material technology advancement. As the largest CE specialty retailer with one-third of the U.S. computing and television market share, we can commercialize new technology for customers like no one else can. And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for some more details on our second quarter results and our fiscal '24 outlook. Matt Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our second quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.6 billion declined 6.2% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rates of 3.8% declined 30 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were essentially flat to last year and increased approximately 140 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was 110 basis-point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP-diluted earnings per share of $1.22 decreased $0.32 or 21%, with approximately half of the decrease due to a higher effective tax rate. When viewing our performance versus our expectations entering the quarter, our revenue was at the high end of the range we provided. Our non-GAAP operating income exceeded our expectations due to a higher gross profit rate driven by a number of areas including lower cost to serve our membership offerings, higher profit-sharing revenue from our private-label credit card arrangement, and lower supply-chain costs. Next, I will walk through the details on our second-quarter results compared to last year. From an Enterprise comparable sales phasing perspective, June's decline of approximately 5% was our best performing month on a year-over-year basis with May and July both down approximately 7%. As we've started Q3, our estimated comparable sales decline in the first four weeks of August was approximately 6%. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 7.1% to $8.9 million driven by a comparable sales decline of 6.3%. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were appliances, home theater, computing, and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in gaming. From an organic perspective, consistent with the past several quarters, our overall blended average selling price declined in the low-single digits as a percentage versus last year. In our International segment, revenue decreased 8.8% to $693 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 5.4% and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Our Domestic gross profit rate increased 110 basis points to 23.1%, a higher gross profit rate was driven by the following. First, our product margin rates improved versus last year. The better product margin rates included a higher level of vendor-supported promotions, and the benefits from optimization efforts across multiple areas. Second, improvement from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category. And third, an improved gross profit rate from our health initiatives. Domestic non-GAAP SG&A dollars were flat to last year as higher incentive compensation was largely offset by reduced store payroll costs. Moving next to capital expenditures where we still expect to spend approximately $850 million this year. This reflects a reduction of $80 million compared to last year with lower store-related investments being the primary driver of the reduced spend. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $560 million to shareholders through dividends of $402 million and share repurchases of $158 million. We expect to continue share repurchases throughout fiscal '24 with the level of share repurchases being slightly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. As I referenced earlier, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 26.6% was higher than the 16.7% rate last year. The lower effective tax rate last year it was primarily due to the resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Now, I would like to discuss our fiscal '24 outlook. As Corie mentioned, we are lowering the high end of our full-year revenue outlook to our previous midpoint while keeping the low end of our revenue guidance unchanged. At the same time, we are narrowing our non-GAAP LOI rate and EPS ranges in a way that raises the midpoint of our previous annual guidance for those items. Let me provide more details on our guidance and working assumptions starting with revenue. We expect Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.8 billion to $44.5 billion. Enterprise comparable sales decline of 4.5% to 6%. Moving on to our full-year profitability guidance, which is Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.9% to 4.1% and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6.40. Our outlook remains unchanged for a non-GAAP effective income tax of approximately 24.5% and for interest and income to exceed interest expense this year. As a reminder, the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 contains an extra week. We expect this extra week to add approximately $700 million of revenue, which is excluded from our comparable sales and $100 million of SG&A. We still expect it to benefit our full-year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points. Next, I will review our full-year gross profit and SG&A working assumptions. We now expect our full-year gross profit rate to improve by approximately 60 basis points compared to fiscal '23 which compares to our prior outlook of 40 basis points to 70 basis points of expansion. The primary drivers of the rate expansion include the following. First, improvement from our membership offerings, which includes a higher gross profit rate in our services category. Our membership offerings are now expected to provide at least 25 basis points of improvement. Second, higher product margin rates, which includes the benefits from our optimization efforts across multiple areas, any higher level of vendor-supported promotions. And third, our health initiatives is also expected to improve our gross profit rate. Lastly, we expect the profit-sharing from our private-label credit card to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year. The profit-sharing has provided a slight benefit to our gross profit rate in the first half of the year, which is expected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year. Now, moving to our SG&A expectations. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase approximately 100 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation, as we lapped the very low levels last year. The high-end of our guidance now assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $185 million compared to fiscal '23. We continue to expect store payroll and advertising expenses to be approximately flat to fiscal '23 as a percentage of sales. As it relates specifically to the third quarter, we expect our comparable sales to be slightly better than the negative 6.2% we reported for the second quarter. On the profitability side, we expect our non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 3.4%. This would represent a decline of approximately 50 basis points versus last year with the contributions from SG&A and gross profit, pretty similar to what we saw in the second quarter. Lastly, I'll share some color on what our guidance implies for the fourth quarter. As Corie discussed, we are planning for multiple revenue scenarios that range from a comparable sales decline of approximately 3% to slightly positive. Our Q4 gross profit rate is expected to improve versus last year, but not at the same level as we are expecting for the full year. SG&A as a percentage of sales is expected to be more favorable than our full-year outlook, which is primarily due to the extra week and the more favorable revenue outlook. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from Truist. Your line is open. Scot Ciccarelli : Scot Ciccarelli. Good morning, guys. Corie, you mentioned some of the newer technology kind of waiting in the wings with AI and stuff. Can you give the group, any kind of flavor for some of the technologies like generically that you guys are thinking about that could potentially drive improvement in sales trends? Corie Barry : Yes, maybe in this, we were talking about computing specifically, and maybe I'll give just a little bit more color there. I mean I think what we're seeing broadly is that computing innovations and the refresh cycles are getting shorter and they are accelerating and we continue to see people using all of their devices more often and far more like a computing processing intensive. And these are really specific activities and you can see both whether you're using it at home, and you're seeing a lot more streaming, or whether using it at work and you're starting to want to leverage some of these more advanced technologies. Obviously, like, for example, Microsoft pre-pandemic focused on dual screen and that was kind of something we had talked about for a while, but they quickly pivoted some of their developments within their Windows OS to address consumer productivity where all of us, we're kind of struggling to make sure we're as productive as possible on multiple devices, a lot of that enhancement went into productivity and I think the emergence of AI is at the heart of many of these innovations. I think in this case, in this example, it centers around the Windows copilot on Windows 11, which brings ChatGPT and AI innovations in the cloud applications within that Windows Office Suite within PowerPoint, Outlook, Excel. And I think what we're expecting will happen and I alluded to it on the call is obviously you're going to have likely at some points here different generation of technology that's going to have more intensively leverage the capabilities that are necessary to run these AI models. I think that's one example. We talk about this often, Scot. It's hard for us always to know exactly what that new horizon of technology is going to be, but this is one that probably has some of the broadest implications for all of our collective productivity. Scot Ciccarelli : Yes, understood. And then thank you for that. And then the second question is the expectation for slight improvement in comp despite a little bit more difficult comparison. Is that really driven by you have more events in the third quarter than the second quarter as we revert to pre-pandemic kind of behavior? Matt Bilunas : No, I think for Q4 specifically, I think as we think about improvement of trends for Q3 and then in Q4, I think we are obviously encouraged by a little bit by back to school. Back to school has been slightly better than we expected as we get into Q3. When you think about Q3 compared to FY '20, it actually has slightly higher growth than what we saw in -- expecting slightly higher growth in Q3 compared to Q2. Q3 compared to '20 has a little bit more holiday sales pulled in. So we are expecting that to continue compared to where pre-pandemic was, but maybe not to the same extent of pull-forward that we've seen in the last few years, so I think we're encouraged by the trends as we leave Q2 if you think about what happened in Q2, we actually saw some stabilization in our business, we saw actually laptop units turned to flat in Q2 in terms of that business and TV units were flat, and so I think there is optimism around how -- what we might expect for the back-half and more specifically Q4 but Q3 we're likely still seeing similar levels to what we saw in Q2. Scot Ciccarelli : Got it. Thanks, guys. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Greg Melich : Thanks. I wanted to start on the top-line, that sort of improvement in trends and I love an update on what credit as the penetration and also you mentioned that that was a tailwind, becoming a headwind. Could you frame that a little bit more as to what percentage of gross profit it is or something like that? Matt Bilunas : Yes. I think for the -- on the credit side specifically, first, we've talked about the credit card portfolio is 1.4 of our domestic sales. 1.4%, so it's pretty similar to what we had said last time. I think overall what we've been seeing for the last number of years is a tailwind for the credit card portfolio of profit share. It certainly -- it came in a little better than we expected in Q2. We are seeing net credit losses normalize to where they were pre-pandemic. I think the thing we're watching for which is based on the state of consumer do this net credit-losses actually turned to higher than they used to be, which would create pressure on the profit share. And in the back half of this year, we are expecting it to be a slight pressure compared to the first part of the year being a benefit for us, but neutral for the year. So it's really that net credit losses is one aspect we're watching, especially as we get into next year. And we think about what the state of the consumer does look like as we get into next year and increasing levels of debt. So still an amazing book and partnership for us in terms of what it does for our consumers and offering a great way to pay for product. It actually also has a very loyal consumer. So we're really happy with the party, just the reality of what we've been trying to normalize a bit, if you will, from the last few years. I think to the improving trends, I think Q3 we're expecting to be a pretty similar, maybe slightly better comp than we saw in Q2. Like I said earlier, back to school is a little better than we expected, but it's running a little longer and little later into the season. And then as you look to Q4, while we are expecting the year-over-year comps improved to at the bottom of the range of minus 3 or the top slightly positive and it still does represent the fact that against FY '20, anywhere from down 7% to down 3% on the high end. So, yes, we believe the year-over-year trend should improve based on a number of the things that Corie mentioned, it still does represent a more stabilization of our consumers. As you look into the back half, the way to think about a more normalized volume that we had pre-pandemic. Greg Melich : Got it. And then my follow-up is on SG&A specifically. I know you expect it delever for the year. You mentioned the incentive comp up $185 million, was that for the full year or in the back half? Matt Bilunas : That would be for the full year. Yes, that's for the full year. Greg Melich : And that's more back-half weighted, presumably? Matt Bilunas : It's pretty even throughout the year. Greg Melich : Okay. And then in terms of leveraging payroll that 100 bps was in the second quarter, was there something about the second quarter that gave you an unusual amounts of hourly payroll leverage, or should we expect that going forward? Matt Bilunas : No, I think for the year, we expect store payroll to be relatively flat on a percentage of sales basis for the whole year. It has been pretty consistent across, but has been pretty consistent across the quarters, and we would expect it to be pretty consistent in the back half of the year as well. Corie Barry : And, Greg, just to make sure we're clear that 100 basis points as versus FY '20. So that's more than like structural change that we've seen over the last four-ish years. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Appreciate that. Well, good luck, everyone. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Seth Sigman from Barclays. Your line is open. Seth Sigman : Hi, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up on that credit point. So neutral for the year, negative in the second half of the year slightly. Can you just size up for us what normal means if that continues into next year? I think your disclosure is that, it's up 50 basis points or so since fiscal 2020, so does normal mean that fully reversed is how do we think about that? Matt Bilunas : Yes. I think my reference to normal. Thanks for the question is more related to net credit losses as a percentage to the book. So we haven't given that number. I won't give it today, but what we're seeing now is a more normal rate compared to FY '20. What we're watching for is it does that rate increase compared to where it used to be and certainly it's already higher than it has been the last few years when the net credit losses were very low rate. And that is just more to do with just the state of the consumer. So right now we still see a relatively good consumer to the extent that they are still continuing to make tradeoff decisions weighing a little bit more pressure on their personal finances that could less to go up into next year. That's the consideration. We will certainly, as we think about next year, we're not guiding next year, but we're thinking about next year, that could be one of the pressures we face as we think about ROI rate just in terms of where does the net credit losses go. Seth Sigman : Okay, thank you for that. Just any other perspective on credit availability today if that's impacting demand in any way? And maybe just put that in context of some of the trends that you may be seeing across consumer cohorts or markets, obviously, you talked about some of the bright spots you've seen in recent months here and what you're expecting for the rest of the year. I'm just trying to think about some of the incremental consumer headwinds ahead whether that is student loans or credit availability? Just any other context around some of the consumer behavior you may be seeing where that's coming from? Corie Barry : Yes, right now as it relates specifically to the card, we aren't seeing massive change in credit availability. We're continuing to see and we've said before, about 25% of our business is done on the card. We're continuing to see those trends. And what are the nice things about our card is as I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but I want to emphasize that you can either choose points or you can choose 0% financing and so it's actually it's an offering that is widely accepted and appreciated, especially against the backdrop so the consumer can decide what's more relevant for them. So like Matt said, we're seeing more of a normalization in some of those key metrics. But in general, it remains an incredibly efficient asset for us in partnership, obviously in the profit share structure that we have. Seth Sigman : Great. Thanks, guys. Corie Barry : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Liz Suzuki from Bank of America. Your line is open. Liz Suzuki : Great, thank you. Just a question on appliances, which looked like they were particularly weak this quarter and some other big-box retailers that sell appliances have talked about an increase in vendor-funded incentives and promotions. Have you seen the same behavior from your vendor partners as they try to respond to slower demand and did vendor funding funded promotions have an impact on margins this quarter? Matt Bilunas : Yes, broadly speaking, we are seeing an increase in vendor-funded promotions across all of our categories and I think appliances would be part of that. I think as we noted in our gross profit rate improvement in Q2, a lot of that was coming from our product margin rates being better year-over-year. Part of that, we're seeing an uptick in the vendor-supported promotions that we are running. So yes, it is a more promotional environment year-over-year and in some cases, certainly more than it was in FY '20, but it hasn't manifested in lower product margins for us. We are seeing both not just us, our vendors wanting to engage in promotional activity to drive and stimulate demand. Liz Suzuki : Great, thank you. And just on the flip side of some of the categories that were particularly strong. Can you just go into a little more detail on what was successful and like the entertainment and services categories and where you see that going in the next couple of quarters? Corie Barry : Well, on the entertainment side of things, that really is reflective of gaming and particularly gaming hardware, which had a much more stable supply this year than what we saw last year, so, we feel like that's a nice indicator as we're heading into the back half of the year. We mentioned that. And on the services side, that really is mainly reflective of our membership offering and now starting to kind of annualize that higher, larger cohorts of members. Liz Suzuki : Great, thank you. Corie Barry : Thank you. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser : Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. Matt, you alluded to operating margin pressure in the next fiscal year. So on a similar level of revenue for Best Buy, call it 2024 versus where it was in 2019, what would be the company's operating margin rate in light of the pressure that it's experienced from investments in health care and some of the impact of the rise in e-commerce penetration for the business and all the actions that the company has taken to try and preserve the profitability in light of those pressures? And what levers can be pulled from here in order to improve the operating margin rate over time, especially as things like credit income continue to decline? Matt Bilunas : Yes, thanks for the question, Michael. What I just to clarify when I was referring to specifically was potential pressure on the credit card profit share as we look into next year, but I wasn't trying to characterize was like overall allied pressure for next year. But to get to your broad question there, I think, as you can appreciate, we're not going to guide next year. But that being said, if for example, our sales were flat next year as some of the indicators would suggest it would be our expectation or our goal to at least hold LOI rate flat if not drive a little bit of expansion. Like I said, there were few factors here. The first being that credit card. It's been a tailwind for us. And like I said, it could turn to some pressure. The second more tactical one is as we enter into next year, we always reset incentive compensation this year. We have a certain amount of that next year, but we reset the one that does sometimes create a little bit of rate pressure, but broadly speaking, if you think about next year and the years outward, a lot of the other drivers are going to be things like the industry -- level of industry growth. So the extent that the industry can grow and does grow, we expect to grow with it. And that does create SG&A leverage as our cost structure today is probably more indicative of a sales number that's higher than what we set. But we've talked about this year being a benefit for us, both the membership and the health initiatives the rate has been improving, so similar to our Investor Day, a while back we would expect those initiatives to continue to improve in terms of rate, as we look forward from here on out. So into next year and in the years after both membership and health will continue to help drive a year-over-year improvement. We also obviously always trying to have a cost takeout initiatives to help mitigate pressures that we face and just help us invest in the right places. But again, like I said, the profit share could become a pressure from an NCL. The other thing to note in terms of the profit share is this potential regulatory changes around late fees. Now, it's too early to know whether those do or don't count, but that's another item to note. And lastly, I don't think I had mentioned this. We're still in a consumer environment where it's a little uneven and steady and so I think as we think about going forward, a lot of it will depend -- the industry growth will depend upon that consumer and where they choose to spend their money, but I think like I said, our goal would be to at least maintain a flat rate, if not grow a little bit, if we have flat sales, for example. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much. My follow-up question is, there is an interesting dynamic that you're referring to on your call, which is the promotional environment in some cases is higher or more intense than it was in 2019, but you're getting more vendor funding than you were getting at least relative to last year. So A, how much is your vendor funding up or down relative to 2019, and B, what does this overall promotional environment suggest about the profit pool for selling consumer electronics in the United States in Best Buy's share of that overall profit pool? Thank you very much. Corie Barry : So, question one, overall vendor trading up for now. We're not going to say total amounts of vendor funding, but you can imagine, at any given point in time our vendors like us are trying to think in a very omnichannel way how best can we both stimulate demand and complete excellent customer experiences. When we kind of like look all in at everything our vendors do with us, we feel confident that we have at least as much if not more like total funding in partnership with our vendors, but of course they're going to use different pockets depending on the environment that we fit in. I think on your profit pool question, Michael, what's interesting is our vendors and we've said this for a long time. Our vendors are as interested as we are in stimulating consumer demand. Sometimes that means they lean highly into innovation and trying to drive replacement cycles and trying to drive that incremental demand through innovation. Sometimes that means we partner closely together in how we show up in stores, whether that's physically or in labor, and then sometimes that means, we will partner together in highly promotional or value-oriented periods to make sure, collectively, we are putting our best foot forward and it goes back to some of what I ended my comments with. There is a larger installed base of consumer electronics out there. And this is not static equipment we all have. This is equipment that whether or not you want to upgrade it, sometimes just wears out and breaks. And this is our unique place in this consumer electronics industry. In partnership with our vendors, we are arguably the best to commercializing that new technology or bringing kind of this total story agnostic just carrying about the customer to life and I think what you're seeing is this in this period right now, our ability to help drive value in partnership with our customers is really highlighted. Michael Lasser : Thank you very much, and good luck. Corie Barry : Thank you. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kate McShane : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. We wanted to ask a little bit more about the membership strategy, which is now in three tiers. Can you talk about how the profitability differs when compared to your previous program of Total Tech Support and does this profitability improve as the program scales and ramps? Matt Bilunas : Sure. Yes, I think the changes we've made to the membership program have had a positive impact on our OI rate this year. I think we've talked about it being at least 25 basis points for the year. It's coming from a few different areas. The first area, I would say is the changes we've made to the My Best Buy program, the free membership where we move points away from that program, which is solely on the credit card that helps drive some improvement in rate. The cumulative growth in the members is also a place where that actually helps improve our margin rates as well. So the growth in the annual membership fees does drive some of the improvement as well. Lastly, the changes we've made to the Total Tech program and turned into my Best Buy Total, it does lower the cost to fulfill and helps to drive an improved gross margin rate as well. So those are the collection that drive the at least 25 basis points. And then Corie can speak to any sort of strategic things around the membership team. Corie Barry : I think what's most important is that at any given point in time, what the team I would argue has done a magnificent job doing is balancing acquisition, retention, and engagement. And while to Matt's point, cost to serve as part of our considerations. What we want are not just to acquire a bunch of members but to make sure they are incredibly engaged and to make sure we retain them over time. And so while the profitability impact is part of what we're looking at, the bigger question we are actually looking at is, what is that combination of acquisition, retention, and engagement that drives what we talked about, which is more sticky customers that bring a larger share of wallet and help keep Best Buy relevant over time. Kate McShane : Thank you. And then a follow-up question was just around market share. We wondered if you've been seeing any kind of meaningful change here, whether it would be sequentially or just in any specific categories? Corie Barry : So the good news is, overall, we feel very strongly about our position in the industry and we talked about it already a bit. We are confident in our relationship with our vendors and grateful for their partnership and I think we continue to be excited to keep investing in our strategy from a position of strength. We've said before, there is not a great single source for market share, both because we have a large portfolio of services. Also because we are always evolving new categories, but from what we can see in some of the more established categories, we have at least held our share in Q2 and we believe that's been true really the first half of the year. So no major trajectory change. We feel like we're positioned well and obviously, the team will continue to work with our vendor partners and ensure that we have that great valuable assortment for our customers. Kate McShane : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brad Thomas from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brad Thomas : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about kind of inflation, deflation. And what you've been seeing of late, and how you're thinking about that in the back half of the year, particularly given the inflationary world that we've all been living in, but this backdrop of consumer electronics that has historically have been deflationary? Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Sure. I think broadly speaking, let's start with the categories. I think what we said from a product perspective, we certainly have seen a little bit inflation over the years. But what we're now seeing actually is more promotionality on a year-over-year basis in some cases compared to FY '20, so from category product perspective, I think we're kind of beyond past the inflation aspects that there isn't some cost of good increase, but generally speaking, the prices have gone up. So I think that hasn't changed too much outside like sometimes more promotionality is dropping that price on a year-over-year basis. I think for inflation in other areas in terms of cost, there are things that are historically have always had a little inflation there, probably it will continue to go up. Wages is an area where we always expect to have a little inflation, marketing also is a place where you see some pretty consistent inflation over the years. Supply chain is the more notable one that I think we're seeing a lot of inflation over the years and now it's starting to subside a little bit. Supply-chain has a number of different areas, one of them being the ocean side of supply-chain. That's the smallest cost that we have and that's an area where inflation actually has come down. Ground transportation or domestic transportation actually is an area where we are still seeing a higher level of inflation based on the wages that have the wage pressures and just the volume that's increased. The warehousing side of supply-chain is also an area where we've seen inflation and would probably expect to continue to see some. We also have wage inflation on the warehousing side, but also just we've expanded our footprint because our large products have grown in terms of the mix of our categories that we did it to add space. So broadly speaking, there are some areas where we probably continue to see inflation and some areas that will abate a little bit as you get into next year and years out. Corie Barry : Brad, explicitly I want to highlight. We started talking about this category becoming promotional again in the fall of 2021. And so this is a category very different than some of what you're hearing and I'll just use an example like a number, where you're starting to see that pullback. That is not the case here, but structurally, we have seen ASPs increase. So to your point about this is generally seen as a deflationary category. We spent some time talking on the last call about the fact that actually over time, it is not necessarily deflationary because every single new Rev of products carries with it a new and different price tag. So actually, over the longer period, when we look back to FY '20, we have seen structural increases in ASP, but that is due more to our premium mix and it's do more to having got more high ASP products like appliances and home theater. And so, I just want to make sure I'm explicit in saying this is a bit of a different category on the pricing side of things. Matt did an exceptional job on some of the costing side of things, but we're in a different place than many other industries and categories. Brad Thomas : That's really helpful. Thanks. Thank you both. And if I could squeeze in one follow-up here around the topic of shrink. Corie, you mentioned some of the new displays you have that have been helpful. But can you just help to put into context the success that you're seeing in this tough environment given that there are so many retailers calling out challenges on shrink right now? Corie Barry : Yes. I will start with our number one priority is and always has been the safety of our customers and our employees. And I need to be clear that in certain parts of the country in certain stores do that attempt that whether it's breaking in or whether it's larger-scale just grabbing and running out that those are real and we are definitely seeing an increase. However, we did not call-out material impacts to the business as a result of shrink pressure. And as we think about the way we think about shrink is overarching everything we call shrink as a percent of revenue, right, because you're kind of trying to gauge it versus the volume and in total, our shrink as a percent of our revenue is within 10 basis-points of pre pandemic fiscal '20 now, I give our teams all the credit in the world around us, and one of the things that's a little bit different here at Best Buy is given the high-ticket nature of what we sell, we've been addressing shrink aggressively for honestly many-many years. It's really embedded in the culture and think about some of the things that are different for us, we have front door asset protection in our stores and likely often more floor coverage as well because we just have more employees in our stores and they just do an exceptional job of washing out over our stores, we usually just have one entrants in our stores, we tend to have less self-checkout. We have a very-high digital penetration at 33%, so that's a little bit different. We also have to spend a lot of time on online side, which is a different kind of definition upstream. And so we just have structurally. I think a little bit different and honestly have been investing really heavily in this space over-time. I'm trying to really hard in our buildings, protect our employees and assets. And then as I mentioned, now going into the next realm of technology solutions that are trying to protect the customer experience and make it still seamless for the customer to get everything they want, and at the same time, create the safest possible environment. Brad Thomas : Very helpful. Thank you, Corie. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Brian Nagel : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Corie Barry : Good morning. Brian Nagel : My first question. I think it's a bit of a follow-up to Keith's question just with respect to memberships. So Corie, you spent a lot of time on the call today. Just talking about the ongoing enhancements of membership and you've given some of the nearer-term financial targets, but I guess the question I want to ask is, as we step-back and clearly the big focus for Best Buy. In your minds, what do we play what I don't want to say necessarily say dream the dream, but intermediate longer-term opportunity with membership either providing a financial standpoint more quantifiable or just from an overall consumer engagement standpoint. Corie Barry : Yes. I'm going to talk from a consumer engagement lens. The thesis of membership has been consistent since the beginning is to drive customer engagement and increase share of wallet in consumer electronics, that is the end game that we're trying to accomplish, all the more important in an environment where we have plenty of data that says consumers are a little less brand loyal than they've ever been, and so it becomes even more important for us to both create and then maintain this deep relationship with our customers. What we've learned across and I said it before, but ahead again across acquisition, retention, and engagement, what we've learned is different customers value and different cohorts of customers value different qualities in our membership program. And so that's why the tiers of Free, Plus and Total they will appeal to either in the free case, someone who just really wants the convenience of free shipping on everything. On the Total - or on the Plus aspect, excuse me, that's someone who loves convenience and a great value, right, they're going to get the promotions. They're going to get early access and we get 60-day return windows. And then on the total. I want all of that plus. I really value the support aspect of what we deal and the most important output of all of those at the end-of-the-day is that we can see customers who both stay engaged with us and we can see that repeat business, and we can see that increase in share of wallet meeting every time they think about making a purchase in consumer electronics, they just come to us because it's so easy why do you go anywhere else. So that structurally, is what you're trying to build to. Over time, you both want the program itself to be efficient, you wanted to be a reasonable cost of acquisition, but over time, you also want a customer who is shopping with more frequency and ultimately spending more with Best Buy. Brian Nagel : No, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up question different topic. We talked about the sale, the expected sales trajectory through the balance of the fiscal year with the expectation that sales will continue to solidify improved maybe work towards that flatline. But you also did call out. I think it was in the prepared comments. The risk of it - if you will is the challenge of this resumption of student loan payments. So, it's obvious topic is starting to get air time. The question. I have is I mean, to what extent you look closely at this. How are you sizing and if you are sizing that potential risk to your sales trajectory here in the near-term. Matt Bilunas : Yes, thank you. I think it's clearly something we're trying to assess and what we effectively believe we've tried to size that in our guide for the back-half of the year. So it's clearly there are a number of different factors influencing the consumer right now shift to spend the services, their increasing use of credit card, but they're still spending money. So I think it's certainly an impact for us. I think if you look at our demographics, we potentially could be more slightly exposed, but at the same time, we have a demographic that actually has a higher income, who can more afford, increase in the number of student debt payments. So it's something we certainly tried to factor into the back-half for sure, but it's not the only factor that's happening. Corie Barry : You bet. Thank you, Brian. We appreciate the questions and overarchingly thank you to everyone who took the time to be with us today. And before we close the call. I want to make sure we acknowledge the wildfires in Maui, but also the wildfires, we've seen in Canada. And those bracing for a hurricane in Florida. Our hearts genuinely go out to those impacted and we are doing all we can to support our employees in all of those impacted areas. Thank you so much for joining us today. Operator : That concludes today's Best Buy's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you all for joining, and I hope everyone has a great day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available for -- by approximately 1 :00 P.M Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice-President of Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO, and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and an explanation of why these financial measures are useful can be found in this morning's earnings release, which is available on our website, investors.bestbuy.com.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. For the third quarter, we are reporting better-than-expected profitability on slightly softer-than-expected revenue. Specifically, we are reporting a comparable sales decline of 6.9%, which is slightly below our outlook for the quarter as consumer demand softened through the quarter. At the same time, we expanded our Q3 gross profit rate 90 basis points from last year due to profitability improvements in our membership program and better product margins. We also lowered our SG&A expense compared to last year as we tightly controlled expenses and adjusted our labor expense rate with sales fluctuations. During the quarter, we grew our paid membership base and drove meaningful improvements in customer satisfaction scores across many of our service offerings, including in-home delivery, in-store services and remote support. Our Q3 results demonstrate our ongoing strong operational execution as we navigate through the sales pressure our industry has been experiencing for the past several quarters. The sales pressure is due to many factors, including the pandemic pull-forward of tech purchases, the shift back into services outside the home like travel and entertainment and inflation. In the more recent macro-environment, consumer demand has been even more uneven and difficult to predict. Based on the sales trends in Q3 and so far in November, we believe it is prudent to lower our revenue outlook for Q4. But despite the lowered sales outlook, the midpoint of our annual EPS guidance is now slightly higher than the midpoint of our original guidance as we entered the year. I want to thank our associates for their resilience and relentless focus on our customers. I continue to be so very proud of the way our teams are managing the business today and preparing for our future. Now, I would like to provide more color on our Q3 performance and holiday plans before passing the call off to Matt for the financial details on the quarter and our outlook. We continue to strategically manage our promotional plan and we're price-competitive in an environment, where consumers are very deal-focused and making spend tradeoffs right for their budget. Consumers are looking for value, and from an industry themes' perspective, we are seeing some trade-down in the television category, but not as much trade-down in other categories. As a result, and as expected, the goal of industry promotions and discounts were above last year and pre-pandemic fiscal '20. Similar to the first half of the year, during Q3, our purchasing customers were relatively consistent in terms of demographics versus last year. As a reminder, we over-index with higher-income consumers, compared to the general population. And we saw the percent of revenue categorized as premium and the percent of purchases over $1,000 remain constant versus last year. We have largely maintained our year-to-date industry share in our Circana, formerly NPD-tracked categories. Against this backdrop, our focus on deepening relationships with customers remains crucial. Our membership program delivered another quarter of growth and improved profitability versus last year. The Q3 contribution to the enterprise operating income rate was larger-than-expected due to the combination of a lower cost to serve and higher paid in-home installation services. For the full year of fiscal '24, we now expect our three-tiered membership program to contribute approximately 35 basis points of Enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion. It is still early since we introduced material changes in June, but there are a number of insights I would like to share. One, we continue to increase our paid membership base and now have 6.6 million members. This compares to 5.8 million at the start of the year. During the third quarter, we signed up approximately 35% more new paid members compared to the third quarter of last year, driven by the addition of the new Tier and buoyed by back-to-school and October\u2019s member month events. Two, our paid members continue to interact with the brand and shop more frequently compared to non-members, which is the goal of any membership program. Three, and though it is early and we have not yet lapped the new programs, retention rates are outperforming expectations. Four, My Best Buy Total, which is the evolution of our prior Total tech offer, continues to resonate more strongly in our physical store setting. As a reminder, this tier is $179.99 per year and includes Geek Squad 24/7 tech support via in-store, remote, phone or chat on all your electronics no matter where you purchase them. It also includes up to two years of product protection, including AppleCare Plus on most new Best Buy purchases and includes all the benefits of My Best Buy Plus. And five, our My Best Buy Plus tier is resonating more with the digital customers and appeals to a broader set of customer segments. This is the new tier for customers who want value and access. For $49.99 per year, customers get exclusive prices and access to highly anticipated product releases. They also get free two-day shipping and an extended 60-day return and exchange window on most products. We are still early in the process and are testing different promotional offers to determine what resonates most with consumers as well as continuously improving the digital experience to make it even easier to find deals and benefits. Of course, we also have a free membership tier that enables free shipping for everyone, a great differentiator, especially in the holiday season. During the quarter, we continued to evolve our omnichannel capabilities to support our strategy and make it easy and enjoyable for consumers to get the best tech and premier expert consultation and service when they want it through our online store and in-home experiences. Last month, we introduced Best Buy Drops, which is a new experience only available through the Best Buy app. It gives customers the opportunity to access product releases, limited edition items, launches and deals from a variety of categories. There are multiple drops nearly every week, and they're only available in limited quantities. We are encouraged by the early results as Best Buy Drops is driving both incremental customer app downloads and higher frequency of app visits. We have also seen growth in sales from customers who are getting help from our virtual sales associates. These interactions, which can be via phone, chat or our virtual store, drive much higher conversion rates and average order values than our general dot.com levels. This quarter, we had 140,000 customer interactions by a video chat with associates, specifically out of our virtual store locations. As a reminder, this is a physical store in one of our distribution centers with merchandising and products that are staffed with dedicated associates and no physical customers. We also teamed up with live shopping platform Talk Shop Live, to test a series of online shopping events this month, starring our virtual sales associates. These events feature products from some of our newer categories like beauty and wellness as well as new tech and unique products. Our physical store portfolio is one of our key assets, and the role of our stores is to provide customers with differentiated experiences, services and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need some stores to be more cost and capital efficient to operate. As a reminder, while almost one-third of our domestic sales are online, 43% of those sales were picked up in one of our stores by customers in Q3. And most customers shop us in multiple channels. Consistent with our normal cadence, we have largely completed the changes to our store portfolio for the year, so we can focus on the holiday season with minimal disruption to our physical stores. As we think about next year with the current economic backdrop, we plan to spend more of our capital expenditures refreshing a greater number of our stores and less on large-scale remodels. As such, we have three priorities for our US store fleet in the near term. Number one, we are refreshing our stores with a particular focus on improving enlivening the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the shopping floor. For example, this year, in all our stores, we installed new premium end caps in partnership with key vendors that improve the merchandising in the center of the store. This year, we installed up to 10 of these new end caps per store or roughly one-third of our end caps per store and plan to add more next year as we work to upgrade these crucial locations in our stores. In addition, this year, we rightsized our traditional gaming spaces in roughly half of our stores to allow for the expansion of growing categories like PC gaming and newer offerings such as Greenworks cordless power tools, wellness products like the Oura ring, Epson short throw projectors, e-bikes and scooters and Lovesac home furnishing products. While small, we are seeing promising results in some of these new categories with meaningful market share growth. And as always, we continue to work closely with our vendor partners to add experiences to our stores. For example, LEGO and Therabody invested in new shop-in-shops in all our 35,000 square foot experience stores. In addition, and as you would expect, many of our premium partners are continuously updating their in-store spaces to reflect their latest innovations. We will continue this work next year in all our stores, rightsizing a number of categories to ensure we are leveraging the space in the center of our stores in the most exciting, relevant and efficient way possible. Our second priority is to keep investing in formats we know drive returns. This year, we implemented 8 large format 35,000 square foot experienced store remodels for a total of 54 and will end the year with 23 outlet stores. At this point in time, we plan to implement a minimal number of remodels and outlets next year. And the third priority is to open a few smaller footprint stores to keep testing our hypothesis at physical points of presence matter, and we need less selling square footage and more fulfillment and inventory holding space. In addition, we plan to open a few smaller stores in outstate markets to test the impact of adding new locations and geographies where we have no prior physical presence and our omnichannel sales penetration is low. At the same time, we also continue to close existing traditional stores as a result of our rigorous review of stores as their leases come up for renewal. This year, we have closed 24 stores. Over the past five years, we have closed approximately 100 Best Buy stores, which is a 10% decline in store count during that time frame. And we expect to close roughly 15 to 20 stores per year in the near term. We have been enhancing our supply chain network to support these footprint changes and deliver speed, predictability and choice to our customers. For example, we have worked to optimize our ship-from-store hub footprint to maintain substantial coverage for faster offers and take shipping volume pressure off the majority of the stores to allow them to focus on in-store and pickup experiences. Additionally, we are optimizing our shipping locations to enhance our efficiency and effectiveness while still delivering with speed. And as a result, in Q3, we had the lowest ship from store volume as a percent of total since well before the pandemic, with approximately 62% of e-commerce small packages delivered to customers from automated distribution centers. We also continued to augment our own supply chain through other partners and launched Best Buy on DoorDash marketplace, offering our second scheduled parcel delivery option in addition to Instacart Marketplace. As we have discussed previously, we have made strategic structural changes to our store operating model over the past few years to adjust to the shifts we have seen in customer shopping behavior and our corresponding operational needs. These changes provide more flexibility and have allowed us to flex labor hours with the fluctuations in customer sales, shopping preferences like curbside and traffic. As a result, we kept our labor rates steady as a percent of revenue, even as our sales have declined over the past several quarters. As you can imagine, there is a delicate balance to maintain while we adjust our store operating model as the expert service our associates provide customers is a core competitive advantage. We keep a very close watch on our customer satisfaction trends to make sure we are not negatively impacting the customer experience. Broadly, I am proud that the team is doing this work while driving higher purchasing customer NPS for associate availability, product availability and pricing. We are also committed, of course, to providing a great employee experience through training opportunities and benefits. As we mentioned last quarter, we have now led thousands of our sales associates through a certification process focused on our foundational retail excellence. We are also leveraging technology in our stores more than ever to continue to elevate our customer and employee experiences in more cost-effective ways. A great example is our app built for employees called Solution Sidekick, that provides a guided selling experience consistent across departments, channels and locations. Our employees have embraced solution Sidekick and we can see higher customer NPS when our employees are utilizing the app in their interactions with customers. We are gratified that our employee retention rates continue to outperform the retail industry, particularly in key leadership roles, the vast majority of which we hire internally. Our average tenure, excluding our seasonal workforce, for field employees is just under five years, and our general manager tenure is almost 16 years. This is crucial as we can directly tie tenured experience and training certifications to NPS improvement over time. We have also seen a strong pool of applicants for new associates to supplement our store teams this holiday season. As you all have likely noticed, the holiday shopping season has begun. Since we are preparing for a customer who is very deal focused, we expect shopping patterns will look even more similar to historical holiday periods than they did last year with customer shopping activity concentrated on Black Friday week, Cyber Monday and the last two weeks of December. From an inventory perspective, we expect to have strong product availability across categories this year. We will continue to manage inventory strategically to maximize our ability to flex with customer demand. We are excited about the promotions and deals we have planned for all customers and budgets, including special promotions and early access to deals for our My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total members. We have curated gift list to help everyone find the perfect gift. We also introduced a new resource on bestbuy.com and the Best Buy app called Yes Best Buy Sells That, where customers can find the latest in tech and gifting, like pet tech, baby tech or electric vehicle chargers, all the way to unique products, some shoppers may not know we sell like skin treatments, toys for all ages and electric outdoor power equipment. For added ease of shopping and peace of mind, we've extended both our store hours and our product return policy for the holiday season. And this year, for the first time, we also extended that our shoppers can connect directly with one of our virtual sales experts to get help with their holiday shopping. We're also offering free next-day delivery on thousands of items in addition to convenience store and curbside pickup options. Most orders placed on bestbuy.com or through the Best Buy app are ready for store pickup within one hour. Same-day delivery is also available on most products for a small fee. From a merchandising perspective, we're excited for shoppers to see new innovation in a variety of categories, including AI-powered devices like Microsoft CoPilot and Windows 11 computers, the latest in virtual and mixed reality with Meta Quest 3 or Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, immersive audio with Bose Quiet Comfort ultra-headphones and more, and we can help our holiday shoppers take advantage of this new innovation through our trade-in program, which gives the customer value for their old technology. In addition to great deals for our flagship categories like computing, home theater and gaming, that feature our unique ability to showcase higher-end technologies at great value, we also have an expanded assortment of new and growing categories, including e-transportation, health and wellness and outdoor living. Our e-transportation assortment has more options for people of all ages and skill levels. We have twice as many outdoor cooking brands compared to last year and more than 5,000 health and wellness products, including a lineup of fitness, recovery, beauty, skin care, baby tech and more. As you can likely hear, we are very excited to provide customers an amazing experience this holiday season. Of course, the macro environment remains uncertain with some tailwinds and increasingly more headwinds, all contributing uneven impacts on consumers. The job market remains strong and upper income and older demographics, in particular, continue to benefit from excess savings. Overarchingly, the consumer is still spending. But as we have said before, they are making careful choices and trade-offs right for their households. Given the sustained inflationary pressure on the basics, like food, fuel and lodging and the ongoing preference towards services spending, like restaurants, concert tickets indications. Additional indicators have continued to soften, including declining consumer confidence increasing debt and waning savings, and we saw sales trends soften as we move through the quarter. This environment continues to make it challenging to predict shopping behavior even during the most exciting time of the year. While we are lowering our Q4 sales outlook, we have a wide range to allow for a number of scenarios and the mid- to high end of the range reflects sequential improvement. As we discussed on our last call, there are several factors supporting our belief that our Q4 year-over-year comparable sales can improve. We expect home theater year-over-year performance to improve as we expect to be better positioned with inventory across all price points and budgets than last year. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in our TV units as they grew in Q2 and Q3 and are expected to grow in Q4. We expect performance in our computing category to improve as we build on our position of strength in the premium assortment. Notebook units were flat compared to last year in Q2, down as expected in Q3 and expected to be up slightly in Q4 and we expect to see continued growth in the gaming category as inventory is more readily available and there are strong new software titles. In summary, while the macro and industry backdrop continues to drive volatility, we have a proven track record of navigating well through dynamic and challenging environments, and we will continue to adjust as the macro conditions evolve. And we remain incredibly confident about our future opportunities. After two years of declines, we believe the consumer electronics industry should see more stabilization next year and possibly growth in the back half of the year. While our existing product categories have slightly different timing nuances, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years, benefiting from a materially larger installed base and the ongoing desire and need to replace technology as it ages. Much of this replacement is spurred by innovation, and in addition, we continue to see several macro trends that should drive opportunities in our business over time, including cloud, augmented reality, expansion of broadband access and, of course, generative AI, where we know our vendor partners are working behind the scenes to create consumer products that optimize this material technology advancement. Our purpose to enrich lives through technology is more relevant today than ever. We're the largest CE specialty retailer. We continue to hold one-third of the market share in both the US computing and television industries and we can commercialize new technology for customers like no one else. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Matt for more details on our third quarter results our fiscal '24 outlook. Matt Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing details on our third quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $9.8 billion declined 6.9% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.8% declined 10 basis points compared to last year. Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were $57 million lower than last year, and it increased approximately 100 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Partially offsetting the higher SG&A rate was a 90 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 6.5% to $1.29. When viewing our performance compared to our expectations, we did not see the sequential improvement versus the second quarter that our third quarter outlook assumed. From an enterprise comparable sales phasing perspective, August decline of approximately 6% was our best performing month, with September down 7% and October down 8%. Although our sales were below plan, our non-GAAP operating income rate exceeded our outlook by approximately 40 basis points, which was driven by lower SG&A. The lower-than-expected SG&A was largely driven by tighter expense management in areas such as store payroll and advertising expense as we adjusted plans to account for sales trends. Our gross profit rate was essentially flat to our expectations. Lastly, approximately $20 million of vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A while our outlook assumed it would have been a reduction of cost of sales. We anticipate similar recognition of this funding in Q4 in the range of $15 million to $20 million. Next, I will walk through the details of our third quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 8.2% to $9 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 7.3%. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were appliances, computing, home theater and mobile phones, which were partially offset by growth in gaming. From an organic perspective, the overall blended average selling price of our products was essentially flat to last year, which is a slight improvement relative to the past few quarters. In our International segment, revenue decreased 3.4% to $760 million. This decrease was driven by a comparable sales decline of 1.9% and a negative impact of foreign exchange rates. Our Domestic gross profit rate increased 100 basis points to 22.9%. The higher gross profit rate was driven by the following. First, improvement from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category. Second, our product margin rates improved versus last year, including a higher level of vendor-supported promotions and the benefit from optimization efforts across multiple areas. And third, lower supply chain costs. Before moving on, I would like to give some additional context on the profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement, which performed better than we expected in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the profit share has been approximately flat from a dollar perspective over the course of the year, which has resulted in a slightly positive impact to our gross profit rate. In the fourth quarter, we expect the profit share to come in better than we had expected and once again be very similar to last year from a dollar perspective. As we look to next year, we expect the credit card profit share to be a pressure to our gross profit rate. At this point in time, we expect this pressure to be offset by continued financial improvement from our membership offerings. Moving to SG&A. Our Domestic non-GAAP SG&A declined $58 million with the primary drivers being lower store payroll costs and reduced advertising, which were partially offset by higher incentive compensation. Next, let me touch on our inventory balance. Similar to last year at this time, we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. Our quarter-end inventory balance was approximately 4% higher than last year's comparable period. As we noted during last year's third quarter earnings call, approximately $600 million of inventory receipts came in a few days later than we had expected, moving from October into November. Adjusting for that timing shift, this year's ending inventory balance would have been approximately 4% lower than last year's targeted ending balance. Year-to-date, we've returned a total of $873 million to shareholders through dividends of $603 million and share repurchases of $270 million. We now expect share repurchases of approximately $350 million for the year. Let me next share more color on our outlook for the year, starting with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. From a top line perspective, we now expect our fourth quarter comparable sales to be down in the range of 3% to 7%. Our Enterprise comparable sales through the first three weeks of November are near the low end of the fourth quarter range. On the profitability side, we expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income rate to be in the range of 4.7% to 5%, which compares to a rate of 4.8% last year. Our fourth quarter gross profit rate is expected to improve versus last year by approximately 30 basis points. Although favorable to last year, the year-over-year improvement is less than the 90 basis points of expansion we reported for the third quarter. From a sequential standpoint, there are three main items I would highlight that are expected to reduce the rate expansion in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. First, although it is still a benefit compared to last year, the changes to our membership offering are less impactful in the larger holiday quarter. Second, product margin rates are expected to be closer to flat to last year in the fourth quarter compared to a benefit in the third quarter. And third, we expect supply chain cost to be a slight pressure in the fourth quarter versus a benefit in the third quarter. From an SG&A standpoint, when comparing to last year, we expect our fourth quarter SG&A as a percentage of sales to be more favorable than our year-to-date trends, which is due in part to the impact of the extra week this year. The range of SG&A implied in the fourth quarter incorporates our normal course of actions to adjust variable expenses under the different revenue scenarios as well as adjustments to incentive compensation align with our expected financial outcomes. As a reminder, we expect the extra week to add approximately $700 million of revenue, which is excluded from our comparable sales and $100 million in SG&A, we still expect it to benefit our full year non-GAAP operating income rate by approximately 10 basis points. Let me provide more details on our full year guidance, which incorporates the color I just shared on the fourth quarter. We now expect the following. Enterprise revenue in the range of $43.1 billion to $43.7 billion, Enterprise comparable sales to decline 6% to 7.5%, Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 4% to 4.1%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $6 to $6.30, non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 24%, and lastly, our interest income is still expected to exceed interest expense this year. Our full year gross profit and SG&A working assumptions remain very similar to what we shared last quarter. And some of the key callouts are the following. We still expect our gross profit rate to improve by approximately 60 basis points compared to fiscal '23. A large driver of the gross profit rate improvement is expected to come from our membership offerings, which includes a higher gross profit rate in our services category. Our membership offerings are now expected to provide approximately 35 basis points of improvement. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to increase by approximately 95 basis points compared to last year. We expect higher incentive compensation as we lapped up very low levels last year. The high end of our guidance now assumes incentive compensation increases by approximately $140 million compared to fiscal '23. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a question, as we get into the fourth quarter, it looks like we'll have negative comps, and it will be the third year in a row. As you step back, I think there's logic to this massive pull forward and there is a larger installed base. There should be a replacement cycle. But I wanted to kind of question that. And if it throws any water on this, if there's something else happening here, maybe there is a lack of newness. You mentioned that you didn't lose much share, but thinking about market share as well, but thinking about the cycles and whether we're not -- whether we could be in just a negative industry cycle for a little bit longer. Corie Barry : Thanks for the question, Simeon. I think we have a few things going on to your point. So if you think about the comments that I had in the macro section, you've got a variety of stacked issues happening. One is absolutely you had pull forward throughout the pandemic. Two is you also have this kind of sustained inflation. And again, it's sustained inflation on the basics that we've been talking about food, fuel and lodging. And so that's pulling people. We also talked about the fact that a lot of spend right now is geared towards the more service type of things like concerts, like trips. Everywhere you look, people are taking more and more vacations. And so you have all of this kind of shift of spend that's happening. I think secondarily, as it relates specifically to the holiday time frame, the other interesting thing is people have also been buying CE a little bit more steadily throughout the year. If you think about CE as more of a need-based item, not just that kind of giftable item, and so I think there's also just been a little bit of a shift in where people are spending. But I think broadly, what we're seeing reflected right now is the kind of culmination of not just pull forward, but all of these other factors that we're seeing from the consumer as they make those trade-offs. And we've been using the words uneven for probably six quarters now, and I think that is what you're seeing in the variety of results from consumers and where they're choosing to spend their dollars. Simeon Gutman : Maybe the quick follow-up is the Q4, I guess, you're running at the low end. Does it get better because the comparison gets better? Or you're hopeful around how the big holiday sales end up playing out? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. I think the comparison certainly gets better. As you think about last year, we were about 3% lower than FY '20 levels. This year, we're lower against FY '20, but the sequential is better in Q4. I think there's still a lot of optimism for holiday. I think there's a lot of great holiday promotions and events. And I think we're trying to temper any expectation on holiday just with the pragmatic view of where the consumer is at right now. And I think you commented on the share. I think we actually -- we say largely held share because it's really hard to actually get a good meaningful number on share, but we feel good about our share position as we go into the holiday period. Simeon Gutman : Okay. Thanks. Happy Thanksgiving. Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Chris Horvers : Thanks, and good morning. So, thanks for the commentary around the credit card headwind that you're thinking about next year being offset by the membership. Can you talk about implicitly what you're assuming as a headwind in that comment, there's a lot of speculation. There's a lot of numbers getting thrown around in the market. And so I just want to try to understand what you're implicitly assuming? And then in addition, what are the other big puts and takes in gross margin as you think about 2024, as you think about initiative spending as well as your health efforts? Matt Bilunas : Sure. Thanks for the question. For credit card next year, I mean, obviously, there's a number of scenarios we're trying to understand as you think about next year. So we're not really guiding next year now. But when we think about the credit card, that pressure that we expect to see, we believe, will largely be offset by benefits we might see from the membership program and services category expanding a bit more from a gross property perspective. The factors within the credit card, one of the biggest things we're trying to understand is just where do net credit losses go. They're -- at the moment, they're pretty close to where they were pre-pandemic. They were very low levels during the pandemic. And so we've been seeing them grow a little bit. And so the question would be how high did those grow if they do grow into next year and what sort of pressure. The other factor to consider is that, generally speaking, our receivable balance is higher than it used to be over the last several years. And so a higher receivable balance and interest income obviously can offset some of those pressures as well. So those are a couple of the bigger things we're trying to understand as we think about the credit card specifically. And as you mentioned, again, for next year, the other puts and takes, again, we're not guiding next year, but that credit card pressure and the membership benefit is one of the bigger factors we're trying to understand. Another one that I would call out would be -- we know that we're going to likely have to add STI expense back in as we're -- we've lowered the expense this year as we reset STI in the coming year to roughly $85 million that we would likely add back. Clearly, where the industry is a question as well to the extent that sales are flat or up, it helps relieve some of the pressure of some fixed costs. Clearly, the level of pressure matters quite a bit next year. If it's a small increase, small decline, it's less significant than is a bigger decline. So those are some of the bigger factors we're trying to think through as we go into next year. Chris Horvers : So that's a perfect segue. On the SG&A side, Corie, I know you talked about your NPS scores with purchasing customers and what you're seeing in the store, you've caught what feels like a lot of labor over the past few years or past couple of years. Are there any metrics that you're seeing, whether it's non-purchasing customers, like close rates versus people walking indoor that are concerning to you? And then as you think about '24, given that you've comped negatively for this sustained period, is there just less flexibility to manage the labor component? Corie Barry : So I alluded to NPS being one of the factors that we -- you can imagine, there is a broad array of both operational and then more survey-based metrics that we're looking at, everything from how fast can we do an in-store pick, how good is the curbside experience. We specifically talked about and we can see meaningful improvements year-over-year in product availability, in associate availability, in a variety of products and pricing, and those have continuously improved even as this year has gone on. And actually, we can also see some level of improvement in some of those through non-purchasers as well. So we're watching both sides of this and that sequential improvement is happening across both purchasers and non-purchasers. And yes, we're watching close rate too, and the team is doing a really nice job measuring themselves and showing some progress against their close rate expectations as well. So we are -- literally, we have the almost Rubik's cube of operational and customer survey-based metrics so we can assess. I think what the team has done a really amazing job at is your point around flexibility. You talked about do you have less. Interestingly, now we have associates who can opt into and get certified in not just multiple areas of expertise within the store, but they can also get certified for operations roles and sales roles, and they can actually move between stores within their markets. And so we can flex not just against what's the consumer demand at the highest level, we can actually flex within a market depending on how and where people are choosing to shop. So I can even use an example like in the last week, we've seen a lot more people opting into in-store pickup and curbside and needing a bit more ship from store, and we can quickly then shift some of that labor into those areas, while still trying to strike the balance. We also talked about even moving some of the ship from store out of stores using those automated facilities so that when we do have labor in the stores, it's more customer-facing. It's facing more some of these key areas where we're trying to deliver these experiences. So not perfect and certainly not going to be perfect every single day at every single location, but we really are working hard, and I give the team a great deal of credit for every day monitoring both the experiences and the operational metrics that will tell us whether or not we're delivering. Chris Horvers : Got it. Have a great Thanksgiving. Corie Barry : Thanks, you too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Peter Keith of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Peter Keith : Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. Happy holidays. Nice to see the membership program changes coming a bit more accretive than initially guided. Could you help us unpack that a little bit in terms of the drivers, if it's just removing the free installation or maybe that middle tier is trending a little more profitable than you thought. Maybe curious on what the uptick is from? Matt Bilunas : Sure. The main drivers of the improvement from a rate perspective are -- there's basically four main areas. The first is the point change to the three My Best Buy program. The second would be just the growth in paid members over time and the recognition of those annual fees. The changes we made to the total tech program, moving it to Total, mainly came through with lowering the cost to fulfill as we removed the free installation that also was part of the 35 basis points, and the resumption of appliance at home theater installation, paid insulation is the other part of the number. The main drivers of it coming better than our expectations are around higher-than-expected paid installation volumes and then also lower-than-expected Best Buy claims and lower Apple premiums than we had expected. Peter Keith : Okay. That's helpful, Matt. And then -- and Corie, I guess everyone is very curious on product innovation and understanding we're kind of in this air pocket with very little innovation. But I'm curious are there any little green shoots that you're seeing in stores, maybe smaller products that we're not thinking about that give us some optimism that newness can drive sales? Corie Barry : Yeah. I actually -- I mean, I might be biased, but I think there's a lot of green shoots that are out there. And you're right, back to the -- one of the first questions, definitely what has also caused the pullback in CE, and I didn't hit it, to begin with, I'll hit it now, is just a bit of a lack of innovation when everyone was trying so hard to produce as much as possible or pull back as hard as possible, we just haven't seen it. Now we are starting to see a little bit of that turn toward innovation. What we can see, even in TVs, we can see there's a lot more interest in those large screen sizes. We can see growth in the like 77-inch plus kind of categories where people want to get that newness. We actually have double the amount of SKUs in the 97-inch and above TV category, which I know sounds insane, but those are really interesting things to people from a true entertaining at home perspective. In majors, there's a brand-new washer/dryer combo unit from GE, so you can both do the washing and the drying in one unit, which is a really interesting innovation for people like me who might want to do two loads at once, full time and get through it all. In gaming, you can see there's really good availability of consoles, with some really interesting new titles that are driving some demand, some handheld gaming from ASUS and Lenovo. Those are great. And then there's kind of some smaller just interesting things. We talked about the Meta Quest 3, the Meta Ray-Ban sunglasses and not only can you capture pictures but has audio built in. And then I think there's lots of just really small fun giftable things, right? There's everything from the automated bird feeder to the automated litter box and everything in between. So what's cool and the reason a little tongue in cheek, we mentioned the Best Buy sells that is there are actually a ton of really interesting fun consumer technology devices. And to your point, they're kind of small, but they're starting to lead the way into what I think will be more meaningful cycles as we head into the back half of next year. As you think about, we mentioned generative AI and products and importantly, chips that geared toward running those kind of large language processing models. And you can imagine that will extend not just into computing, but into other areas. And we can't always talk about everything that we can see on the horizon, but we definitely can see some interesting products as our vendors, as you all know, are just as incented to stimulate demand as we are. Peter Keith : Very good. Good luck with the holiday season. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Baker of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mike Baker : Okay. Great. Thank you. And this was sort of touched on, but the promotional activity, I think you said it's up. Where is it versus plan? Do you expect it to get more promotional as we get through the holiday season? And you said this year, it will be more traditional, i.e., Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the last few weeks, et cetera. Can you remind us how the holiday played out last year? Matt Bilunas : Sure. I think strategically -- I think we've done a really good job of managing our promotional plan overall. I think the promotions in terms of the discounts and mix of promotions are up versus last year, and in many cases, up compared to where they were pre-pandemic. Again, it hasn't necessarily manifested in our pressure on our product margin rates because we're still receiving a good amount of funding from our vendors to help stimulate the sales that you would expect us to want to do. I think as you look about the holiday season, I think we are expecting the holiday to be a very sales-driven event. Consumers are looking for deals, and they're looking for value. And because of that, we believe it will look probably more closely to like it was pre-pandemic, where people are gravitating towards the big sale events around Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday and a couple of weeks before Christmas. So a pretty similar cadence to what we saw in FY '20, although in FY '20, we did -- didn't have as much pull forward into October as we likely still have in this current year. So a more similar cadence to promotional events. I would expect holiday always to be promotional, and we are well positioned to be promotional and still maintain a great profitable story for our investors. So overall, I think we're in a great spot. Corie Barry : And just to be explicit, what we actually had said, the promo environment was as expected. It was in line with our expectations in Q3. And you can imagine we're kind of taking -- what we're seeing and pushing that into Q4, but it hasn't been wildly outside our expectations. Mike Baker : Got it. Okay. Thank you. If I could ask one more, and maybe you can't answer this, but you did talk a lot about some crowding out in that kind of dynamic with the higher inflation. Well, now all of a sudden, the inflation concern is turning to deflation concern. Asking you to look into your crystal ball, how that could impact your sales results next year if the inflation goes away and we're more in a deflationary environment? Corie Barry : Yeah. I mean we've been pretty consistent as we've talked about the effects of inflation. We've been pretty consistent in saying, where it's putting pressure on the consumer is because it's in those key basic areas of need, fuel, food, lodging, consumables like the stuff you just kind of need every single day. And that's what's been eating into a lot of that pent-up savings, especially for some of the lower income demographics. And so if you start to get into a world where you see more disinflation in some of those areas, then as you would expect, you start to free up some of that share of wallet for potentially getting back into goods or some of the kind of higher ticket purchases. And so we're watching that carefully. Right now, still very elevated versus especially pre-pandemic, slowing down, and to your point, people start to talk about it, which over time, I think, could present some opportunity for people to move back into the goods space, also, of course, depending on how elevated that spend remains around services and things like vacations and spending outside the home. Mike Baker : Yeah. Makes perfect sense. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the color. Corie Barry : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Zaccone of Citi. Your line is open. Steven Zaccone : Great. Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on average selling prices. So it sounds like it was flat, slight improvement. What drove that improvement on a sequential basis by category? And then as you think about the fourth quarter, can you talk about your outlook for units versus ASPs? Matt Bilunas : Yeah. I -- we'll get into the by category improvement to ASPs. Generally speaking, we are starting to, I would say, lap some of the ASP reduction. We've been seeing ASPs slowly get lower, also the last number of quarters. I think we're starting to lap some of that deflation in that average selling price, if you will. So I think it's probably as much as that as people are gravitating to in some cases, we mentioned that TV is an area of trade down that we are actually seeing. And so those do tend to lower your ASPs because it's a big ticket item. And as we start to lap that, I think you're starting to see some relief on the ASP sequentially. Again, I think in certain areas, so in terms of like Q4, clearly, we've been seeing unit pressure overall, but there are some areas where some of our bigger categories we are expecting the units to improve. We're expecting TV units to increase. We're expecting to see improvements in notebook units as well. So it's a little bit varied, but those are some of the bigger ones. Steven Zaccone : Okay. Great. Thanks. And then Corie, I had a question. Just thinking about next year, I think you alluded to more stabilization and the potential for growth in the back half. I guess I was curious, how do you see the recovery playing out? We're waiting for the tech refresh cycle. But if the overall promotional environment stays challenging, how do you think about the recovery from market share position or maybe if the consumer is willing to trade down, how are you positioned to outpace the industry overall? Corie Barry : So if I think about how the last year has played out, this industry has largely been in a very promotional stance for over the last year. We've been pretty consistent in saying promos are back to, if not greater, than FY '20 levels. So this is not a new phenomenon for us. So even as we head into next year, we're lapping that. And even in that environment where you've seen that level of promotionality, as Matt said, we've sustained our share position. So I think the team has done a beautiful job positioning us well in a very promotional environment. And I wouldn't be surprised to see that environment continue into the first part of next year. And again, we're lapping that kind of similar environment last year. So it's not a huge change in trajectory for us. I think what starts to make the back half, in our view, potentially more interesting next year is really a function of the innovation cycles. And we can start to see a line of sight toward even read a little bit about, especially on some of the computing and processing side, devices that might start to feed into that as we head into the back half of next year. And back to Peter's earlier question, we can start to see on the horizon, some of that newness and innovation really on the docket as you head into the back half and into holiday for next year as everyone again, it's pretty incented to want to bring some vitality back to the industry. Steven Zaccone : Thanks very much for the detail. Have a nice Thanksgiving. Corie Barry : Yeah. Thanks. You too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Matuszewski of Jefferies. Your line is open. Jonathan Matuszewski : Great. Thanks for taking my question. First one is on the competitive landscape. So you held market share in 3Q, and that's consistent with your comments in the first half. Obviously, you guys have superior customer service and assortment. So what's driving the success among competitors in the industry, who you're tracking who are taking share? Is it purely a function of price? And how is that informing your pricing strategy over the next couple of quarters? Corie Barry : Again, I'm probably biased, but I don't think it's purely a function of price. I think we've been very clear, we have to be price competitive, and that is one of the base tentpoles of our strategy. And that said, we also, I think, have a team that has a proven track record of very adept promotional planning around key drive times, whether that's some of the secondary holidays or whether it's the main holiday that we're headed into. So I kind of think of price as the like primary tentpole. But in order to differentiate, I think what we're doubling down on is what we do, that is different than anyone else just given who we are. We are agnostic to the customer. So we don't care what the operating system is or who makes the hardware. We're there for the customer to help them to build on that. We have what we like to call human-enabled services. So we can help you in the store. We can consult for you in your home. We can repair. We can take back. We can trade in. You can buy open box. You can go to an outlet. Like, we just have the huge end-to-end variety of solutions all the way from inspire to support, so that's the kind of second differentiator for us. And then third, I think we're building on those things with a unique membership program with unique offers that reach out to our members with a membership program that's based on the things that we uniquely do well. And then fourth, I have to give major credit to our vendor partners as well, even though we're in a little bit of a slower innovation cycle, they remain closely committed to our success, which means we do have everything from the most new beautiful 98-inch TV that's out on the floor, all the way to those opening price point Chromebooks or opening price point televisions that might be right for you at a value play. And I think our ability to showcase those high and new experience as well as all the way through the rest of the assortment really is that last differentiating piece for us. Jonathan Matuszewski : That's great color. Thanks so much. And then a quick follow-up on Best Buy Health. You've had some exciting announcements on that side of the business in terms of partnerships in the industry. At the Investor Day, I think you called out expectations for that to grow at a CAGR of an impressive 40% over the next couple of years. Is that business at scale to switch from kind of dilution to accretion in terms of the overall enterprise next year? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Corie Barry : Yeah. So we remain really excited about the Health business, and we were pretty clear that we had pulled the FY '25 targets on the whole or as the macro backdrop has changed. And so we are, of course, working behind the scenes to really fortify that business for the future. And I know someone had asked earlier as we think about the puts and takes for next year, we would continue to expect Health to become more accretive, and we laid that out as kind of our structural thesis at our Investor Day. And that part of the thesis remains true for us. And while it still is relatively small at this point, we are seeing some nice uptick, particularly in that kind of care-at-home side of things, where we've announced partnerships with Geisinger and with Atrium Health as we think about how we can use our unique Geek Squad assets as well as the unique product assortment that we have to help deliver care at home. So again, relatively small, but the team is doing a nice job continuing to ensure that, that part of the business is accretive and grows over time. Jonathan Matuszewski : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Forbes of Guggenheim. Your line is open. Steven Forbes : Good morning, Corie, Matt. Corie Barry : Good morning. Steven Forbes : Matt, you briefly mentioned 15 to 20 basis points of vendor funding being recorded in expenses. Curious if you can maybe give us a little more color there? And then any sort of different way of thinking about how vendor funding maybe supports the margin outlook for 2024? Or are you changing the 2024 margin color of being able to hold margin in a flat sales environment, any update there? Matt Bilunas : Sure. Yeah. So first of all, it was $15 million to $20 million of impact on net basis points, just to make sure I'm clear. And that would carry on as you get into next quarter Q4 and the first part of next year. And this is strictly a geography. There is no change to the overall financial statements, if you will, just moving as a cost -- offsetting a cost of sales to offsetting SG&A. Essentially, we get any number of types of vendor funding for a number of different things. And when we can actually be more specific with the funding, matching and offsetting the specific cost, we then record that as an offset to SG&A versus offsetting cost of sales. So that's specifically what's happened. And it's just -- it's part of the funding that we get not all of it, obviously. And so we would expect that to continue. To your second question, as you look at next year, at this point, we're not guiding next year, but we would expect product margins to be somewhat of a neutral impact to next year. Overall, we don't, at this point, see a lot of material changes either way. We have a very strong relationship with our vendors, and they are obviously as interested in us in stimulating sales and showcasing their products and innovations that they have. So at this point, we don't see any change to that as we look into next year. Corie Barry : Matt hit on this, but I want to underscore, the way in which our vendors participate with us varies as you would expect, depending on what we're seeing in the macro. Sometimes that shows up as more promotional partnership. But a lot of times, that shows up in very different ways it can be in how we think about specialized labor, it can be in store experiences like we mentioned on the call, it can be in our Best Buy ads business or in supply chain fulfillment or in services. And I think what's important is our overall level of invested support has grown in the aggregate even as we compare it to pre-pandemic levels. And I think that is the part that for us as important is how can we be the very best partner to our vendors as we collectively want to bring, especially some of this newer innovation to market. Steven Forbes : Thank you, Corie and Matt. Maybe just a quick follow-up for you, Corie. Any updated thoughts on maybe some of your newer growth initiatives such as device life cycle management, really just trying to think through whether the current sort of operating performance or challenges that are out there are impacting the investments you plan to put behind some of these initiatives? Or whether that's still sort of a growth sort of plan for next year? Corie Barry : Yeah. As it relates -- you hit on specifically device life cycle management, I'm maybe going to take it up one level and that is, we've talked about Geek Squad as a service, because it can be everything from device cycle management, which is newer side of this, but also just providing service on behalf of vendors as you think about being an Apple authorized service provider or some of our Best Buy business offerings where we actually use our service profile to go out and do installations writ large. What's nice about an initiative like this is it doesn't require, especially in the earlier stages, much incremental investment. We already have Geek Squad City, which is a very large facility, well staffed with trained experts who we can leverage some of their capacities in order to deliver on something like device life cycle management. Now then we can make decisions as something like that ramps. We didn't mention it this quarter because in Q4, honestly, it's not the biggest front and center area of focus. But you can also imagine behind the scenes, if there are other ways for us to leverage our existing expertise and capacity. Those are very interesting strategic initiatives for us. And we remain excited about this one. We remain excited about the pipeline that we're seeing in this one. And obviously, I think you can expect that we will update you with more clarity as it develops. So with that, I think that -- thank you. I think that is our last question, and I want to thank you all for joining us today. Thank you for the nice wishes. I hope you all also have a wonderful holiday, and we look forward to updating you all on our results and progress during our next call in February. Thank you, and have a great day.

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded for playback and will be available at approximately 1 :00 p.m. Eastern Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mollie O'Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call.  I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm proud of the performance of our teams across the company as they showed resourcefulness, passion and unwavering focus on our customers this past year. Throughout fiscal '24, we demonstrated strong operational execution as we navigated a pressured CE sales environment. This allowed us to deliver annual profitability at the high end of our original guidance range even though sales came in below our original guidance range. Importantly, we grew our paid membership base and drove customer experience improvements in many areas of our business, particularly in services and delivery.  For Q4 specifically, we are reporting profitability at the high end of our expectations, with revenue near the middle of our guidance range. Our comparable sales declined 4.8% in the quarter. At the same time, we expanded our gross profit rate 50 basis points from last year due to profitability improvements in our membership program as well as Best Buy Health.  Excluding the impact of the extra week, we lowered our SG&A expense compared to last year as we tightly controlled expenses and adjusted our labor expense rate with sales fluctuations. As expected, customers were very deal-focused through the holiday season, and the promotional environment overall was in line with our expectations. While shopping patterns more closely resembled historical holiday periods and Black Friday and Cyber Week performances were in line with our expectations, the sales lull in December was even steeper than we had modeled. Then customer demand strengthened considerably and was higher than we expected during the 4 days before Christmas.  Our Q4 digital sales mix was flat to last year at 38% of total domestic sales. Customer in-store pickup of online orders was also consistent at 44%. We improved our delivery speeds, expanding the percent of ship-to-home online orders delivered in 2 days. We have been very focused on getting our app in the hands of customers. And I'm pleased to say that on Black Friday, it ranked #3 across shopping apps and #4 across all apps on Apple's App Store.  We ended the quarter and year with 7 million members across our 2-tiered My Best Buy paid memberships. Paid members consistently showed higher levels of interaction with comparatively higher levels of spend at Best Buy and a shift of spend away from competitors. From a financial perspective, membership delivered another quarter of higher-than-expected operating income rate contribution. When you include the changes we made to the free tier and the impact of the midyear changes we made to the paid program benefits, our membership program contributed approximately 45 basis points of enterprise year-over-year operating income rate expansion for the full year. And our Best Buy Health business achieved its operating income contribution target of 10 basis points for the year. In addition, we announced strategic partnerships with Advocate Health, Geisinger Health and Mass General Brigham, and our care at home platform is now being used in 8 of the top 20 health systems in the U.S.  Now I would like to look forward to fiscal '25. We expect this to be a year of increasing industry stabilization. Our strategy is to focus on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding, our operating income rate on a 52-week basis. Therefore, our fiscal '25 priorities are as follows : one, invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences; two, drive operational effectiveness and efficiency; three, continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation; and four, explore, pilot and drive incremental revenue streams.  There's a lot to unpack. I'll start with a discussion about the macro environment, the CE industry and our sales expectations. At the highest level, there have been and continue to be macro pressures impacting retail overall and CE more specifically.  First, inflation has been slowing, but prices for the basics like food and lodging are still much higher and consumers have to prioritize and make trade-off spend decisions. Second, there is a consumer propensity to spend on services like concerts and vacations in lieu of goods, which has remained sticky even as the prices there too have inflated.  Third, we have a relatively stagnant housing market. Fourth, CE was a significant recipient of a pull forward of demand during the first 2 years of the pandemic. When consumers need to prioritize the basics that usually does not include the product purchases they recently pulled forward. And lastly, the level of CE product innovation has been lowered during the pandemic and supply chain challenged years. It's not so much about each of these individually, but when you stack the five, it has been a heavy weight on the industry. On the positive side, experience tells us that these are all cyclical and transient in nature. And while they are ebbing and flowing, we are optimistic that several indicators will continue to show favorability this year. These include decreasing inflation leading to the lowering of interest rates, continued low unemployment, encouraging trends in consumer confidence and the beginnings of a housing market rebound.  We remain confident that our industry will grow again after 2 years of declines. This is simply a matter of the timing. Our underlying thesis is consistent. First, we believe that much of the growth during the pandemic was incremental, creating a larger installed base of technology products in consumers' homes.  Second, we expect to see the benefit of the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the tech bot early in the pandemic kick in this year and into the next few years. Third, we are returning to a more normalized pace of meaningful innovation after a pause during the pandemic. Taking all these factors and considerations into account, we expect fiscal '25 comparable sales to be flat to last year on the high end of our guidance range, down in the first half and up in the second half of the year. The low end of our annual comp sales range is a decline of 3%, reflecting a scenario where the mix of the factors I just discussed results in lower customer demand.  From a category standpoint, we expect sales in our computing category to improve through the year and show growth for the full year as early replacement and upgrade cycles gain momentum and new products featuring even more AI capabilities are released as we move through the year. We are already beginning to see the improvement as year-over-year comparable sales for laptops turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter and are trending positively so far this quarter.  At this point in time, we expect revenue for the rest of our product categories to stabilize through the year and be flattish to slightly down for the full year, partially offset by the continued growth of our services revenue. Even though overall, we are expecting flattish sales growth for the full year, there are many examples of innovation both already introduced and expected through the year that we believe will drive interest including the Samsung AI-enabled phone we are already seeing materially more demand than we expected, new emerging content for VR/AR devices, Ray-Ban smart glasses, Bose open year headphones, EV universal charging devices and a proliferation of 98-inch screen TVs, to name a few.  Also, the level of exciting and cool new tech at the Consumer Electronics Show in January felt back to normal. Of course, some of that cool new tech hits the market over the following year while some of it is still a few years from consumer launch.  Now I would like to provide more details on some of the key initiatives within each of our fiscal '25 priorities to capitalize on that industry stability. As I mentioned, our first priority is to invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences. Our first initiative is to materially elevate personalization. We are focused on providing increasingly personalized, highly relevant and motivational content for our known identified customers. We can attribute roughly 90% of our annual revenue to known customers.  Let's start with our efforts around our paid membership program. Here, we're creating seamless, tailored experiences for our members based on their unique preferences or context. Our app first member deals experience is a great example of this. Rather than bombarding our members with thousands of great member deals, we focus on the experience on the most relevant offers based on their preferences and observed member data.  Additionally, we're adding personalization across the membership journey, including in-store at POS, where later this year will include props to provide both sales associates and customers with relevant contextual information about their membership like their savings, rewards, protection plans and offers. We will also include personalized dynamic messaging in our communications to members about their upcoming program renewals. These efforts and more will serve to increase membership engagement and continue to improve retention. As we think about our broader known customer base, we are fortunate to have a tremendous amount of first-party customer data for our advanced analytics capabilities to leverage. While we are elevating personalization across our customer interactions, I'm particularly excited about the work we are doing with our app. We are currently testing a personalization-centric version of the app homepage with the stories and actions that matter most to customers, along with critical content and plan to launch to all customers during the second quarter.  The second initiative is to invest back into our store experience. Our stores are crucial assets that provide customers with differentiated experiences, services and convenient multichannel fulfillment. Customer shopping behavior has evolved in the last 4 years. And this year, we are particularly focused on ensuring we provide the experience that customers expect to have when they take the time to come into our stores.  As a result, our capital investments for fiscal '25 are concentrated more on existing store updates and refreshes and less on major remodels or store openings. We plan to touch every single store in the chain in some fashion, improving both our merchandising and ease of shopping for customers.  This includes improving and livening the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the sales floor. It also includes rightsizing a number of categories to ensure we're leveraging the space in the center of our stores in the most exciting, relevant and efficient way possible. For example, we will be removing physical media and updating our mobile digital imaging, computing, tablets and smart home departments.  We are also excited to partner even more with our vendors this year as it relates to their branded in-store merchandise experiences. The coming innovation, combined with our plan to refresh every store in our fleet, provides much more opportunity for vendor investments in our stores. A few examples I can share at this time include Tesla, LoveSac and Starlink. Although we still see opportunities for additional large experienced store remodels, we believe we have a better opportunity to improve existing store experiences at scale in fiscal '25. At the same time, we are planning to open a few additional outlet centers and new formats to continue to test 2 important concepts.  First, we will open small locations in a couple of out state markets where we have no prior physical presence and our omnichannel sales penetration is low to measure our ability to capture untapped share. Second, we will test our ability to close a large format store and open a small format store nearby, thereby maximizing physical store retention through convenience. These learnings will collectively continue to help us refine our forward-looking store strategy. In addition to a great physical experience, we want to ensure our customers receive the expert service interactions they want and Best Buy is known for when they come to our stores. During fiscal '25, we will continue to leverage our multiskilled store associates, but in hundreds of stores we will also add back fully dedicated expertise in key categories like major appliances, home theater and computing.  Our plan is to deploy some of our most skilled sellers against these categories and double down on category-specific training and certifications for these employees. We know that our selling certifications create a better experience for our customers as our certified employees on average drive nearly 15% higher revenue per transaction and garner higher Net Promoter Scores than a noncertified employee.  In fact, the third initiative under our drive targeted customer experiences priority is to make sure we are prepared to bring coming innovation to life for customers in ways no one else can. This means we need to be ready to leverage the unique strengths that make us the best place for customers to see new tech and the best partner for vendors to launch NewTek.  This includes everything from expertly trained associates who can explain the new technology and what it can do for you, the best merchandising presentation both in-store and online, all the way to great trade-in values for customers who use technology. This will be particularly important later this year when more computing products featuring AI are expected to launch.  As a reminder, we hold 1/3 of the retail market share in both the U.S. computing and television industries, roughly 20% in gaming and well over 10% share in other categories like major appliances. We intend to strengthen our position in these key categories through the initiatives I just outlined as well as pointed marketing spend and sharp pricing.  Our second key priority for the year is to drive operational effectiveness and efficiency. We have a longstanding commitment to identifying cost reductions and driving efficiencies to help offset inflationary pressures in our business and fund investment capacity for new and existing initiatives.  Our fiscal '25 initiatives are focused on driving further efficiencies across forward and reverse supply chain, our Geek Squad repair operations and our customer care experience. We will continue to lean heavily on analytics and technology to achieve these efficiencies. This includes leveraging AI safely and effectively.  Let me provide a few specific examples of how we are leveraging it. One, we're using AI to route our in-home delivery and installation trucks to drive more efficient scheduling and a better customer experience. Two, we are leveraging AI to summarize the main points and follow-ups from each of our customer service calls. It also improves the accuracy of the interaction and data collection while reducing average engagement time by almost 5%. To help us enhance our overall tech development effectiveness we are leveraging gen AI code generation and shared resources for our engineers. We are also establishing a digital and technology hub in Bangalore, India, which will give us expanded, more economical access to talent and skills. The hub will open and begin the process of onboarding team members later this year.  In addition, in fiscal '25, we are taking actions to, one, ensure our resources are directed at the right strategic areas; and two, to rightsize our model based on current operations. These actions will allow us to do the following : balance field labor resources to make sure we are providing the optimal experience for customers where they want to shop, redirect corporate resources to make sure we have the necessary assets dedicated to areas like AI and other elements of our strategy and rightsize parts of the business where we expect to see lower volume than we envisioned a few years ago. whether that is the result of lower industry sales or due to decisions we made like evolving our paid membership benefits.  While we made these decisions during the fourth quarter, which resulted in a restructuring charge that Matt will discuss later, many of the actions will be implemented through the first half of fiscal '25 and we will provide more details as we move through the year.  Our third key priority for the year is to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. This will include striking the appropriate balance of prioritizing areas that best position us for the future while prudently dealing with the near-term uncertainty in the CE industry. There are a few key points that I want to highlight. First, as it relates to our capital allocation strategy, our overall approach isn't changing. We still plan to first fund operations and investments in areas necessary to grow our business, and next, return excess free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Second, while our enterprise capital expenditures for fiscal '25 are planned at a similar level to last year, our Domestic segment capital expenditures are expected to decline by approximately $50 million due to the store portfolio investment approach I discussed earlier and lower technology-related expense. This is offset by a year-over-year planned increase in CapEx in Canada to reflect investments for new stores and necessary supply chain automation projects.  Third, and consistent with our practice over the past several years, we will continue to tightly manage our working capital. Our teams have done a tremendous job managing our inventory in a very uneven sales environment, keeping inventory aligned with our forward-looking sales projections while, at the same time, maintaining as much flexibility as possible. And lastly, this morning, we announced a 2% increase in our quarterly dividend. This represents the 11th straight year of dividend increases and puts our current dividend yield near 5%.  Our fourth key priority for fiscal '25 is longer term in focus. We will continue to explore opportunities that leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental profitable revenue streams over time. The most developed example of this is Best Buy Health, where we are leveraging our expertise and our Geek Squad agents to capitalize on the growing use of technology to help provide health care in the home.  While still very small in relation to our core business, our fiscal '25 Best Buy Health sales are expected to grow faster than the core business, which, combined with cost synergies from fully integrating acquired companies, are expected to drive another 10 basis points of enterprise operating income rate expansion.  Another example is our recently announced collaboration with Bell Canada to operate 165 small-format consumer electronics retail stores across Canada. These stores, previously known as The Source, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Canada, will be rebranded as Best Buy Express. We will provide the CE assortment as well as supply chain, marketing and e-commerce. Bell will continue to be the exclusive telecommunication services provider and will also be responsible for the store operating costs and labor components of the partnership. This collaboration will allow us to expand our presence in malls and in smaller and midsized communities across Canada. Best Buy Express stores are expected to roll out during the second half of this year.  Other examples of opportunities we are pursuing include continuing to build out our business case for Geek Squad as a service and adding vendors to our supply chain partner plus program.  Before I close and turn the call over to Matt, I wanted to touch on a few of the ways we are being recognized for the support we provide to our employees and communities. From an employee standpoint, I'm proud to share that we continue to maintain industry low turnover rates and our fiscal '24 employee turnover was down on a year-over-year basis.  To that end, this is our second year as the #1 retailer on the Just Capital List, which evaluates and ranks the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S., in part on how a company invests in its workforce. This year will also mark the fifth anniversary of our caregiver pay benefit. During that time, we've supported 22,000 employees with almost 3 million hours of time away, so they could care for those who matter most.  We continue to be credited as a leader in sustainability. In Q4, for the 13th year, we were named to the annual Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We were also just named for the seventh consecutive year, to the CDP's prestigious Climate A List, which looks at how organizations demonstrate best practices associated with environmental leadership.  In summary, we are focused and energized about delivering on our purpose to Enrich Lives through Technology in a vibrant, always changing industry. We don't assort tech products just for the sake of technology. We see technology and service of humans. And as the largest CE specialty retailer with our unique range of product assortment and expert services, we deliver that human experience to millions of customers.  I want to reiterate our fiscal '25 strategy in what we expect to be a year of increasing industry stabilization we are focused on sharpening our customer experiences and industry positioning while maintaining, if not expanding our operating income rate on a 52-week basis. We are putting ourselves in the best position for fiscal '25 and beyond. As our industry returns to growth, we expect to grow our sales and expand our operating income rate.  I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q4 financial performance and our outlook. Matthew Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. Before getting into our quarterly results, let me start by sharing a few details on the extra week that occurred in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the extra week added approximately $735 million in enterprise revenue and approximately $0.30 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to the quarter. Also as a reminder, revenue from the extra week is excluded from our comparable sales calculation.  Next, I will share details on the fourth quarter results including the extra week. Enterprise revenue of $14.6 billion declined 4.8% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5% improved 20 basis points compared to last year and included a 50 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate.  Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were $30 million higher than last year and increased approximately 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Compared to last year, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.72.  When viewing our performance compared to our expectations, revenue was near the midpoint of our guidance. As Corie mentioned, our comparable sales trends were not linear, with the more traditional holiday shopping days being our strongest from a growth perspective. Our comparable sales by month were November, down 5%; December, down 2%; and January, down 12%.  Although our sales were near the midpoint of our guidance, our non-GAAP operating income rate of 5% was at the high end. Our gross profit rate was higher than we expected, primarily driven by a more favorable gross profit rate in our services category, which includes our membership offerings. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense was near the high end of our expectations due to additional incentive compensation. Next, I will walk through the details of our fourth quarter results compared to last year. In our Domestic segment, revenue decreased 0.9% to $13.4 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 5.1% and was partially offset by approximately $675 million in revenue from the extra week. From a category standpoint, the largest contributors to comparable sales decline in the quarter were home theater, appliances, mobile phones and tablets, which were partially offset by growth in gaming.  From organic's perspective, the overall blended average selling price of our products was slightly higher than last year. The growth was primarily due to an increased mix of units coming from higher ticket items such as notebooks and TVs, even though the individual ASPs for both of those categories were down year-over-year. International revenue of $1.2 billion increased 2.7%, primarily driven by approximately $60 million of revenue from the extra week, which was partially offset by a comparable sales decline of 1.4%. Our domestic gross profit rate increased 60 basis points to 20.4%. The higher gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvements from our membership offerings, which included a higher gross profit rate in our services category.  In addition, the higher gross profit rate from our Best Buy Health initiatives also contributed to the improved rate. The previous items were partially offset by lower product margin rates. Consistent with the third quarter, approximately $20 million of vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A, which was a reduction to cost of sales last year. We anticipate a similar recognition of this funding in the first half of fiscal '25 or approximately $20 million a quarter.  Moving to SG&A. Our Domestic non-GAAP SG&A increased $17 million, which was primarily driven by the extra week and higher incentive compensation, which were partially offset by lower store payroll costs and reduced advertising expense. Our International non-GAAP SG&A increased $13 million, which was primarily driven by higher incentive compensation and the extra week. In the fourth quarter, as Corie alluded to, we incurred $169 million in restructuring costs. The related actions span multiple areas across our organization and include approximately $65 million for actions that won't be implemented until fiscal '26.  Moving to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash. Our year-end inventory balance was approximately 4% lower than last year's comparable period, and we continue to feel good about our overall inventory position as well as the health of our inventory. During fiscal '24, our total capital expenditures were $795 million versus $930 million in fiscal '23. The largest drivers of the year-over-year decline was a reduction in store-related investments. We also returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Moving on to our full year fiscal '25 financial guidance, which is the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $41.3 billion to $42.6 billion; Enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to flat; Enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.9% to 4.1%, which compares to an estimated 4% non-GAAP operating income rate for fiscal '24 on a 52-week basis; a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.75 to $6.20.  In addition, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $750 million to $800 million. And lastly, we expect to spend approximately $350 million on share repurchases, which is similar to our fiscal '24 spend.  Next, I will cover some of the key working assumptions that support our guidance. As our ongoing practice, we will continue to close existing traditional stores during our rigorous review of stores as their leases come up for renewal. In fiscal '24, we closed 24 stores. And in fiscal '25, we expect to close 10 to 15 stores. Earlier, Corie provided context on our fiscal '25 top line assumptions. Let me spend more time on the profitability outlook. We expect to drive gross profit rate expansion of 20 to 30 basis points compared to fiscal '24 due to the following actions and initiatives.  First, continued profitability improvements of our services and membership offerings is expected to provide approximately 45 basis points of gross profit rate expansion. The achievement of this improvement essentially recoups the original investment of our previous Total Tech offering that was scaled nationally in October of 2021. The expected rate improvement is due to higher revenue from installation and delivery services, which were previously included benefits of paid membership and a lower cost to serve due to lower expected volume for in-home installation and other related services. The unit volume of these services is still expected to be above pre-pandemic levels but below the elevated levels we experienced when Total Tech members receive them as a benefit at no incremental cost. We also expect Best Buy Health to add a benefit of approximately 10 basis points to our enterprise profit -- gross profit rate on a year-over-year basis.  Partially offsetting the previous items is approximately 20 basis points expected pressure from a lower profit share on a credit card arrangement. In fiscal '24, our profit share was approximately 1.4% of domestic revenue, consistent with fiscal '23. The expected pressure in fiscal '25 is primarily due to expected increases in net credit losses. This estimate does not include implications from any proposed changes to late fee regulation. We also expect that our product margin rates will experience slight pressure.  Now moving to our SG&A expectations. The high end of our guidance assumes SG&A dollars are similar to fiscal '24, which includes the following puts and takes. We expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year with the high end of our guidance assuming an increase of $40 million compared to fiscal '24. We expect advertising expense to increase by approximately $50 million.  Partially offsetting previous items is the benefit of 1 less week, which is estimated at approximately $90 million. Store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal '24 as a percentage of sales. Lastly, the low end of our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses to align with sales trends. Before I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the first quarter. We anticipate that our first quarter comparable sales will decline approximately 5%, which aligns with our estimated February performance. We expect our non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately flat to fiscal '24 first quarter rate of 3.4%.  We expect our gross profit rate to improve compared to last year, in line with the 20 to 30 basis point improvement we are expecting for the full year. SG&A dollars are expected to decline as a percentage in the low single-digit range with the decrease primarily due to lower store payroll expense. I will now turn the call over to operator for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Scot Ciccarelli : This is probably difficult to answer but I'd be interested in any color you might have. When you kind of look at the comp performance and the comp decline, how would you segment it between, let's call it, broader pressures on discretionary spending versus, let's call it, the pull forward of demand that happened during the pandemic? Because we're kind of getting into that kind of 4-year period since the pandemic. Typical life cycle of a lot of your products is 3 to 5 years. Just how are you guys kind of thinking about that? Or is it at all possible to segment that? Corie Barry : I wish there was an exact science to this one. That being said, we did try to give you in the prepared remarks a few indicators that we're seeing that say we might be starting to get into that replacement cycle. We talked specifically about laptop units returning to growth in Q4 and that trend continuing here as we head into Q1. That, to me, feels like an early indicator of at least some foray into that replacement cycle.  Because honestly, really, right now, there isn't any massive current innovation that would spur you to go buy a new laptop. There's a little bit but we're expecting more as the year goes on. And then obviously, that -- the laptop category would be kind of earlier in the realm of replacement cycles that we've talked about.  So I think you're starting to see some goodness there, Scot, which makes me think a little bit more of the overhang that we're seeing is that kind of combo batter of 5 macro factors that I talked about that continue to weigh on the industry and haven't abated nearly to the pace that I think anyone thought from a macro perspective. Scot Ciccarelli : That's helpful, Corie. And then one other quick one. Like, you guys talked a bit earlier in the script on personalization. I guess the question is for your kind of category, do you get enough frequency in terms of customer visits to really be able to little leverage that data and the personalization that you're targeting? Corie Barry : I think what's important is to differentiate purchase frequency from the frequency of interacting with the brand. And we have the luxury because we do know -- like I said, 90% of our purchasing customers we can identify, we can actually see many behaviors. And people don't just come to us because they want to make a purchase.  There's a lot of research done in the category. There are repairs done in the category. There are curiosity about upgrades done in the category. And so we do see enough frequency of visits and our ability to understand how the consumer is acting that do allow us to make those personalizations.  And that's why one of the things that we mentioned and why we try to get really specific examples is in the app, having that personalized front page means we're not just targeting you for what you might purchase next. We're literally trying to figure out your next best action, and that action might just be discovery. You might just want to come and scroll through and take a look at what's new or what's coming and educate yourself. And we will gladly help you do that. And so I think the next realm of personalization -- I think personalization often gets lumped in with purchase. And it's for us, in particular, because we really deal with the full life cycle of how people use these products, it's a lot broader than that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel : So I want to start, Corie, bigger picture. You mentioned in your prepared comments, I know we've been talking a while about this AI. We talked about some of the products and then how Best Buy's utilizing AI in its own business model. The question I have is as you're talking now to your vendor partners, maybe going back to CES or before, how much excitement is starting to really build around AI as -- in terms of products that we could see in the relative near term for Best Buy, from a consumer base standpoint? Corie Barry : Yes. I will give you my very best qualitative answer here. I think if you followed what happened at the Consumer Electronics Show in January at all, it was, I would argue, the largest foray into how AI will impact our world going forward from here, particularly as it relates to consumer electronics.  And I think in the coming year, there's enough noise out there that you can get this feel that you're going to start to see the computing side of this really start to take light and make it easier and more seamless for everyone to be able to use tools that will help them be more efficient and effective.  But the horizon question, and that's how I like to think about it, I like to think about it as the kind of innovation horizon, I think, is really vibrant right now in terms of what AI technology might be able to do. Because it's not just compute. It gets into like how smart can I make the things around me. And one of the other things that's really interesting about AI is it actually makes consumer electronics products more human. And so there's this question of how do I make these CE products interact with me more seamlessly? How are the robots that are in my house even smarter because they can triangulate faster and they just get smarter on their own? So my little robot vacuum gets smarter every single time that I use it, right? And so these aren't just innovations in the compute side of things. You're starting to see it in the phone side of things. You're starting to see it and how far can we kind of push the envelope on what consumer electronics can do for you in your home to just make your home life more seamless.  So I'm not saying it's going to be a revolution overnight, Brian, to be clear. But I do definitely see more excitement and kind of this unlock in how technology can fit even more seamlessly into your life. Brian Nagel : That's very, very helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up, unrelated. With regard to the [Technical Difficulty] normalization within the CE category, you talked about through the holiday promotions being, I guess, normal. But the question I have is, are you seeing more nonspecific CE retailers come back to the category now as the overall consumer backdrop normalizes post pandemic? Corie Barry : I wouldn't say there's more. I mean, I think when we were headed into holiday, we said this is typically a category that is promotional. It's typically a category that many different partners play in for the holiday because whether or not it blew the doors off, it is always a category that people look for as it relates to holiday. And so I think you always see some players come in and out of the space as it relates to gifting and CE as a gift. And I -- my personal point of view, didn't see more than we would have expected this holiday than any other. Obviously, we're always watching the competitive landscape. But I think that's why we're really focused in the coming year on our unique positioning in the CE landscape and the both pre-purchase and then post-purchase offerings that we have that are pretty unique in the marketplace, no matter who enters it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : It's on market share trends. Best Buy has always been very dynamic with its strategy. It's one of the factors that has led to its success that it's been able to change with the market, but it does seem like in the last several years the pace of change with the strategy has increased significantly, whether it comes to membership, store format, the composition of store associates. How do you think this is having an impact on Best Buy's market share especially in light of the fact that if we look at Best Buy sales in the Domestic segment for this year, it's likely that the company is going to be on pace to have sales that are about $2 billion below where they were in 2019. Corie Barry : Yes. So let me start a little near term and then I'll work my way back to a little bit longer term. You're right, there have been a number of strategic pivots in the model. And to be clear, this is in service of bolstering our position in the market. That is why we are making the changes that we are, and it's also in service of a changing consumer who expects a different experience. So we've said it many times, Michael, and I know you're familiar. There isn't a great single source of share here for consumer electronics because nobody covers all the categories that we do.  But for the Circana track categories, which represent about 70% of our revenue, we held share in Q4 and for the full year, year-over-year. With the same caveats as I think about the last several years, and this is one we have to try to analyze multiple sources over a longer-term period. We believe we've actually largely held share in the key categories since the beginning of the pandemic.  Like I said, it is a difficult science because there are so many different sources. But you can imagine, as you started with the question, strategically, we are incredibly focused on those real key categories that are important and underline our strategy to really kind of own that home experience and that CE experience end-to-end for our consumers.  So we are tracking this carefully, and I can promise you that the changes to the model are not for the fun of it. The changes are definitely in service of different customer expectations and our commitment to hold position in this industry. Michael Lasser : Got it. My follow-up question is, as we look at our model and make an assessment of what the recovery in consumer electronics retail looks like over the next few years, what is the rule of thumb that we should be using in regards to Best Buy sales versus its operating margin and the amount of leverage that the model will produce in light of all the changes that have been made in the last few years? Is there a rule of thumb that you can give us to guide us on how we should be projecting over the next couple of years? Matthew Bilunas : Yes, Michael, I'll take that. I think if I look at just going forward in an ideal setting, when you get past the flat to slightly down year this year, we do expect when you look out into the next number of years that the industry will continue to grow and that we will grow along with it.  I think it is our expectation that we will continue to grow sales. It's our expectation that we will continue to expand our operating profit rate as we do that. And to your point, part of that is we expect to be able to leverage on SG&A and take advantage of not just all the initiatives that are adding to our improvements over this last year, but also just a good focus on cost control and efficiency.  And so I think by that center, I'm not going to give you a specific how much does rate improve by every point of comp. But it would be our expectation as we grow a few percentage points, we will be able to expand our rate.  And I think year-to-year, I think that takes on a little different color as you think about one given year and you move into next year with a different level of operating revenue with a consistent level of cost structure. You can imagine that it does help expand your rate a little bit more as you go from one year to the next. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Seth Sigman with Barclays. Seth Sigman : I wanted to follow up on the sales outlook. As you think about sales down in the first half, up in the second half, any more views on the role that housing and moving activity plays in that? I think some of our work has suggested that there is an impact, but obviously, it's not the only driver. Innovation and a lot of the other things you talked about makes sense. But I guess, how do you think about housing and what's embedded here in the outlook as you think about the opportunity for improvement? Corie Barry : You said it very well. It's not a perfect correlation with our business, the housing market, I mean. But there are definitely pieces of the business that tend to correlate more highly, particularly as you think about appliances, and then somewhat as you kind of creep into television. Those tend to be the areas that are most highly correlated. In the prepared remarks, I talked about that kind of stacked macro pressures on CE. And then alluded to the fact that the high end of the range at a flat comp for the year, we're assuming that a few of these in particular start to abate. You're starting to see inflation pull back a bit, that one is important. And also, you are starting to at least see the -- what I'd like to call the green shoots of the housing market maybe start to turn in a bit more positive direction.  So I would assume that in that -- again, at that top end of the guide that we were talking about, we continue to maybe see a bit of that slow progression of improvement.  There is nothing that would say we expect changes overnight. There's nothing that would say we expect all of a sudden, it's all sunshine and roses in the housing market. But I think in general, we're starting to see enough of the green shoots that make you feel like, yes, there might be a bit of improvement there that helps buoy at least that part of the business.  That being said, we also said on the downside scenario at a down 3% comp maybe don't see the level of recovery in any of those macro factors that we talked about. So I think that's why we're prudently trying to create a range that acknowledges we're early in the year and early in, trying to see some of the recovery in some of these more cyclical macro items. Seth Sigman : Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then my follow-up, as you think about online sales growth seem to outpace store comps very slightly but for the first time since 2020. And I appreciate the role that stores and online both play in driving a seamless transaction. But I'm just curious, anything notable that you're seeing as it relates to consumer behavior across the channels? And how does that tie in with your store closure plans? Corie Barry : I think we've had a pretty consistent view on the fact that we believe online penetration -- we kind of said we'll first stabilize because it went so high during the pandemic, we knew there'd be some level of pullback. And the last -- I'm going to call it like 18 months have been a little bit more around, where does it stabilize, particularly as a percent of our overall revenue.  And that, for the last year, has been a little bit more stable year-over-year in terms of penetration of digital sales. But our forward-looking hypothesis has been that at a more normalized pace, we probably continue to see online penetration continues to increase.  Now you led in with what I want to remind everyone, which is this is not a channel that is taken alone in and of itself. The other interesting fact that we laid out in the prepared remarks is that 44% of what we sell online is still picked up in a store. And that number was consistent year-over-year, even though we're shipping faster and we talked about our ability to ship in 2 days even faster than the year before.  And so for our model, in particular, there is this really important interplay between the digital sales, even as they keep penetrating, and the convenience and the ability to ubiquitously search online but also go into the store, if I would like to, regardless of where I choose to make the purchase, which is why we are moving at a methodical pace, I would say, in terms of the evolution of our store footprint.  And that's why I also believe this year, our focus is more on touching as many stores as we can and making sure that, that shopping experience feels good, carefully thinking about what the right portfolio looks like over the longer period. And I think Matt and the team have done a really nice job continuing to make sure we are in the right places at the right time and then testing our way into what we think the right footprint of the future is.  Because it's just not as easy as, is it stores or is it online? It really is the interplay between the 2 uniquely, I would argue, for us as a consumer electronic specialty retailer. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Katharine McShane with Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : Just back to the comp range, I was wondering how we should think about traffic versus ticket when it comes to the down 3% to flat. It seems like there are some moving parts in ticket, and we just wanted to better understand the dynamic of maybe some pressure on prices versus mix. Matthew Bilunas : Yes. Sure, Kate. When you think about it in the next year, I think what we've been seeing, if I look just back at last year, we saw our average selling prices be a little more pressured in the -- a little bit in the first part of the year and then it started to stabilize in Q3, and in Q4, in fact, our average selling price was up compared to last year. And some of that was this unit mix that we talked about. As well as we look to next year, we clearly are trying to see both -- some level of ASP stabilization, some unit growth, which is why we've seen such a promotional environment to kind of stimulate the unit side of this equation.  And so I think it all kind of obviously depends by category. And I think the carriers are at somewhat different phases in their -- where is the right ASP to drive the right type of unit velocity. And so I think probably somewhat, I would guess, next year similar to what we've seen this year. There could be quarters where you see a little ASP pressure, a little bit more coming from units and vice versa. So hard to know exactly by quarter, but it's probably nothing too dissimilar from what we've seen in the last year. Katharine McShane : Okay. And our second question was just on the usage of your credit cards, if you're seeing anything different. Or did you see anything change in the fourth quarter in terms of frequency or size of transaction? Matthew Bilunas : No, nothing really different in terms of usage. It's still an amazing offering for us. We have about 25% of our sales transacted on our card, which has been pretty consistent for the past 5 years. Last year, it was still 1.4% of our domestic sales similar to FY '23. So nothing too different in terms of the usage. And in fact, we still see a continued level of our card being used for external purchases. That's been growing over the last number of years. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Gregory Melich : I wanted to follow up on membership and services. Could you give us an update there in terms of either household or a number of members or what percentage of services revenues are there and what behavior you're seeing? Corie Barry : Yes. We haven't explicitly broken out the percent of services, that is, membership. But we did say we now have 7 million members, and that is compared to 5.8 million at the start of the year. During Q4, we actually signed up 35% more paid members compared to the fourth quarter of last year. So remember that we have a new tier in there. So we have the My Total and the My Best Buy Plus. And so that has driven some growth. And I think it's important to remember, our goal here is to drive engagement and increased share of wallet.  And what we do is we're doing that across 3 main aspects. You hit on acquisition. But there's also -- we talked on the call about engagement and retention. And I think we're happy because, right now, our paid members continue to interact with the brand more frequently compared to nonmembers.  And in addition, as we've been analyzing incremental spend that says -- based on data from Circana that indicates that our Total Tech members are shifting their share of wallet to us as well.  So it's not just about how many of them are using services but it's also about how frequently are they interacting with the brand? And are we keeping them loyal to the Best Buy brand. And I think we're happy, again, with what we're seeing so far there and making good progress. We haven't yet lapped the new rollout. So we still have a little bit of time to understand just how well we're doing in that vein. But right now, we're really happy with our ability to acquire members. Matthew Bilunas : And maybe just for a little additional context, the services growth you see at 6% in Q4, that growth was driven more by increased revenue collected from our installation business. As Corie mentioned, we've shifted -- we've changed our membership program. So we're seeing more of that revenue growth now come off the installation revenue that we're now collecting because it's no longer part of the benefits of Total Tech. And so although we're growing more members, the price point is changing a bit. So you see more growth coming from the insulation business from a dollar perspective than you would have seen in previous quarters. Gregory Melich : Great. And then my follow-up is on that is really -- I think you mentioned that ad expense or marketing expense will be up $50 million this year. Could you just say what that's on? And I'm curious, are there any efforts to use all -- the data that you're getting, whether it's from your members or just customers in general, to maybe get some revenue from all that data and insight? Matthew Bilunas : Sure. I'll start, and then Corie can jump on the last part of the question. I think overall, we're adding about $50 million of advertising expense this year. It's for a number of different things, and I'll give you a couple of items. First, we are expecting a brand relaunch in the back half of this year. So some of this money is used for some additional branding spend that we have. I would say also this is a very unique year in terms of we have things like the Olympics and presidential election. So the inflation on marketing actually comes up in these periods of time, which is part of that increase.  We are also trying to ensure that we are positioned right across our key categories and making sure we have the right amount of low funnel marketing spend pointed at growing our categories when we need to. So I think it's a collection of those things that I would explain. It all adds up to that $50 million. So again, positioning ourselves for a great stabilization and growth in the future and making sure we're in the market in the right spots. Corie Barry : And I love the question about data. It's one of the most powerful tools we have in terms of how we reach our customers. And so we have a Best Buy Ads business. That continues to grow top line collections and profitability and it's been outpacing our core business, I think, as you would expect. And I think it's important to know, this isn't new for us. I mean, at Best Buy we've had very close partnerships with our vendors for a very long time in terms of our advertising. It has gotten more scientific. It has gotten a lot more personalized. And I think that first-party data that we have is much more powerful than it has ever been historically. And obviously, we can also leverage our strong share position in places like even smart TV where we do have established relationships and partnerships with both Amazon on Fire TV and Roku. And so we also have partnerships that allow us to partner on those leading streaming platforms, and we can grow that advertising business and deliver even more value to our vendor partners through some of the partnerships we have uniquely there. So you're right, the data that we have stretches, not only on our own platforms like the app, but stretches into how uniquely we can serve those customers. Operator : Today's final question will come from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Feldman : I want to follow up, can you share a little more color on the store refreshes and what we should expect to see over the course of the year as you do touch up the stores and maybe make them a little more engaging from a merchandising standpoint? Corie Barry : Yes, absolutely. Let me start with, to be clear, we're not remodeling every store in the fleet. So I have to be clear there. But what we are doing is taking, I would argue, kind of a stronger position than we ever have to ensure that the shopping experience reflects that kind of excitement and that sparkle that technology brings to life.  So we've given examples before like some of the investments that we are making in our end caps and those vendor experiences that you see throughout the store, super important positions in the store because they tend to be the most customer facing. And so you're going to see us continue to bring those to life. I think you're also going to see us rightsize a number of the categories and that's particular emphasis on that center of the store area because we want that excitement. We want that relevancy. We also want to be efficient for our associates. And so we're moving physical media, updating mobile, digital imaging, computing, tablets and smart home, things that allows us to make that center of the store really feel a bit more vibrant and exciting.  And so the goal here is not that every single store is going to look like an experience store. The goal though is that every single one has a bit of a refreshed look and feel, has more of those vendor partnership opportunities and has a better ability for our associates to merchandise in a way that makes everything feel kind of full and exciting.  And with that -- do you have a follow-up, Joe, sorry? Joseph Feldman : No, no, no, that's good. We can end it there. Corie Barry : No, no problem. Thanks for the question. And with that, that was our last question. I want to thank everyone for joining us today during what I know is a very busy earnings season. We look forward to updating you on our results and progress during our next call in May. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you all for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to Best Buy's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for playback and will be available by approximately 1 :00 PM Eastern Standard Time today. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference call over to Mollie O'Brien, Head of Investor Relations. You may now begin. Mollie O'Brien: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Corie Barry, our CEO; and Matt Bilunas, our CFO. During the call today, we will be discussing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. I will now turn the call over to Corie. Corie Barry : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we are reporting better-than-expected Q1 profitability. Through strong execution, we continue to manage our profitability, while at the same time preparing for future growth. We progressed against our fiscal 2025 priorities, grew our paid membership base, implemented various restructuring actions and drove improvements in our relationship net promoter score and in our operational metrics for most of our prioritized customer experiences. The mix of macro factors continued to create a challenging sales environment for our category during the quarter, and our sales were slightly softer than our expectations. Our Q1 comparable sales declined 6.1% compared to last year, with the largest impacts coming from appliances, home theater, gaming, and phones. Services and laptops were areas of growth for the quarter. The Q1 digital sales mix was 31% of domestic sales, similar to last year. Our omnichannel fulfillment experience continues to improve with almost 60% of our packages delivered or available for pickup within one day, and 40% of our digital sales are picked-up in stores by our customers, with more than 90% of these orders available within just 30 minutes. From a profitability standpoint, our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.8% expanded 40 basis points compared to last year. This was above our expectations due largely to gross profit rate improvement in our membership and services offers. Customers remained very deal-focused, and attracted to more predictable sales moments. Our Q1 product margins were relatively stable even though the environment overall was more promotional than our expectations, in terms of both breadth and depth of promotions. We did see variability by category. For example, the major appliances category was materially more promotional in pursuit of stimulating interest and sales. As has been our practice, we were targeted and thoughtful regarding where and when we made our promotional investments. Throughout the quarter, our teams were driven and diligent, and I continue to be proud of their performance. I believe it is a testament to our strong culture that our people remain engaged, motivated and passionate about technology and serving our customers while navigating what has been an extended period of dampened demand. Our Q1 retail turnover trended down versus last year and remains lower than industry averages and our recent employee engagement survey shows our people have strong levels of connection, engagement and belonging that are at or above the global benchmark. As we look to the rest of the year, we are focused on our strategic plan and priorities, while being mindful about the state of the consumer. In February, we said we expect 2024 to be a year of increasing industry stabilization, and we continue to believe that. That being said, clearly, macro factors continue to fluctuate and put pressure on consumer spending. Three months ago, there were several indicators showing some favorability, including decreasing inflation, continued low unemployment, encouraging trends in consumer confidence and the beginnings of a housing market rebound. Since then, inflation is still high, mortgage rates are high and consumer confidence scores are trending lower. Consumers continue to make tough choices with their budgets, trading down in some areas, while still prioritizing spend in others, like services and experiences like travel. This, in combination with the pull-forward of tech purchases into the early years of the pandemic and lower levels of material innovation has led to continued lower demand for higher ticket consumer electronics and a focus on value and deals for current purchasers. We are not changing our original full-year guidance as it is early in the year. The first quarter is a relatively quiet quarter and we have yet to see the impact of a variety of coming new product launches and innovations. However, at this point in time, it is likely we are trending toward the midpoint of our original comparable sales guidance of flat-to-down 3%. We are strategically operating our business, balancing our response to the pressured sales environment. Therefore, even at the midpoint of the comparable sales guidance, we expect to deliver profitability toward the high end of our non-GAAP operating income rate guidance. At the same time, we are taking action and investing to sharpen our customer experiences and industry positioning. We know more of our key categories will return to growth. And historically, we outperform when there is more technology innovation and we leverage our competitive differentiation to provide the best experience for customers. From a major category standpoint, we continue to expect sales in our computing category to show growth for the full year. We expect revenue for the rest of our product categories as a whole to be down, partially offset by growth of our services revenue. As we plan for the next three quarters, we expect our comparable sales performance to sequentially improve. For the second quarter specifically, we expect comparable sales to decline approximately 3% compared to the 6% decline we saw in Q1. Based on month-to-date sales and results, our estimated comparable sales for May are expected to be better than our Q2 guidance. We are encouraged by these results, but from a timing perspective, we don't fully lap last year's Memorial Day sales until our June fiscal week one, and we continue to be very thoughtful about the time periods between sales events. Let's talk about computing and the exciting things happening there. We expect the category to benefit as early replacement and upgrade cycles gain momentum, and new products featuring even more AI capabilities are released as we move through the year. We have seen early signs of improvement as year-over-year comparable sales for laptops turned slightly positive in the fourth quarter and that trend continued in Q1. Last week, Microsoft announced Copilot Plus and laptops from Microsoft, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung are available for pre-order on our website right now and will be available on June 18. These devices have faster speed, better battery life, greater efficiency, they are much cooler, and baseline Copilot features like summarization that can quickly recap pages of documents or lengthy email threads. They also have exciting new use cases. For example, there is a recall function that makes it very easy to find documents based on visual queues or help users easily navigate back to a website to find a specific item they shopped for three weeks ago. They also have a live language translation function that works real-time on videos without requiring a connection to the Internet. And the co-create capability can take your rough sketches and turn them into works of art. To support these launches, we have built a comprehensive go-to-market plan. At roughly 40 SKUs in total, we expect to have the largest assortment at launch with more than 40% of the assortment retail exclusive to Best Buy. Working in coordination with our vendor partners, we will have inspirational merchandising and demos of the products in our stores, and unique educational and interconnected digital shopping journey. And, of course, we have an extensive training program to ensure we leverage our sales associates and Geek [Squadians] (ph) to ensure Best Buy is the destination for unbiased advice and inspiration around how this new tech can enrich their lives. There is additional innovation to drive excitement and interest, including the recently launched Apple iPads featuring their M4 chips that are already contributing to improved sales trends this quarter. Additionally, we have the new Bose open-ear headphones and [Sodos] (ph) has just announced they are entering the headphone space as well. All these launches are coming just in time for back-to-school, and we expect this drivetime to be an important part of the computing story. From July through mid-September, we will have a series of sales events focused on students and their parents that will feature our new brand positioning. We also plan to offer specific deals to our members to drive acquisition and engagement. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking action to sharpen our customer experiences and industry positioning, while also maintaining our profitability in this environment. Last quarter, we laid out our fiscal 2025 priorities. They are : one, invigorate and progress targeted customer experiences; two, drive operational effectiveness and efficiency; three, continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation; and four, explore, pilot and drive incremental revenue stream. I would like to provide some updates on our progress. We are focused on providing increasingly personalized, highly relevant, and motivational content, as we can attribute roughly 90% of our annual revenue to known customers. I'm particularly excited about the work we are doing with our app as we grow the number of users. Customers who use our app spend more than non-app users. During Q1, we went live with a personalized home screen powered by AI that is now rolled out to 50% of our app users. Each of these users' home screens look different based on their personal preferences, and a number of other factors like current location, shopping history, membership status, and what we know they care about the most based on their activity. This could include the newest and hottest deals, latest gadgets from favorite brands, recommendations on products, services, or accessories, or even a prompt to shop with one of our experts to help them save time. Thus far, customers who receive our personalized homepage are engaging at higher rates than we expected, and we are excited to roll the new features to all app users this summer. Over the past year, we've also been focused on driving speed improvements on the product pages and in checkout in the mobile experience to drive customer experience and sales performance. For example, since starting this work in February, we have driven a 50% reduction in mobile product detail page load time. Of course, we are also focused on the customer experience in our stores. From a physical standpoint, we plan to touch every store in the chain in some fashion throughout Q2 and Q3, improving both our merchandising and ease of shopping for customers. This includes improving and livening the merchandising presentation given the shift to digital shopping and corresponding lower need to hold as much inventory on the sales floor. It also includes rightsizing a number of categories to ensure we are leveraging the space in the center of our stores in the most exciting, relevant, and efficient way possible. For example, we will be removing physical media and updating our mobile, digital imaging, computing, tablets, and smart home departments. We are excited to partner even more with our vendors this year, as it relates to their branded in-store merchandise experiences. Of course, we will see updates in the computing department as we already discussed. We will also see new and enhanced in-store experiences for others, including GoPro, Tesla, Lovesac, and STARLINK. As we mentioned on our last call, we plan to close 10 to 15 stores per our ongoing review process, while opening a few new stores to test concepts. For example, in Kansas City, we are replacing a large store with a small format store close by to maximize store retention through convenience. Also later this year to capture untapped share, we are opening a store in an outstate area where we have no prior physical presence, and our omnichannel sales penetration is currently low. We want to ensure our customers receive the expert service interactions they want and Best Buy is known for it, when they come to our stores. Extensive training is imperative to that experience. For example, as we prepare for the new launches in computing, we have and will continue to partner with our vendors to train and certify thousands of computing experts in Geek Squad AI pros. In addition, this month, we added fully dedicated labor expertise to our in-store computing experience in hundreds of stores. We plan to add back fully dedicated expertise in major appliances and home theater departments in-stores this summer. These changes are in addition to the actions taken throughout the past year to streamline our leadership model, allowing us to invest in materially more customer-facing sales associate hours in our stores compared to last year. We also continue to partner with our vendors around expert labor. In fact, we have just expanded our vendor partnership with Samsung to include vendor-provided expert labor in appliance departments across hundreds of stores. This appliance labor will be incremental to our own existing labor plans. We are making good progress against our second key priority to drive operational effectiveness and efficiency. Our long-standing commitment to identifying cost reductions and driving efficiencies is paramount to help offset inflationary pressures in our business and fund investment capacity. Our fiscal 2025 initiatives are focused on driving further efficiencies across forward and reverse supply chain, our Geek Squad repair operations, and our customer care experience. For example, in [supply chain] (ph) we made enhancements to our systems and process guidelines that reduced TV damage in Q1, and we expect the savings to build throughout the year. We also developed a statistical model to identify high-return rate products that we leveraged with our major appliance vendors to reduce open-box products in the quarter. We will continue to lean heavily on analytics and technology to achieve these efficiencies. We have already shared how we are leveraging AI throughout 95% of our in-home delivery and installation trucks to drive more efficient scheduling and a better customer experience, and how we have begun using AI tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of our customer service calls. During Q1, we announced a partnership with Google Cloud and Accenture to help us further improve the customer and employee experiences in a seamless and human way. Expected to launch late this summer, our enhanced self-service support will leverage a GenAI powered virtual assistant to help our customers quickly troubleshoot product issues, make changes to their order delivery and scheduling, and even manage their software Geek Squad subscriptions and membership. This year, we are also taking larger actions to : one, ensure our resources are directed at the right strategic areas; and two, to right size our model, based on current operations. While we made most of these decisions and booked the associated restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, we are implementing most of the actions in the first half of the year with some not being implemented until fiscal 2026. These actions will allow us to do the following : balance field labor resources to make sure we are providing the optimal experience for customers where they want to shop; redirect corporate resources to make sure we have the necessary assets dedicated to areas like AI and other elements of our strategy; and right size parts of the business where we expect to see lower-volume than we envisioned a few years ago, whether that is the result of lower industry sales or due to decisions we made like evolving our paid membership benefits. For example, last year, we made the decision to remove free installation services from our membership program. This, as expected, led to reduced services fulfillment volume. As a result, during the first quarter, we reduced the number of Geek Squad team members to align our headcount to our forecasted demand. This will improve the experience for our remaining employees, and allow them to rely on a more consistent schedule and pay. Our third key priority for the year is to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation in this environment. We now expect our enterprise capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 to be approximately $750 million, $50 million lower than last year. This decline is largely due to our decision to concentrate our store capital investments more on existing store updates and refreshes and less on major remodels. Our share repurchases are expected to be similar to last year at approximately $350 million. Our annual dividend expense is expected to be approximately $800 million with our current dividend yield over 5%. As mentioned last quarter, our fourth key priority for fiscal 2025 is longer-term in focus. We will continue to explore opportunities that leverage our scale and capabilities to drive incremental profitable revenue streams overtime. This includes endeavors like our Best Buy Health business, our collaboration with Bell Canada to operate 165 small format consumer electronics retail stores across Canada, our Geek Squad as a service pilots and our supply chain partner plus program. It also includes continuing to build out our Best Buy Ads capabilities. We have had a robust retail media network business for a long time in partnership with our vendors, and we are expanding our available ad products and improving the advertiser user experience. For example, we recently announced a collaboration with CNET to share inventory across both ad platforms, [adding] (ph) reach and frequency for our brand advertisers along with closed-loop reporting. In addition, customers will see curated content and editorial advice from CNET's experts across various Best Buy channels encompassing a variety of product reviews and expert picks that align with their shopping experiences. We also rolled out new self-service reporting capabilities to all vendor ad partners. This will make it even easier for ad customers to engage with us and will provide valuable closed-loop insights on the effectiveness of on-site ad products. Before I close and turn the call over to Matt, I want to take a moment to recognize our employees for their continued work to support the communities we serve. I'm proud to share that we recently opened up two new Best Buy Teen Tech Centers in Los Angeles and Saint Cloud, Minnesota, and have several more set to open later this year. These centers join the Best Buy Foundation's growing network of youth-centered community hubs, where teens have access to the latest technology, learn real-world career skills, and interact with supportive mentors. We continue to be recognized as an industry-leader in sustainability. For the 11th year in a row, we were named as an Energy Star Partner of the Year. This award reflects our ongoing commitment to help our customers reduce their carbon emissions from Energy Star products. And during Earth Month, we partnered with Microsoft and Junk Kouture to help raise awareness about the importance of responsibly recycling old tech. In summary, we executed well in the first quarter, and remain focused on our fiscal 2025 priorities. The stickiness of certain macro factors and the ensuing impact on consumer demand for our category has been uneven, but we remain undeterred. We will continue to navigate the environment as we have the last few years, while remaining focused and energized about our purpose to enrich lives through technology. There is a lot of time left in year with exciting new innovations. We hold roughly one-third of the US retail sales market share in both computing and televisions, and we intend to strengthen our position in key categories like computing, home theater, and major appliances through elevated experiences, pointed marketing spend, and sharp pricing. We are the largest CE specialty retailer with the unique range of product assortment and expert services to help humanize tech for every stage of our customer's lives. We believe we are putting ourselves in the best position for fiscal 2025 and beyond. As our industry returns to growth, we expect to grow our sales and expand our operating income rate. I will now turn the call over to Matt for more details on Q1 financial performance and our outlook. Matt Bilunas : Good morning, everyone. Let me start by sharing a few details on our first quarter results. Enterprise revenue of $8.8 billion declined 6.1% on a comparable basis. Our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.8% improved 40 basis points compared to last year and included a 60 basis point improvement in our gross profit rate. Non-GAAP SG&A dollars were $97 million, lower than last year and increased approximately 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.20. Our comparable sales decreased 4.5% in February and decreased approximately 7% in both March and April. As a reminder, our comparable sales are computed on a like-for-like fiscal weeks and are not shifted to more closely aligned calendar weeks following last year's 53rd year -- for a 53rd week year. Although our sales were softer than we had planned, our non-GAAP operating income rate of 3.8% was 40 basis points higher than expected. Our gross profit rate was higher than expected, primarily due to a more favorable gross profit rate in our services category, which includes our membership offerings. Our non-GAAP SG&A expense was also favorable to our expectations, which was driven by lower store payroll and advertising expense. Next, I will walk through the details on our first quarter results compared to last year. In our domestic segment, revenue decreased 6.8% to $8.2 billion, driven by a comparable sales decline of 6.3%. From an organic perspective, the overall blended average selling price or ASPs of our products was higher than last year. The growth was entirely due to an increased mix of units from higher ticket items such as laptops and TVs, even though the individual ASPs for both categories were down to last year. International revenue of $644 million decreased 3.3%. Our domestic gross profit rate increased 80 basis points to 23.4% . The higher gross profit rate was primarily driven by improvements within our services category, which includes our membership offerings. This was partially offset by lower product margin rates and lower credit card profit-sharing revenue, consistent with the previous two quarters, approximately $20 million of vendor funding qualified to be recognized as an offset to SG&A, which was a reduction to cost-of-sales last year. We anticipate similar recognition of this funding in the second quarter of approximately $20 million and beginning in the third quarter of this year, we fully lap the recognition change. Our international gross profit rate decreased 90 basis points to 22.8%. The lower gross profit rate was primarily driven by lower product margin rates. Moving to SG&A, our domestic non-GAAP SG&A decreased $98 million, which was driven by : one, lower employee compensation expense, which was primarily store payroll; two, reduced vehicle rental costs; and three, lower expenses across multiple other areas, such as advertising and credit card fees. These decreases were partially offset by higher technology expense. During the first quarter, we returned $252 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Moving on to our full-year of fiscal 2025 financial guidance, which remains unchanged from the start of the year and is the following : Enterprise revenue in the range of $41.3 billion to $42.6 billion; enterprise comparable sales of down 3% to flat; enterprise non-GAAP operating income rate in the range of 3.9% to 4.1%; and a non-GAAP effective income tax rate of approximately 25%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5.75 to $6.20. As Corie mentioned, we now believe revenue is trending more towards the midpoint of our annual guidance range, whereas profitability more closely aligns with the high-end of our non-GAAP operating income rate guidance. This is due to our expectation for further gross profit rate improvement. We now believe our gross profit rate compared to fiscal 2024 will slightly exceed our original outlook of 20 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion. There are two key areas that have changed since the start of the year, which are the following : First, the continued profitability improvement of our services membership offering is now expected to provide more than 45 basis points of gross profit rate expansion we expected at the beginning of the year. This is primarily due to a lower cost to serve due to lower expected volume for in-home installation and other related services; Second, we now are expecting additional pressure on our product margin rate for the year, which is primarily driven by pricing investments. As I mentioned, the net impact of these two items is expected to result in gross profit rate improvement compared to our original guidance. The other gross profit rate drivers of our annual guidance remain unchanged from last quarter and they are the following : We still expect Best Buy Health to add a benefit of approximately 10 basis points to our enterprise gross profit rate on a year-over-year basis. We still expect approximately 20 basis points of pressure from a lower profit share on our credit card arrangement. The expected pressure in fiscal 2025 is primarily due to an expected increase in net credit losses. This estimate does not include potential implications from the proposed late fee regulation changes. Now, moving to our annual SG&A expectations, which remain unchanged from the start of the year. The high-end of our guidance assumes SG&A dollars are similar to fiscal 2024, which includes the following puts and takes. We expect higher incentive compensation as we reset our performance targets for the new year with the high-end of our guidance assuming an increase of $40 million compared to fiscal 2024. We still expect advertising expense to increase by approximately $15 million. Partially offsetting the previous items is the benefit of one less week, which is estimated at $90 million. Store payroll expense is expected to be approximately flat to fiscal 2024 as a percentage of sales. Lastly, the low end of our guidance reflects our plans to further reduce our variable expenses, which includes incentive compensation to align with the sales trends. Before I close, let me share a couple of comments specific to the second quarter. As Corie mentioned, we anticipate that our second quarter comparable sales will decline by approximately 3%. We expect our non-GAAP operating income rate to be approximately 3.5% or 30 basis points lower than the prior year comparable period. The lower year-over-year operating income rate is driven by SG&A deleverage as SG&A dollars are expected to be very similar to fiscal 2024 second quarter. I will now turn the call over to the operators for questions. Operator : We are now opening the floor for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Christopher Horvers from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Christopher Horvers from J.P. Morgan. Again, your line is now open. Apologies about that. Moving onto the next question. Our next question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is [indiscernible] for Steven Forbes. I know you touched on the newness this year, but maybe if you can give us a little more detail on the product roadmap post Labor Day? And if you could maybe remind us of annual revenues that come from some of these newer products? I had a quick follow-up on appliance market share. Any insights you can give and where are the merger market is trending and how your performance is relative to that? And if you see any visibility to that flipping? Thank you. Corie Barry : Maybe I'll start on some of the product roadmap side of things and then Matt can maybe move into some of the market share. On the product roadmap, we've got a few things right now that are happening. We had a kind of new suite of iPads that came out in about the middle of May here. Those are available for purchase now and we're already starting to see some of that new innovation contribute to what's been a bit of a change in trajectory on the growth rate even as we have been in May here. And then obviously, as we noted in the prepared remarks, Microsoft has announced a line -- a full-line of Copilot Plus products. As we said, that's 40 SKUs, about 40% of which are exclusive to Best Buy. Those are available for pre-order, but don't actually get delivered until June 18. And then we talked about a few of the others that have been announced that will at various stages within the next, call it, one month, be ready for purchase, which are some of the new open-ear headphones from Bose, and some of the new Google Chromecast notebooks that we're also seeing that have some AI-enabled features as well. So all of these kind of -- those we can see right now on the roadmap, likely some other products coming out as we continue into the back-to-school kind of timeframe. Most of that you're going to see flow-through and all of it, you're going to see flow-through that kind of computing area for us. One thing that I would note actually as well is that, the iPads that came out and the Pro side are incredibly powerful and are actually really close to the laptop side of the business as well. So we're watching customers kind of choose between all those things as they think about how they want to maximize their productivity go forward. So you're going to see a lot of that hit here in the kind of middle of Q2 and really becomes relevant, I think, mostly as we head into back-to-school. And like I said, it's part of that larger computing category that you can see us break out. Matt Bilunas : Sure. And in terms of appliances, I think if I just step back appliances is a great category for us. I think Q1 specifically, you saw an appliance category that was a materially more promotional in pursuit of stimulating interest and sales within the industry and has been our practice. We are very targeted and thoughtful about when and where to make our promotional investments. So in Q1, I think if we looked at it, we probably did lose share in Q1. It was a very promotional category in Q1. Q1 is somewhat quiet quarter for us. April is the smallest quarter in the month. I think the industry is also shifting towards a duress type of purchase of single-item purchase, non-premium package purchases, which hasn't historically been our biggest part of the category. So still feel really good about the category in total. I think where you'll also see us as we look into Q2, Q3, and Q4, you're seeing in our comments that we are now investing in pricing and marketing, and labor in the future to help support that category, which seems more appropriate for the rest of this year versus what we saw happening in Q1. So still feel great about the appliance category in total and are positioning ourselves well as we look out to the remaining part of the year. Corie Barry : And the last thing I would say, just to add-on, I think we're very targeted in the drive times and we talked about the trend in May improving, and a part of what drove some of that trend improvement was an improvement in this particular part of the business where we made some targeted moves as it relates to the bigger drive time of Memorial Day. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Simeon Gutman : Hey, good morning, everyone. Connected to appliances, you mentioned, I think Corie was quoted in the press release talking about the strengthening your positioning in certain places, and you mentioned pricing on appliances. So can you talk about where the position or I don't know if its market share has weakened. Can you talk about why? And then you mentioned pricing in terms of appliances. Are you using pricing anyplace else? And is it because the industry got more promotional and then I guess, how far do you have to move on price? I guess it's all back into the guidance, but what's the risk that this pricing keeps getting, I guess, more promotional as the year goes on? Corie Barry : I think if we think about the promotional environment, and I said it in the prepared remarks, it's definitely higher in aggregate than what we saw last year, and even our own expectations. And that's both breadth and depth. And I think that reflects the consumer who we've said is very value-oriented. You said it yourself, I would reinforce implied in the guide is our planned investments to continue to strengthen our positioning in key areas. Now we're going to do it in our own way, right? We're going to do this partially with some of the specialized labor, partially with some vendor specialized labor that we talked about, partially with marketing and we had talked a little bit more about spending more in marketing year-over-year, that was included in the guy, and then, of course, partially in pricing. But I think what you've seen us do and there have been a lot of questions out there -- I've seen in various calls, where people are asking, is it about the revenue or is it about the profit? And my team hates me because I only use one word, and that is, and. And so, I think the team is constantly navigating, when in the right times can we get the best eyeballs, those bigger drive times, that's not going to be in a month like April, that's going to be in places like Memorial Day or the 4th of July. And then how do we use the suite of assets that we have at Best Buy, including installation and delivery and membership to help deliver the best value in a way that balances the outcomes as best we can. Simeon Gutman : Fair enough. Can I ask maybe one follow-up to exactly the word you said the, and. The business is being managed incredibly well. It's very efficient right now. And you said it yourself, you're going to be adding some expenses back in the second half as the industry turns. Thinking about the operating leverage on the turn, is there a scenario where you get both the and, you get the typical Best Buy operating leverage when the cycle turns or do you have to spend back into it, given how efficient the business is today? Matt Bilunas : Yes. I mean, I think without guiding next year, I think as we start to see our business improve, see the industry improve and our sales grow along with the industry growth as well. We would expect along with that growth, we would be able to manage our business in a way to continue to get operating rate expansion as we look-forward. Now exactly what quarter and does it show-up exactly perfectly. I think overall we're going to manage our business to increasingly improve our efficiency as well as grow our sales and we'll do that through the means of making the right investments in our business, still continuing to drive efficiency in our business where we see it and also making sure that our initiatives are progressing in the way that also help bolster our profitability as we look-forward. Simeon Gutman : Thank you. Okay. Good luck. Corie Barry : Thank you. Matt Bilunas : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Peter Keith from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Peter Keith : Hey, thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask about the AI-enabled laptop. Certainly, seems kind of exciting. What's the pre-order interest right now? And also, Corie, what do you think about the $1,000 plus price points? Do you think that's a little high right now to drive mass adoption? Corie Barry : So in terms of pre-orders, let me start by saying, to your point exactly, this price point does not usually represent a huge amount of pre-orders. It tends to be something people want to come in and see, or want to spend a little bit of time researching. That being said, already the preorders are outpacing, I'd call it, our early expectations just a bit, not massively, but just a bit. So that's good. What we're looking for here is early indicators that there is at least interest in learning more. And I think where we're really working hard, as I talked about all the investments we're making is really helping the consumer understand what is the value that I get here. And that's why we started with some of the descriptors like longer battery life -- materially longer battery life or it just runs cooler and your fans not going on all the time. Like these are actually consumer attributes that people find interesting. You're right, it is more premium computing at this point as are the new iPads and iPad Pros that just came out in the middle of the month, which we saw pretty much immediately stimulate some really interesting demand, Peter. So I wouldn't call this -- and we've been pretty clear on this from day one. This is not -- everyone is lined up at the front door waiting to run in and grab the new computer, but it is enough, like most things in CE, where it starts a little bit more premium, has some of the attributes, drives some of the interest, and allows us the chance to partner with our vendors to really think differently about how we go to market with a new generation of computing. And then again in a timeframe that's, let's call it about four and a half years post-pandemic and should be a very ripe timeframe for replacing almost a generation of computing and that probably is nearing at the end of its life cycle. Peter Keith : Okay. Sounds good. Certainly some innovation is better than where we've been. Maybe just sticking on the AI theme. As you're incorporating AI capabilities into your own business, it sounds like it's more focused on the customer support experience. So the heart of the question is, do you think that drives both a better experience and cost savings or do you prioritize one versus the other, if there are cost-savings any way to kind of frame that up for us? Corie Barry : This is another and topic. We highlighted one example. It's hard because we can't highlight every single example in the script. But I really think about there's kind of four buckets as we think about using AI in our business. One is more what I would call on the strategic offense. That is more about how do we -- we talked about knowing 90% of our customers when they come to us. That personalized homepage in the app is an exceptional example of how we're using AI in a way that is all geared around the customer experience. And we can easily see in the data that our customers are engaging with us substantially more when they have that personalized experience. One other simple example, if you go out right now and you look at our customer reviews, you will see themes of customer reviews and then you can refine those reviews based on a theme you want to learn more about, meaning someone might complain because the battery life isn't long enough. You can then filter quickly to see all of the reviews based on that. That is all AI-enabled, that is all about customer experience. And we know when people interact with reviews, they are much more likely to follow that transaction all the way through. So there is a lot that is on just the flat out customer experience side of things that will drive incremental engagement and ultimately revenue. Then yes, we also highlighted the expense reduction side of things. But you asked -- I love how you asked the question because it started with, and I will use our call center example. It started with an experience that we felt was suboptimal for both customers and employees. And it started with a complete journey and we could show you the entire journey we're trying to create for our customers that will vastly improve their experience. And then AI and generative AI is a tool that we are plugging into that experience in certain places, so that it can be more efficient. An example there is that, we've talked about this before, our agents don't need to summarize calls now. Those calls are automatically summarized, which means the agent can concentrate a lot more on the person they're talking to. It's also a quicker transaction, and it helps with that end-to-end customer experience all the way through. And yes, at the end-of-the day, that is allowing us to be more efficient and double down on using that agent's time most effectively, which was with the customer who wants a problem solved. And then finally, we're also working on making sure we're doing this in a responsible way, and that we are very clear about our customer's data, and then all of us just are continuing our kind of usage here of these tools. So we're trying to highlight different examples, all of it in service of a customer and employee strategy. Peter Keith : Okay. Thank you very much and good luck. Corie Barry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Robert Ohmes : Hey, Corie, actually two questions. One is just, I wanted to get a clarification on the May to date comps. The -- can you just remind us what -- explain the impact of the Memorial Day shift is? Are you running above the minus 3, if you exclude the benefit of Memorial Day May to date or I just wanted to clarify on that? And then I had a follow-up question. Corie Barry : Yes, I'll start with that. So what we said precisely is based on the month-to-date results, the estimated comparable sales for May right now are better than the Q2 guide. We -- that doesn't include a full lap of Memorial Day. It's tricky because the Memorial Day weekend falls like half in May fiscal and half in June fiscal. So it includes a chunk of it, not quite all of it. All that being said, it's still -- even if we try to do all the adjustments, all put together, you're still, if not right in line with the guide, maybe just a little bit better. So you're right in there even with the chips. As best can tell. So I will couch that. I would want to say though just since we're on the topic, we're also thoughtful about those periods between those main drive times. So that's a bit of why we see maybe the guide for the quarter, there'll be some puts and takes in there. But we're liking at least what we're seeing in some of the drive times and in some of the innovation, because where the trend really changed from what we were seeing in April is two main places. One, we saw a trend change in tablets. So as we saw both the new launches, the Pro and the new Air, as well as some of the deals on the older generations, because I think sometimes what people forget is sometimes when you get the new innovation, it allows you to cycle through some of the older [indiscernible] product as well. So you get that broad set of price points that makes it accessible for everyone. Tablets in general was better. And then the second, back to our point that we made about using these key drive times, both major appliances and TVs started seeing some initial positive impacts from some of the intentionality that we're putting into those categories. So, what we like is that, even as we continue to go through the lapping question, the overall change in trajectory kind of underscores the thesis that we've been talking about now for some time. Robert Ohmes : Thank you. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. Can you remind us the advantages of doing more refreshes versus store remodels? Corie Barry : Yes, there are a few. So if you think about a full-on remodel, typically there, you're going to take one store and top-to-bottom, you're going to move the walls, do all the things. It is a capital-intensive process. It does definitely result at the end of the day in a lovely store experience, but you are more limited in the quantity of stores that you can do because it requires obviously a little bit more capital-intensive process. And the way we're looking at it this year is the store updates allow us and refreshes allow us to touch every single store in the chain. So instead of remodeling 30, we get the chance to go touch 900. And we gave some examples within the script, where we're going to rightsize some of the categories. We're going to make sure the center of the store is exciting, relevant. We're going to make sure that for some of these new product launches, you're going to see really interesting displays. But importantly, it also gives us a more scaled chance to work with our vendors on their experiences in our stores, because if we're going to go touch all the stores anyway, we get the chance then to partner with our vendors on where they might also want to update some of their store experiences. So you almost get a little bit more reach, not because it's not just us doing it, we get the chance to go into those stores and maybe refresh our experiences as well as some of those vendor experiences. And so I think the advantage is, you get a chance more at-scale to be able to kind of do a refresh and in tandem with some of the innovation that we're talking about. Robert Ohmes : Got it. Really helpful. Thank you. Corie Barry : Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Horvers from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open Chris Horvers : Thanks. And thanks for putting me back in, some tech problems here at J.P. Morgan. So my first question is, can you talk about the unit trend momentum sequentially from the fourth quarter to the first quarter in computing and TVs. And presumably, you have a good view of what ASPs could look like in those categories just as you think about the rest of the year, and acknowledging the prior question that talked about some high price points, but you know, was there any deterioration in new trends? And should the ASPs actually just net-net accelerate and not dampen that unit demand? Matt Bilunas : Yes, overall, I think we've been seeing similar type of units as we progress through Q4 to Q1, and you get into Q2, I think probably nothing too dissimilar there. I think we are seeing the potential for ASP improvements as you look towards the back half of the year with this innovation that's coming, and typically with process -- when you transition your product from the old to the new, you carry on a higher ASP, then it's even higher than the old product. The old product goes down in price and the net of it is either the same, if not typically higher. And I think these new AI capabilities are going to probably drive a level of innovation and excitement in product features that are going to continue to probably push ASPs a little bit. Now, again, it's only in part of our computing category. We're really talking about laptops right now. AI hasn't necessarily filtered its way into desktops in some other areas. So still potential as you look beyond this year. Chris Horvers : And then just to clarify that. And then on, I guess on the home theater side, were TV units positive? And then as my follow-up question is really on the services growth. I mean, I believe it comp like 9% here in the first quarter. So I guess how much of that is what's changing there? Is it renewal rates, is it attach rates? Is it changes that you made to the program that's driving that growth? Any detail there would be great. Thanks very much. Matt Bilunas : Sure. No, on the TV side, both units and ASPs were both down. So I'm not seeing the unit growth there on the TV side again. Where TVs is a very low price point, low-tier type of environment. And so we're obviously navigating the overall part of that industry. And as we -- the second part of the question was services, the service growth was driven by charging for installation services that were previously part of the membership program. So back in June of last year, we removed installation as part of the free membership offering and started charging for that service going forward. And so that's what's driving most of that services revenue growth. There's also a little bit of growth coming from standalone warranty that's improved this year compared to last year. Chris Horvers : Got it. Thanks very much. Matt Bilunas : You bet. Operator : And the next question comes from Anthony Chukumba from Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Anthony Chukumba : Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Pretty quick one. In terms of the store refreshes, a two-part question, I guess, how quickly can you execute those? And then what's the and I know it's built into your $750 million CapEx guidance, but what's the sort of rough cost on them? I know they're obviously a lot cheaper than a full refresh, but would just love to get some perspective on that? Thanks. Corie Barry : Absolutely. I can start with the how fast question. We said in the prepared remarks, we're going to be doing this throughout Q2 and Q3. So you're going to see us pretty quickly here start to move and obviously, a piece that needs to go right away is the computing presentation and how we're making some updates to the computing of the store. So you're going to see these roll throughout Q2 and Q3 with the objective being as set as possible as we head into holiday. The team does a really nice job being able to move through these. There's probably one other advantage of doing more a refresh model is, you can do these overnight. You can get in, get it refreshed and get out, get it ready. Matt Bilunas : Yeah from a cost perspective, we've never really given the total. I mean, from a remodel, you're talking, sometimes a couple of million dollars. In some cases, if you're looking at a refresh and ranges depending on what you want to do, it could be $50,000 up to a few hundred thousand dollars. I would add that our partners also participate in some of these remodels because we're changing some of their own -- their presentation, which they like to see, their product presentation change, when we make these store changes. So it really depends on the store and what you're changing in terms of the scope of any individual store, but it's significantly less than a new store build. Corie Barry : And Anthony, just to rip on it just a little bit, there's a bunch of things that kind of work in concert here over the next couple of quarters. Innovation, that kind of drives us to want to highlight both vendor spaces and our own spaces in our stores. So you get the store refreshes. You're going to see us do a brand refresh here at Best Buy and we'll use some of that new branding as we head into back to school. That also brings through a little bit of refresh from a store perspective. We've talked about the dedicated labor zones that we're bringing into hundreds of stores. So you start to get the dedicated labor in appliances and home theater and computing, and we're augmenting that with incremental vendor labor that's new in a couple of spots. We used the Samsung Appliance example explicitly. And then we wrap around that some of the more personalized approaches to trade in or to membership. I think as you look into Q2 and Q3, we're kind of trying to bring all of this together in a way that both physically and digitally shows up as being kind of new and exciting for our customers and our employees. Anthony Chukumba : That's very helpful. Thank you. Corie Barry : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Seth Basham : Thanks a lot. My question is on the membership program. If you could provide some more insight into how that's growing on a paid basis and the key drivers of your better than expected margin performance from it, that would be helpful? Corie Barry : I'll start maybe on the topic on acquisition and Matt can talk a little bit about some of the drivers. We're not going to update the overall acquisition numbers every quarter. But as a reminder, we ended fiscal 2024 with 7 million members across the two tiers of paid membership, and that was compared to 5.8 million members at the start of the year. And if I take a big step back, our whole goal here is to drive customer engagement and increased share of wallet, all the more important in a world where people are a little less brand loyal than they were certainly pre-pandemic. And so there's like three things we're always watching. You hit on acquisition, but we're also always watching engagement and we're watching retention. And all of those then factor into kind of the financial outcomes that Matt will talk about. So we continue to grow our new customers in Q1 and add more to both tiers of membership. We still are seeing that paid members consistently are showing higher levels of interaction and comparatively higher levels of spend at Best Buy and the shift away from competitors, and it still is really early. We don't lap the rollout of particularly plus, but even the new revamp of Total until June. But even on the early renewals for Total, retention rates are outperforming some of our expectations. So I give the team a great deal of credit, both for kind of tweaking these offers in a way that resonated more with customers, but also for continuing to refine the way we reach out to those customers to make sure we optimize both their interactions and that resulting financials. Matt Bilunas : Sure. And just a reminder, as we started the year, we expected membership and services to improve our gross profit rate by 45 basis points. And now what we're saying, it's more than 40 -- it's a little bit more than 45 basis points. And so what we're seeing be a little bit better is essentially a little bit lower cost to serve come through in Q1, which we would expect to continue as the year progresses. That's what's driving it. Those are just lower volumes coming through some of our categories driving some improved profit rate. We're also actually seeing a little bit more standalone warranty sales, which is helping our overall membership/services gross profit rate for the year as well. Seth Basham : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jonathan Matuszewski from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Jonathan Matuszewski : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So on the spend across demographics, I imagine the initial debut of AI PCs may resonate with certain demographics until it becomes more mainstream, maybe a little bit higher income, maybe a little bit younger in age perhaps. So, are the spending trends for those customer cohorts outperforming the broader customer base? Corie Barry : Well, just to be explicit, we haven't launched the new AI PCs yet. They don't actually start shipping and getting out there until June 18th. So everything has been announced and there are pre-orders available, but we haven't had a chance yet to see what the impact will be. I think in general, the interesting part about this is because we're seeing innovation across both computing and tablets, I think it's going to create broad opportunity, because we hit on this just a little bit in one of the earlier questions. It's not just about the newest gen of product, which to your point might resonate to a certain cohort. It also sometimes makes the older generations of product more approachable because those tend to be at a different price point because now you have the new innovation and as Matt talked about, that's what kind of props up some of the higher ASPs. So I typically, it's not just about this will only resonate with one demographic, it's actually a question of how do you create that kind of good, better, best assortment that we're always creating, which then can make -- it might not be only the new stuff that someone gravitates to, but it might give them a better entry point, a more value-based entry point to that new refreshed product at least for them versus what they've had for the last four or five years. Jonathan Matuszewski : That's helpful. And my second question, just on discounting. So it sounds like promos were materially deeper in appliances. So just to be clear, I guess the midpoint of the 2024 comp guide, does that assume that the promo activity in that category stays stable as the year moves on? Does it embed any improvement or deterioration in discounting levels? Any more color there would be great? Thanks. Matt Bilunas : Yes, I think what our guide assumes is that, there's actually more promotionality for the remaining part of the year. In our prepared remarks, we talked about how -- where our product margin rates will be slightly lower than our expectations as we started the year that was driven by the expectation that will be more pricing investments because of the promotionality as the year progresses. Although that was included in our guide and still included in the fact that we still feel like the profit rate is trending towards the higher end of the original guide that we gave. But I'd say it's beyond just major appliances, that is certainly a category that's been very promotional. I would say there's also increased promotionality across other categories as well, notably TV is another place where I'd call out. Corie Barry : And I think that is our last question. Thank you all for joining us today. And I hope that many of our investors who might be listening today will be able to join us at our Annual Shareholder Meeting, which will be held virtually on June 12th. Thank you all and have a wonderful day. Operator : Thank you for attending today's call. We hope you have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",
