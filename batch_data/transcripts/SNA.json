Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc. Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated First Quarter Investor Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks, Sarah, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s first quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning and with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of the call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual I'll start today\u2019s call with the highlights of our quarter. I'll give you my perspective on the results, on our markets and on our progress. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. Our first quarter results were encouraging. They demonstrate clear progress along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our sales were up 6.2% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 100 basis points and the earnings per share increased 15.7% to $1.62. The organic sales increase was 5%.  Challenger Lifts, which you'll recall, we acquired in the second quarter last year, added another 15.2 million which along with an 80 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates brought our total sales for the quarter to 787.5 million.  The EPS rise included an opco operating margin expansion to 15.5%, up from 14.5% in 2013. Financial services operating income increased to 34.4 million from last year\u2019s 30.5, driving the consolidated numbers to -- operating margin to 18.6%, also up 100 basis points. Both the operating margin and the total margin were up 100 basis points. From a macroeconomic standpoint, our automotive repair related businesses, the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group, they\u2019ve enjoyed a reasonably favorable environment for quite some time. And I'd say there is no real change. Now RS&I overall organic activity was up only slightly. But that primarily reflects the wind down of a major OEM program rather than any real change in market dynamics. You\u2019ll also remember that C&I is where the majority of our headwinds have been concentrated. So that\u2019s an area where I think is worth more -- a more discussion is warranted. And as you can tell from the group's, 10.4% organic rise, there were encouraging gains backed by some evolution of the environment. In Europe, one of the big highlights of our fourth-quarter was the lessening of our headwinds. And in conjunction with that, the first upturn in sales we've seen in some time for our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe.  Encouragingly, our first quarter was up again. So that\u2019s a real positive. And SNA Europe is a solid contributor to C&I\u2019s current growth. But I would characterize the C&I performance this quarter less about market improvement and more about day-to-day business progression. For example, we did see some important advancement in our extension to critical industries. It\u2019s an area we've been focusing on, and it\u2019s paying off. At the same time, we\u2019ve moved past the most difficult comparisons related to the reduced military spending and that's allowing the European contributions in critical industry gains to shine through, without as much year-over-year military offset to mask the progress. So many of our markets remain strong and the headwind of Europe is abating. But headwinds do remain. The current situation in Eastern Europe does create an overhang and that did have an impact on our businesses.  And while the military comparisons are not as challenging, the absolute spending in that sector remains depressed without any near-term indication of a return to past levels. But generally at the end of the day, there will always be headwinds. And we do believe that, no matter the market environment, we're well-positioned to continue advancing down our four defined runways for growth enhancing the franchise channel, extending into the critical industries, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage and building in emerging markets.  And along with that progress, that advancement, we believe that the Snap-on value creation processes of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI will extend our positive performance trend and continue to drive us down our ample runways for improvement. And as I speak of the segment results, I\u2019ll highlight some of the advancements in both growth and in net improvement. Let\u2019s start with C&I. Sales in the quarter were up organically by 10.4%, the operating margin reached 13.5%, up significantly from last year\u2019s 11.5%. Related to those sales, there were gains in each of the group\u2019s operating units and as I already mentioned, one of the real highlights was a second consecutive quarter of growth for SNA Europe. We\u2019re starting to see a trend in Europe and we also saw a double digit rise in our industrial division where we have our primary focus on the spending to critical industries. And in that area, we had some big wins particularly in aviation. Also noteworthy in Asia was solid growth in important markets like India and the Philippines, much of that was driven by our expanding undercar equipment line-up that was made possible by the further significant ramp up of the production at our Kunshan plant. The C&I quarter saw benefits both from higher sales and from RCI. You can see it in the rise of the OI margin, up 200 basis points. Regarding the margins, SNA Europe deserves mention. Even before the volume started coming back late last year, that operation was contributing some noticeable profitability increases and that improvement continued again this quarter now amplified by the aid of volume.  As for the industrial division and the robust growth in that business, the activity this quarter with customers and then critical aerospace sector clearly demonstrates traction. That area has been a primary focus of our extension into critical industries and the results are showing through with some large win. I said for quite some time that there is a bit of learning curve in understanding the customers in critical industries with the same level of insight we have with automotive technicians. Now we are making progress with customer connection spending time in the work places, launching innovative new products based on those observations, for example -- and for example we\u2019re participating side by side at customer sites in RCI events and in safety training, becoming more familiar with the work, with the challenges and with the needs of our customers. You see RCI and safety are often directly related to making the work easier and safer with the right tool, and that\u2019s our business. Speaking to the right tool, I want to highlight a couple of new products that demonstrate customer connection and innovation applied to (south) [ph] critical test. We recently launched a new design of cutters called the cushion throat cutter. They were designed specifically for use in aviation where aero tools or material commonly referred to as foreign object damage, they can cause big problems in an engine. While we took our standard power edge cutters but added a feature that catches wire other material that was cut -- that other material that gets cut preventing it from flying off and causing troubles. This is a good example of job insight offering new tools and building our presence. In this case in the critical aviation sector a simple idea based on customer connection that makes a great difference. Oil and gas another area of focus and we have an expanding offering for applications in the oilfields, in power plants and in offshore rigs. Our visits to those sites recently highlighted the field technicians' struggle with making valve adjustments on the natural gas engines that are prevalent in that environment. As a result of that observation, we developed our new pass through socket to solve that particular problem creating just the special geometry that ends the struggle, another clear example of customer connection and innovation coming together to make work easier in a critical application. So that\u2019s a bit of colour on the C&I progress. Now on to tools, the tools group. Sales were up 6% organically, operating margin up 14.3% compared to 14.4% last year, including in the quarter 50 basis points of unfavourable currency impacts from our operations in Canada and Australia. Our organic growth for the past four years of 9%, 9.2%, 10.7% and 7.6%, certainly speaks to the improved position of the tools group. And the growth this quarter following on the heels of that kind of sustained trend demonstrates the success we\u2019ve had on this decisive runway for growth, enhancing the franchise channel. But the enhancement is not just about sales, we see the progress in many places in the metrics we track, in the low franchisee turnover, in the high enthusiasm, in the external validation by independent surveys of our franchisees, they all confirm substantial progress. Much of the strength we've seen could be tied to the great innovative new products that Snap-on has to offer when showing up every week at repair shops. Products like the MODIS Ultra handheld diagnostic unit, faster with a bigger full colour touch screen and our Fast-Track Expert information, it\u2019s launched last year in the U.S. it\u2019s been a big success and it\u2019s helping to drive big ticket volume. During this quarter, we brought the MODIS Ultra to the UK and to Australia, it\u2019s been well received in both markets and has contributed significantly to our international growth. Also speaking on new products and innovation, you might recall the S6810 Flip Socket, the MOTOR Magazine Top 20 award winning tool, we introduced last year. Sounds simple. A two sided socket, 8 millimeter and 10 millimeters on opposite sides, very common sizes on under body panel.  The new socket can be quickly flipped for convenience, and removing panels with only one tool. It\u2019s a real timesaver and as a consequence, a big success. We have taken that idea and expanded it to other common sizes, adding a 13 millimeter and 15 millimeter combo, and specifically for European mix a 9 millimeter and 11 millimeter combo. And for Asian model, a 12 millimeter and 14 millimeter combo were sold in a set to span a range of vehicles a technician is likely to see, and a design to be used what our Snap-on CT power tool series. That combination is now one of this year\u2019s hit.  When it comes to new product innovation, you think that there might not have been much opportunity in a product line like a ratchet. They\u2019ve been around a long time. But actually we've been growing in that category over an extended period based on customer connection, innovation and design capabilities. You see preferences differ greatly among technicians depending on the mix of vehicles they encounter and the pairs on which they focus. So we take an advantage of those varying needs by introducing multiple ratchet designs and features against the relatively standard offerings of our competitors. I\u2019ll mention one of those variations. Our quarter inch drive extended reach series, it incorporates an extra-long handle, we believe the longest quarter inch drive available anywhere. It reaches hard to access areas and allows a greater leverage. It also has a quick release mechanism for those who want speed and I am fortunate incorporates our Dual 80 technology for strength and durability, another hit product, innovation even in a fully established line like ratchet, finely related to the tools group and its growth. I want to mention our financial services segment. Aldo will speak of that area in some detail, but I just want to highlight the strategic importance of financial services at Snap-on, and how important it's been to the advancement, especially in those big ticket categories of diagnostics and tools storage. Those products has helped blaze the trail enhancing our franchisees and Snap-on credit continues to be an essential and strategic player in that progress. Let\u2019s move to RS&I. The results were encouraging, but not as straightforward as for the other groups. Overall sales were up 6.7%, the operating margin at 22.1% compared to 22% last year. We did have higher restructuring charges this year that reduced margins by about 60 basis points, and adding in the lower margin Challenger sales also had an impact. These two items more than offset, was in fact a reasonable profit expansion in RS&I authored by rapid continuous improvement.  The overall RS&I sales gain included 15.2 million of Challenger lifts with only a small organic increase, reflecting primarily the wind-down of some essential tool programs at the OEM dealerships which we discussed quite a bit last year, if you might remember. As many of you know the essential tool business does tend to be a bit lumpy, thus the tough comparison in the OEM space. I will say that in this year\u2019s first quarter, we also had some new programs. So we actually don\u2019t see the OEMs are pulling back.  This comparison just reflects the nature of this type of business and that lumpiness largely offsets the real progress with the diagnostics and repair information products we're selling into independent shop owners and managers. We have seen those increases with independents for some time and the gains continues in the first quarter. It\u2019s an encouraging picture. The combination of new handheld diagnostic units, repair information, the expert knowledge of Mitchell 1 SureTrack offering along with under car equipment line up of tire changes, imaging of liners and lifts, have established significant momentum with both individual and independent shops, and with a large multi-location repair chains. We have also broadened or medium and heavy duty product offering over the past years, adding specially aimed repair information and diagnostic units. And its paid off. We had a significant win in recognition recently in this heavy duty sector when our diagnostic information from Mitchell was integrated into Navistar\u2019s Oncommand Connection Remote Diagnostic and Fleet Management System. The combination is designed to increase vehicle uptime and provide improved fleet management efficiency. It will give more shops across to merit a greater access to the broad range of the Mitchell 1 features that make repairing all makes of commercial trucks, class IV through VIII easier with engine fault code diagnostics repair procedures, wiring diagrams, test steps and removal or installation instructions. It\u2019s a one clear example of building positions with garage owners and managers in the heavy-duty space. And that growing presence is driving new business with large organizations that run mixed fleet, car and truck, they need to support both vehicle types, and increasingly Snap-on has the answer. Because of that, we're seeing more fleet business with big companies, with utilities, and with governments both city and state.  Now the strength of the RS&I portfolio was also evident this past quarter at the National Automotive Dealer Association show, the NADA show in New Orleans earlier this year. Our operations came together under a tool shop solutions, a total shop solutions banner, it allows Snap-on to clearly demonstrate the depth and breadth of our offering to support OEM dealerships and the Challenger acquisition has been an important part of that depth, that portfolio. We believe that operation would be -- we believe when we acquired it, that that operation would be a fine addition to Snap-on and RS&I and that\u2019s certainly proven to be true. As evidenced, I\u2019ll just point to the lift that Challenger develops specifically for the quick service space that are becoming so common in OEM service centres. It\u2019s gotten some strong endorsements and it\u2019s another example of how we\u2019re able to expand the Snap-on presence with repair garage owners and managers. So to wrap up RS&I, we see new diagnostics and repair information for cars and trucks and a growing under car equipment line that now includes Challenger lifts, progress with independence with multi-location automotive repair chain and with the important medium and heavy duty segment; we see positive trends and improved position with repair shop owners and managers. So that\u2019s the highlight of our quarter, growth and improvement. Sales up 5% organically, overcoming the remaining headwinds. OI margins 15.5%, up 100 basis points. C&I strength with critical industry showing their potential, the tools group growing again continuing to enhance our franchise network with success. RS&I building its position and its product line with particular success and independent shops and financial services raising its contribution both financially and strategically. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo for a review of the financials. Aldo. Aldo Pagliari :  Thanks Nick. Our first quarter consolidated operating results, I summarized on Slide 6, net sales of $787.5 million in the quarter increased $45.8 million or 6.2% from 2013 levels reflecting sales gains across all segments. Organically, sales increased 5% excluding $15.2 million of sales from the Challenger Lifts acquisition and an unfavourable $5.9 million impact from foreign currency translation. The 5% organic sales increased primarily reflect sales gains in our businesses serving critical industries as well as those calling out automotive technicians and providing diagnostics and information products and independent repair shop owners and managers. Consolidated gross profit of $378.7 million increased $21.8 million from 2013 levels. The gross margin of 48.1% in the quarter was unchanged from prior year levels. As savings from on-going rapid continuous improvement or RCI, initiatives were largely offset by unfavourable foreign currency effects and the impact of lower margin Challenger products. Operating expenses of $257 million increased 7.9 million while the operating expense margin of 32.6% improved 100 basis points from 33.6% a year ago primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and the effects of the Challenger acquisition partially offset by inflationary and other cost increases. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $121.7 million in the quarter including $5.3 million or 60 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects increased to $13.9 million and as a percentage of sales, improved 100 basis points to 15.5%. Operating earnings from financial services of $34.4 million increased 12.8% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings of 156.1 million including $5.4 million or 60 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects increased 12.9% over 2013 levels and the operating margin of 18.6% improved 100 basis points from 17.6% a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 31.6% compared with 31.9% last year. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $95.9 million or $1.62 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $82.8 million or $1.40 per share last year, representing a 15.7% increase in earnings per share. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with the commercial and industrial or C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $290.6 million in the quarter were up 10.4% organically primarily due to sales gains the customers and critical industries as well as continued sales increases in our European based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group totalled $112.7 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38.8% improved 160 basis points over 2013 levels primarily due to benefits from higher sales, $2.1 million of lower restructuring cost and savings from on-going RCI initiatives. These gross margin improvements were partially offset by $4.1 million or 100 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $73.6 million in the quarter increased $5.2 million over 2013 levels primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 25.3% improved 40 basis points primarily reflecting benefits from sales volume leverage partially offset by inflationary and other cost increases. As a result of these factors, first quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $39.1 million including $3.3 million of unfavourable foreign currency effects, increased $8.5 million from 2013 levels and the operating margin of 13.5% improved 200 basis points from 11.5% last year. Turning now to slide eight, first quarter sales in the Snap-on tools group of $343.6 million increased 6% organically reflecting mid-single digit increases in both our U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $148 million increased 4.1 million from 2013 levels while the gross margin of 43.1% decreased 90 basis points from 44% last year, largely due to $2.9 million or 50 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects.  Operating expenses of 98.8 million in the quarter increased $2.1 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 28.8% improved to 80 basis points from 29.6% last year reflecting benefits from sales volume leverage partially offset by inflationary and other cost increases. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $49.2 million for the Snap-on tools group including 2.1 million or 50 basis points of unfavourable foreign currency effects, increased $2 million from prior year levels the operating margin of 14.3% compared with 14.4% last year. Turning to the repair systems and information or RS&I Group showed on slide nine. Sales of $262.7 million increased 16.6 million or 6.7% from 2013 levels excluding 15.2 million of acquisition related Challenger sales and 0.7 million of favourable foreign currency translations. Organic sales were up slightly as gains in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to repair shop owners and managers were largely offset by lower sales to OEM dealerships including the wind down of an essential diagnostic distribution. Gross profit of $118 million in the quarter increased $4 million over 2013 levels. Gross margin of 44.9% decreased 140 basis points from 46.3% last year primarily due to the impact of lower gross margin Challenger products and $1.8 million of higher restructuring cost partially offset by continued savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses totalled 59.9 million in the quarter and operating expense margin of 22.8% improved 50 basis points from 23.3% last year largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage and the effects of the Challenger acquisition partially offset by inflationary and other cost increases.  First quarter operating earnings of 58.1 million for the RS&I Group increased 1.6 million from prior year levels. The operating margin of 22.1% in the quarter declined 90 basis points from last year as lower margins associated with Challenger and a 60 basis point impact from higher restructuring cost more than offset benefits from the on-going RCI initiatives. Now turning to slide 10, in the first quarter, earnings from financial services of 34.4 million increased 12.8% and revenues of 50.2 million increased 14.1% in both the first quarters of 2014 and 2013 the average yield on finance receivables was 17.5% and the average yield of contract receivables was 9.5%. Originations of $202.1 million in the quarter increased $30.2 million or 17.6% compared to 2013 levels. Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately 1.3 billion of gross financing receivables including 1.1 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the first quarter, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew approximately $28 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to in line with our expectations. Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operations of $88.3 million in the quarter increased $12.6 million from comparable 2013 levels primarily as a result of higher 2014 net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $50.9 million included $30.3 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of 18.3 million in the quarter compared with $14.7 million last year. Turning to slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 65 days compared with 62 days at 2013 year end. Inventories increased $18.2 million from 2013 year end, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions as well as to improve service levels.  On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory of 3.8 times remained consistent with our year end levels. Our quarter end cash position of $127.8 million decreased $89.8 million from 2013 year end levels primarily as a result of the March 2014 repayment of $100 million of unsecured notes at maturity.  In addition, the net decrease in cash also reflects the impacts of funding 169.7 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $25.6 million and share repurchases of $22.1 million as well as 18.3 million of capital expenditures. These uses of cash were partially offset by $139.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $88.3 million of cash from operations and $12.8 million of cash from stock purchase and option plan exercises. At the end of the first quarter, our net debt to capital ratio was 25.5%. In addition to our $128 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper market should we chose to do so. At quarter end, no amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities.  With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick. Nicholas Pinchuk :  Thanks Aldo. Well as I said at the start, we are encouraged by the quarter. We believe the results are more clear evidence of potential and they are added confirmation of what we\u2019ve been saying for some time that as we look forward, Snap-on has abundant and wide runways for both improvements and for growth. We believe the quarter\u2019s performance adds to a long trend which reinforces that outlook. We are moving down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, sales growing by 6% new products strong franchise metrics and a credit company is amplifying that strength. Expanding repair shop owners and managers, new diagnostics and information products, growing stronger with independent shops, Challenger Lifts giving us more to sell, extending the critical industries C&I growing organically at 10% with over 200 basis with an over 200 basis points increase in OI margins and building in emerging markets, ramping up our new lift factory and growing even in a place like India where economic and election uncertainty are major headwinds today. We\u2019re also progressing down our runways for improvements, Snap-on value creation, safety, quality customer connection innovation and RCI driving margin gains. So we\u2019re encouraged by the continuing trends, but we believe there is much more ample opportunities and clear runway for growing and improving. And we believe that with the inherent advantages we hold, the investments we\u2019re making and the capable team we\u2019re enlisting, we will extend on a positive trend for the foreseeable future. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I believe it\u2019s appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know that once again, many of you are listening. The encouraging results of the first quarter and the positive trends we\u2019re demonstrating are direct result of your extraordinary capability and your continuing commitment. For the role you play in our on-going achievement, you have my congratulations. And for your unfailing dedication to our team, you have my thanks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We\u2019ll take our first question from David Leiker with Robert Baird. Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.:  Hi good morning. This is Joe Vruwink on line for David. I wanted to start, is it possible to quantify any impact weather might have had on the tools group in the quarter? I\u2019d imagine some of the van routes were impacted and obviously fewer repairs are going on, mechanics have less money in their pockets. So, anyway to quantify that? Nicholas Pinchuk : The short answer is no. My response to that it\u2019s always something. And so yes, we had some tough winter and routes were attenuated in some time and I rode a number of these vans and when you stop at garage, I think I said this on the last call. Some guys say business is great, because we\u2019re tearing up transmissions and chassis are getting bumped around and so there is lot of business here. Other people are saying, hey the business is terrible. So it\u2019s hard to quantify it. Certainly it might have imposed some cauterization on us a little bit. But I think for our perspective, we\u2019re not really looking at it as something that is that unusual, just something that comes up and we manage over it. Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.: May be as the quarter progressed, so we obviously started getting better weather in March, April has been a little bit better I suppose, has your sales activity picked up kind of in line with that cadence? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well yes, but it's hard to quantify Joe because to tell you the truth last year, if you looked at last year we had people seem to go on a sabbatical in early January, so we had a kind of back end loaded cauterization, it tends to happen from time to time from quarter-to-quarter. So there isn\u2019t always great intelligence looking from months to months. So yes, we did see some uptick but I am not sure you can read that much into that. Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.: And then just looking at the origination growth and financial services, if I kind of use that as a parameter for activity in the tools business 18% obviously a lot higher than the 6% organic growth for the segments. Is there a way to kind of understand the disconnect there and is 18% so parameter for barometer for just generally\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : What I can give you -- unfortunately from quarter to quarter, it\u2019s hard to tie it exactly because there is a -- what we say is and you have probably heard us say this over and over is that the originations should roughly follow the growth of the tools groups big ticket items which is primarily tools storage in some of the larger diagnostics. So a matter of fact over the last several quarters and in again this quarter, big ticket grew greater that the tools group in general so you have that factor. Now in the full year we believe that comes out roughly parallel as the originations and big ticket sales roughly parallel, tools group big ticket sales and originations roughly are parallel and all work out. But from a quarter to quarter remember, we\u2019re recognizing a sale to a franchisee. He is not necessarily selling it right away onwards, he necessarily doesn\u2019t do the deal, so you have some disconnect in terms of cauterization as you cross over the month, so it\u2019s very hard to tie quarterly numbers between originations in the tools group. I will tell you that it is indications that tools group big ticket sales were sold at higher rates year over year than the average tools group and that\u2019s true in this quarter. Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay. And then... Nicholas Pinchuk : Other than you can\u2019t really draw much from one quarter. Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Sure, that makes sense. Switching across the pond and looking at Europe, you talk a lot about runways for growth and I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s the runway in Europe not only from revenues, but Nick you think restructuring Europe C&I I think your entire 10 year at Snap-on, so what could be the OpEx goal? Nicholas Pinchuk : It seems like it. I hate to comment on Europe anymore because I am usually wrong. But the thing is look, what happened in Europe, what\u2019s happened in Europe is we have been continually applying Snap-on value creation, improving our productivity and efficiency even in the darkest of downturns, we have said that our customers have not gone away therefore in doing this whether it\u2019s restructuring, in closing facilities or in creating efficiencies we have not removed productive capacity. So as I said in my remarks, that started to come home with positive traction several quarters ago where SNA Europe our European hand tool business was showing improvements and profitability even as the sales were going down.  And now with the sales going upwards, it adds that, that leverage adds that because there is good leverage because we didn\u2019t take out any productive capacity. Remember that when you talk about where is Europe and as Europe turn the corner and what\u2019s happening in Europe, it\u2019s still down 20% to 25% from the peak. So we\u2019re coming, we\u2019re literally coming off the canvas. So while we\u2019ve had two quarters, I am still from Missouri to see where we\u2019re going for a longer term, still it\u2019s a positive event and it contributed nicely to C&I although it was not the only contributor to C&I. Joe Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co.: Okay. So when I think about your former peak margin in C&I at 13% in 2008, you're doing 13.5 now and so with Europe 20% or 25% off the top, fair to say that there is still a lot more upside there? Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure I\u2019ve always said that I believe there is a lot of runway in C&I actually I am pretty bullish about the C&I business, it\u2019s just that C&I been the repository of headwinds I think, they have military, they had the European headwinds and so on, so they\u2019ve had some difficult bumps, but we feel confident about that business, SNA Europe, the critical industries those are great businesses. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Liam Burke with Janney Capital Markets. Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Nick you talked about the Snap-on tools doing well internationally. Is one country or another doing particularly well or are you seeing just very solid international growth? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, generally I would say if you look back over, I think I talked about Snap-on tools growing over the years like 9% and 9.2% and 10.7% and 7.6% last year and if you look over the 16 quarters that are involved in that international grew pretty well in general. This particular quarter, UK grew nicely, better than -- about may be little bit better than the average. Canada grew even more. Australia actually was down slightly, down slightly. Some of that could have been currency. The tools group, man they got hammered with currency in terms of transaction because you\u2019ve got the Canadian dollar weakening and you got the Aussie dollar weakening versus the U.S. dollar where we make the products we\u2019re moving into those markets and U.S. dollars we\u2019re shipping them in, and so does transaction impact. And so that played out a little bit in the Australian volume I think. UK has been across the company, pretty strong. I think on balance, you could say international is pretty good, but color in this quarter, Australia is may be feeling the weight of the currency problem a little bit. Liam Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : Okay, great, and Aldo you had DSO step up three days. Is that timing or is this something different? Is it more international? Aldo Pagliari : I would say above one-day due to the timing of sales where they fall in the collection cycle. But what you are seeing there, you\u2019re spot on. The international mix is a little bit more robust. The term structurally in the international markets tends to be longer than that in the U.S. And then behind-the-scenes you have the fact that military is a little bit less than what it had been in prior years. The government's pays quick and the governments often times even uses credit cards. So that always helped to be a sole calculation. And then finally, if you look at emerging markets, those places that have some spot liquidity issues, places you look like at China, India, Brazil, you have a lot less cash-and-carry business, and the result, in distribution circles there you have to provide little bit more structural terms. That's normal. It goes with the terms, so as those markets mature, in our presence, and then mature, I think you will see a little bit more classic dated outstanding rather than cash-and-carry type activities. Operator : (Operator Instructions). And we will take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Good morning all, can you hear me, all right, because I am on a cellphone? Nicholas Pinchuk : We have a little background, but we can hear you fine. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : That\u2019s because I\u2019m at the airport but anyway, Nick when you look at that dealer business, you said those re-facilitations were winding down. If you back out some of that business that\u2019s winding down, do you have a sense of just what the growth was just to dealers overall? Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't have a dealer overall growth, but I'd say it\u2019s -- if you look at our -- one of the things that I wanted to say was is that I think we said in the call that RS&I would grow without the wind down of the dealerships. And we think it'd be mid-single digits, that kind of growth, if you pull out that OEM lumpiness. If you went back to our earnings calls last year, it was growing, we had some pretty good growth in RS&I we are saying that some of that was accelerated by some of these movements. So, we said overtime that RS&I, the margins can be moved by that and also the growth can be a little bit lumpy. We are actually pretty pleased with it because the other businesses, particularly in the independent space are growing nicely. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, it just makes sense because the dealerships are doing well too overall. And then, in terms of -- do you have any facilities business, et cetera in the Ukraine? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, we have some business in the Ukraine. We have a sales office there. But its peanuts, you know, I mean really Ukraine is not -- it\u2019s a very-very small exposure at the Ukraine. If you talk about the Ukraine and Russia, it\u2019s a little bit bigger, but it\u2019s still a smaller piece of the business, maybe 1% of the total for the organization. And that business, and these numbers are down, already and these numbers are down multiple decades. We have seen -- we saw some headwind here. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : And then lastly I had another question on just the growth in the tool business in Europe, but if you look at your business overall in Europe, you know the southern tier countries had always been very sluggish and declines really the northern countries had been doing a little bit better. Are you starting to see a pickup in places like Spain, Italy, countries like that? Are you starting to see any growth in revenues out of those countries? Or is it specifically all the north countries? Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. No-no-no, actually we see revenue growth in our tools business; the SNA-Europe business in Spain and Italy, Portugal, actually France even, and Germany and so on. So we see -- sort of a center of Europe, UK is pretty good. The Eastern European businesses, as you might expect, are weak. There is some growth in Turkey, for example. So that\u2019s kind of pushing it. I will say that, sometimes I think we went so down so far in Spain and Portugal that any kind of growth, just kind of not so big but it's still positive from what we see. It\u2019s so positive and encouraging event, yes. Operator : We'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes, good morning everyone. Can you talk about the extent to which your growth in international business may have supported the large origination number? Aldo Pagliari :  I will take that. It was fairly evenly balanced. But the originations are still more influenced by the activity in the United States. So certainly you can look at the International portfolio grew as well, but no one do buy us one way or the other. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, and you mentioned that the origination should converge with the tools business over the course of the year, that from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, you can see divergence a bit over the course of the year that should converge. So does that imply that we\u2019re going to see a fairly substantial reduction heading into 2Q and 3Q here in the origination? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, I didn\u2019t actually say, what I said specifically was it should converge with big ticket sales in the tools group. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay, good. Nicholas Pinchuk : And so that doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate exactly with the overall tools group number, in fact for many quarters they\u2019ve been higher. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And then within that big ticket, you talked about the fact I guess storage and diagnostics are really driving the big ticket within the tools segment as I understand. Do we begin to anniversary something here in the next quarter or two that would create a substantially slower year over year growth? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, I don\u2019t know. I think -- look I have said forever that I think we expect our growth to be at 4% to 6% organically and this is at the top end and we grew like I said at 9%, 9.2%, 10.7% and 7.6% in the past year, so that will be outside that. So eventually you might expect the tools group to come down to where I said, but we have some great strengths in the tools group. We are ramping up the innovation engine with customer connection and innovation so we have more new products than ever before. We have these new marketing activities which are breaking the boundaries of the van, the Rock N' Roll Cab that has 56 on the road now and they are breaking the space constraint and adding to that tools storage and we\u2019ve raised the Techno-Vans which support the diagnostic sales to 18. A year ago, those numbers 56 and 18 were 36 and 4 and two years ago were just 18. So we are pumping more support into the tools group. So I wouldn\u2019t want to call for a cooling on the other hand we do say over time it\u2019s 4% to 6%. I am not saying it\u2019s going to happen, that we\u2019d see a reduction next quarter though, I don\u2019t see a lapping being a factor. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Just a couple other questions, I guess on the change in working investments. Aldo you went into some detail about the things that are stressing your DSOs and that was helpful. I noticed though that going back over say the last two years, first quarter \u201912 it was a 13.9 good guy in \u201913 it was negative 55, and in \u201914 were negative 42.5. Is that reflecting just the structural shift so the growing international business, the slowdown in military, the things that Aldo discussed here, is there something else going on there? Aldo Pagliari : I think the same variables do characterize, you\u2019re talking about just the receivables element in working capital is that [Multiple Speakers] are longer that\u2019s a fact of life. The international mix of business does then impact that, emerging markets as they mature does move from a certain percent of business being as I said cash and carry and short term oriented to more traditional distributor terms. And finally the realization of the government is a little bit of a less of a player in our mix. They were one of the ones that have the most rapid payment terms usually and they do pay properly. Nicholas Pinchuk : I\u2019ll just jump in here, one of the things that is going on here is, if you shipped to C&I, I think we have of course the great progress in Europe where we\u2019ve gotten another quarter of growth and we have been pounding Snap-on value creation, so we have nice leverage rolling out of that.  But, there is also a great component of extension to critical industries where we had some big wins in aviation, those are very profitable but they\u2019re not the military business, they change the nature of the payable of the receivables and we are not only in aviation, but we\u2019re also extending internationally. One of the things we worried about in critical industries where we able to project and roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage into aviation and oil and gas and those things, and that\u2019s working. And then further than that, are you able to project it internationally, well that\u2019s really working this quarter and that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s driven, that\u2019s one of the big factor, may be the biggest factor in driving the 10.4% growth in C&I and a great component of the 200 basis points improvement. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes, okay. And the last question if I could, just last question, you paid down 100 million of debt in the quarter. Clearly the balance sheet is over capitalized at this point. I don\u2019t want to be the guy to force or pound the table, but you need to do acquisitions I hate to see you stress that. But what is your thought process on just using some of this capitalization capacity to buyback more stock rather than wait for opportunities to surface on the M&A front? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, I think we\u2019ve made it clear that, two factors I\u2019ll say, our priorities for cash are; working capital investment and the organic business you just pointed out, some of the requirements we can have as we expand our business to different places. We see it in our working capital today; we\u2019re growing but its eating working capital. We knew this was coming. We are looking at M&A. We view each months, we\u2019re reviewing a list of M&A and we will act on this and we\u2019re confident we can find targets because we keep looking at severely each month; thirdly, we keep our dividend in perpetuity and we know our investors like that dividend, like those dividends and it depends on it, and then the idea of buying back stock to offset dilution. We see that as our cash priority. And I would add on top of that though, that\u2019s our current cash priority, but I would add on top of it, we know that as we generate cash and have capability, we will be judged on how we wheel that, we know that. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Are you considering large transformative acquisitions or are they... Nicholas Pinchuk : No nothing transformative. We think we can make acquisitions, we\u2019ve seen several large acquisitions that didn\u2019t quite work out that were sort of semi-coherent, on closer look it wasn\u2019t. We believe we can make acquisitions that give us more to sell and more strength with the customer basis that are along our runways for growth, that is the technicians, the repair shop owners and managers, people in the critical industries are in emerging markets. And we can do that without having to transform. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : So if we got to the end of the year and you still hadn\u2019t done a larger transaction, you still had the kind of overcapitalized balance sheet you have today. Would you consider accelerating share repurchase activity? Nicholas Pinchuk : I am not sure. I\u2019d wait till I get to the end of the year at that. Operator : And next we\u2019ll go to Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.:  I wanted to ask about, on the military spending, has that now completely anniversaried, in other words the first quarter last year was the quarter where we really saw a big decline in that area of the business, correct? Nicholas Pinchuk : Actually I think it was the fourth quarter of the prior year, but if the answer is it completely anniversaried, the answer is no, because it keeps going down but the base is smaller. So the impact on us -- it isn\u2019t that it didn\u2019t impact us, it did. But the base on which the reduction is operating is smaller; therefore it\u2019s less of an irritant. It doesn\u2019t create the screen in C&I that it did before. So the way I characterize in my script and I think this is accurate, it no longer masks some of the progress that was happening because it\u2019s smaller. I mean basically that business is down, more than half, its way down. So it keeps coming down, and was down in the quarter couple of decades of percentages. So it was down again, but the base that it operates thus far. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.: Is the European hand tools business that you mentioned that improved for the first time in quite a while? Was that down about the same kind of magnitude that military was down? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, not that much but it was down let\u2019s say 25% in sales. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.: And then on the Challenger Lift business, is the nature of that equipment and the historic margins such that this would represent, always represent margins that are less than that segment\u2019s average and therefore if sales in that business increase more so than the sales in the rest of RS&I, it would cause margins to be slightly diluted? Nicholas Pinchuk : If the question is, I mean I think this is the question. Is the Challenger margin -- are the Challenger margins 23%? The answer is no. And therefore for some time and for either substantially lower than that, so for some time growth in Challenger margins, [indiscernible] Challenger sales would be detrimental to the overall RS&I margin numbers. However it might help, it might raise its profitability for the corporation and so on. And by the way, we\u2019ll be working on the Challenger margins over time with Snap-on value creation to keep improving it. But there is a big gap between the Snap-on, between the Challenger margins and the overall RS&I margins. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.:   That gap is what is actually I was getting at and what I was getting at is that is Challenger is just the nature of this product and the pricing in that segment of the business such that you\u2019ll never get to the 20 some odd percent that the RS&I group does, it will always be lower than that general mark. Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, yes, I guess, I mean I think is sure always is a long time even for a guy like me. And I have a lot of confidence in Snap-on value creation, so I think it can move it upwards. So I would never see the idea that never get there. But it\u2019s certainly a long pull. Now remember though, that we lap the acquisition in the second quarter. So we acquired Challenger, I don\u2019t know half way to two-thirds of the way through the second quarter of last year. So once we get into the third quarter, its apples-to-apples. What you\u2019re seeing now with the drag is in apples-to-oranges comparison, that\u2019s why we (want) [ph] it out. I mean RS&I actually had a pretty good quarter, it had 60 basis points of restructuring impact year-over-year and another multiple decade, a doll-up of Challenger impact and that occluded the relatively strong RCI achievement that it made in the 50 to 60 basis points. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc.: Certainly was an impressive quarter on margin performance. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Operator : And we have no further question in the queue at this time. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks everyone for joining us this morning, a replay of the call will be available on snapon.com shortly. And as always, we do appreciate your interest in the company. Thanks a lot. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s presentation. We thank you all for your participation.",

Pagliari - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance Analysts : Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated Second Quarter Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Leslie H. Kratcoski: Thanks, Randy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website, next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I'll start today with some of the highlights of our second quarter, the general environment and the trends we're seeing, as well as some of the progress we made. And Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. Our second quarter results were encouraging. They offer strong evidence of Snap-on advancements along our run rates for both growth and for improvement. Our sales were up 8.2% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 130 basis points. And the earnings per share, they reached $1.80, up 20%, compared with the $1.50 reported last year. The organic sales increase was 6.6%. Incremental sales from our Challenger acquisition in May of last year, and coupled with our acquisition of Pro-Cut this past quarter, added another $10.5 million, which, along with $1.4 million of favorable foreign currency, brought our total sales for the period to $826.5 million. The operating margin for opco reached 16.7%, up from 15.4% in 2013. Financial Services' operating income increased to $34.8 million from last year's $30.6 million, driving the consolidated operating margin to 19.7%, also up 130 basis points. Now from a macro perspective, we believe the favorable conditions remain for our businesses serving automotive repair customers; the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group. Both have continued to experience strong demand, and in the second quarter, both of them reached new sales levels. Tools Group activity increased 6.6%. The strength of our band channel is clearly evident in those numbers and in the [indiscernible]. RS&I had an overall -- had overall organic gains of 7.7%, led by significant essential tool and facilitation sales in OEM dealerships. For the C&I group, for C&I, there are also continued signs of improvement along our runways for growth. We saw important and clear progress in our efforts extending to critical industries, and in building the physicals in the emerging markets of Asia-Pacific. U.S. Military activity. It's been a significant C&I headwind. Well, the military experience is somewhat of a resurgence, up double digits from the second quarter of last year, the first year-over-year increase since mid-2012. The C&I results are positive. We do, however, remain cautious as to the improvement within the U.S. Military business. At this point, the length and the amplitude of any recovery is quite uncertain. With that said, though, the opportunities for C&I definitely outweigh the challenges, and the results confirm it. More broadly, the operating income gains across the corporation clearly demonstrate the leverage and the power of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes : safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. They drive our improvement every day, and they helped author our 130-basis-point gain this quarter. As I speak to the segment results, I'll highlight some of those advancements in both growth and in improvement. Let's start with C&I. I just said -- as I just said, an 8.4% organic sales increase. The group's operating margin was up 70 basis points, even while overcoming an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 80 basis points. Both higher volumes and the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation drove the margin improvement, more than offsetting the currency. Related to the volume, there were some positive gains in the group's operating unit. SNA Europe had its third straight quarter of year-over-year group -- growth, a promising trend, outperforming the present economic conditions within its own markets. SNA Europe also showed clear margin improvements in the quarter, capitalizing on the volume increases, leveraging the uptick in activity and realizing the benefits of RCI and past restructuring actions. That effect was evident in SNA Europe's growing profitability. Also in C&I, the Industrial division saw particularly strong volume in the critical aviation sector, and it's a continuation of favorable trends we saw in the first quarter. And besides the encouraging trend -- the encouraging aerospace volume, the quarter also saw a success in extending to other critical industries like natural resources, where sales were up double digits. Some of those gains -- some of these gains can be attributed to a growing line of innovative products, guided by strong customer connections, specifically designed for critical applications. One such product was just launched aimed at the power generation industry. It was the K3477, our ground-mounted transformer access tool. This new utility tool is perfect for removing or securing the penta-style bolts on underground utility transformers. It's also effective in a variety of other applications in the power generation and delivery industry. The K3477 features a pentagon socket at one end and a 3/4 hex socket at the other. The pentagon side gains access and the hex side is used on the terminals inside the transformer. The new unit employs the Snap-on -- importantly, the new unit employs the Snap-on award-winning Dual 80 ratchet technology for smooth performance, enabling the smallest of ratchet swings, very helpful in tight quarters within a transformer box. The K3477, another tool born from Snap-on customer connection, making work easier for professionals and workplaces of consequence. Reaching to new markets, the Industrial division organized hands-on product training just for its Latin American region. The meeting was attended by about 125 customers and a number of our sales reps. It included a series of in-depth technical training sessions, familiarizing customers with our latest product offering, emphasizing opportunities across the continents in multiple segments, areas like mining, oil and gas, aerospace. Industrial -- our Industrial division, rolling out of the garage, reaching new segments and new geographies like Latin America. Industrial is also working to create more customers for life in technical education. We continue to add to our list of Snap-on certified schools. Already this year, 35 new institutions have embraced our certification protocols, helping us lead in providing top-notch curriculums to the technicians of the future. We continue to build in emerging economies, areas of strong potential, and we saw sales progress in bellwether markets like China and India, activity up nicely compared to last year. C&I did have a positive quarter. It did have a positive quarter. And we know there's even more opportunity, and we're continuing in the pursuit. Let's move to the Tools Group. Sales increased 6.6% organically. Operating margin of 16.4% was also up, versus the 15.7% recorded last year, overcoming within the quarter 60 basis points of unfavorable currency impacts largely related to our operations in Australia and Canada. The 70 basis point brings our Tools Group OI margins to new levels, and that performance clearly speaks to our improving position. And when combined with the growth this quarter, it clearly demonstrates the vast -- the success we're having on this decisive runway, enhancing the franchisee channel. You can see it in the sales, and you can see it in the overall franchisee health metrics, trending positively again this quarter. Snap-on franchisees are a committed and capable force, and we're working hard every day to support their effort through creative marketing, in-house customer financing with Snap-on Credit and a growing array of innovative new products. New products like our Push-Pull Spring Tool range, designed to remove and install springs on automobiles, heavy-duty trucks and agricultural equipment with precision and speed. You see, today's techs commonly use picks and screwdrivers for these applications. These standards -- but these standard tools sometimes slip, causing the spring to go flying or to drop into the mechanism. It's a productivity killer. Snap-on's Push-Pull Spring units are uniquely designed with a robust shank and a deep V- and C-shaped grooves to securely hold and maneuver small- and medium-sized springs. It's a winning tool line shaped by direct observation, customer trial and feedback. Products like our power tools, our 14 -- our new power tools. So 14 -- let's take one. A 14.4-volt, 3/8-inch cordless impact wrench, high torque, small size, power in your product -- in your pocket. This impact gun and its twin, the 14.4-volt cordless screwdriver, combine to display Snap-on innovation and to help drive the Tools Group volume. On another front, the growing strength of our Tools Group marketing is also evident with the increases in big-ticket sales. And a lot of that credit goes to Snap-on hands-on demonstration vehicles, the Rock 'N Roll Cab Express and the TechKnow Express vans, both driving excitement and sales. The Rock 'N Roll Express showcases a broad range of Snap-on tool storage -- of the Snap-on tool storage line, colors, shapes, options. You've been listening to these calls for any time, you've heard that the product variety made available for hands-on selection on the Rock 'N Roll van is a significant contributor to the Tools Group growth. For handheld diagnostics, the TechKnow Express vans. The TechKnow Express vans follow the path blazed by the Rock 'N Roll Express, offering customers the ability to touch and to feel and to navigate. In essence, try out our assortment of diagnostic solutions, easing the way to make that big-ticket buying decision, all under one roof. And we keep adding to our TechKnow fleet. We now have 24 with more on the way. Another advantage for the Tools Group is our Financial Services arm, Snap-on Credit, strategic programs aimed at smoothing the way for those big-ticket categories of tool storage and diagnostics. Again this quarter, our credit company played an essential role in enhancing our van channel and helping us drive the sales growth. Well, that's the Tools Group. Attractive new products guided by customer connection, innovative marketing and a unique credit capability, all helping the vans reach new levels. Now let's move to RS&I. Organic sales growth of 7.7%, while the second quarter operating margin of 23.2%, 23.2%, compared to last year's 23%. The overall sales gain was $32.3 million, or 13.1%. $19.1 million of organic sales, $2.7 million of favorable currency, and $10.5 million of sales from our acquisition Challenger Lifts and our recent add, Pro-Cut International. We're excited to add Pro-Cut to the portfolio, a well-established brand that complements the RS&I lineup. Challenger Lifts and the newly acquired Pro-Cut advance brake servicing product line, both giving us more to sell to vehicle repair shop owners and managers, to customers and independent shops and national service chains and in OEM dealerships. They're both positive steps along our runway for coherent growth in the repair garage. Beyond acquisitions, RS&I registered organic sales gains across the group, from repair information to diagnostic products within independent repair shops, to program activity in support of OEM dealerships. The robust organic sales were driven, in part, by innovation in new product lines. In April, a new product launch -- in April, the diagnostic division was, again, voted the Top 10 tool Award winner by the readers of Undercar Digest magazine. These awards are determined by technicians and shop owners, the people who use diagnostics every day to make their living. And they voted 2 Snap-on handheld units, the VERUS PRO and the ETHOS Plus, as being among their most important tools. This, again, -- This, again, extends our string of Undercar Digest Top 10 Awards for Snap-on diagnostics. Our past winners include, listen to this list, VERUS, VERDICT, SOLUS PRO, SOLUS Ultra, and now the VERUS PRO and ETHOS Plus, a parade of innovation. New products also helped bolster our sales in our OEM solution business, up double digits in the quarter. One assist in that growth was our expansion in the agricultural sector. In the period, we launched distribution of the essential diagnostic system for a major manufacturer of agricultural equipment, with repair outlets over 5 continents. The system will be used in 6 facilities and in mobile shops to deliver diagnostic repair services across the globe. We like this program. It has strategic -- it has significant strategic importance in extending our diagnostic reach to new customers in another critical arena : agricultural equipment. Another product, another new product, the Snap-on PRO-LINK Ultra heavy-truck diagnostic tool, was also launched in the quarter. It's a next-generation device that'll make work easier in more than 60,000 heavy-duty shops throughout North America. This new unit helps diagnose and repair a variety of problems, including engine transmission and brake issues on commercial vehicles ranging from light diesels to Class 8 heavy-duty trucks. The PRO-LINK Ultra has a faster processor, includes more memory, is Wi-Fi enabled and incorporates updated OEM software and arrives preconfigured for a repair connect upgrade. That's Snap-on's proprietary system that allows users to link trouble codes with the most likely fixes based on our extensive library of real vehicle repair data. To wrap up RS&I, we've seen new diagnostics, unique repair information for cars and for trucks, and a growing undercar equipment offering that now adds both Challenger and Pro-Cut products to our established lines. Real strengths that are driving positive trends and have improved our positions with repair shop owners and managers, and you can see it in the results. Well, that's the highlights of the quarter : growth and improvement; sales up 6.6% organically, overcoming headwinds; OI margin of 16.7%, up 130 basis points; C&I strength with critical industries and with SNA Europe's ongoing improvement, the third straight quarter of year-over-year growth; the Tools Group getting stronger, robust sales and operating margin, continuing to enhance our franchise network with success; RS&I, advancing its position with gains in both independent shops and OEMs; and Financial Services, raising its contribution both financially and strategically. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo, who will take you through the financials in detail. Aldo J. Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $826.5 million in the quarter increased $62.4 million, or 8.2%, from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all segments, and include higher sales to auto repair mechanics, customers in critical industries and OEM dealerships. Organically, sales increased 6.6%, excluding $10.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $1.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $400.4 million increased $27.2 million from 2013 levels. Gross margin of 48.4% in the quarter decreased 40 basis points, primarily due to 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $262.3 million increased $6.9 million. The operating expenses margin of 31.7% improved 170 basis points from 33.4% a year ago, primarily due to sales volume leverage. Restructuring costs of $1.4 million in the quarter compares to $1.8 million of such costs last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $138.1 million in the quarter increased $20.3 million, or 17.2%, and, as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 16.7%. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $34.8 million increased 13.7% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings totaled $172.2 million, and the operating margin of 19.7% improved 130 basis points from 18.4% a year ago. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 32.9% compared with 32.5% last year. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $106.1 million, or $1.80 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $88.4 million, or $1.50 per share last year, representing a 20% increase in earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $287.2 million in the quarter were up 8.4% organically, primarily reflecting a double-digit sales gain to customers in critical industries and a mid-single-digit sales increase in our European-based hand tool business. Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $111.8 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38.9% decreased 70 basis points from last year, as benefits from increased sales and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives were more than offset by higher costs, including $2.7 million, or 80 basis points, of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $73.6 million in the quarter increased $1.8 million over 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses. The operating expense margin of 25.6% improved 140 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, second quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $38.2 million increased $4.6 million, or 13.7%, from 2013 levels; and the operating margin of 13.3% improved 70 basis points from 12.6% last year, despite 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects. Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $369.1 million increased 6.6% organically, reflecting a mid-single-digit sales increase in our U.S. franchise operations and a high single-digit sales increase in our international franchise operations. Gross profit of $161.1 million increased $8.2 million from 2013 levels, while the gross margin of 43.6% decreased 60 basis points, due to $2.1 million, or 60 basis points, of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $100.6 million in the quarter increased $2.2 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses. The operating expense margin of 27.2% improved 130 basis points from 28.5% last year, primarily due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $60.5 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $6 million, or 11%; and the operating margin of 16.4% improved 70 basis points from 15.7%. Turning now to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $278.5 million increased $32.3 million, or 13.1%, from 2013 levels. Excluding $10.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation, organic sales were up 7.7%, primarily due to a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealership service and repair shops and a mid-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $127.5 million in the quarter increased $12.6 million over 2013 levels. Gross margin of 45.8% decreased 90 basis points, primarily due to a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and facilitation sales to OEM dealerships, as well as sales of Challenger products. Continued savings from ongoing RCI initiatives more than offset $0.6 million, or a higher restructuring cost. Operating expenses totaled $62.9 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 22.6% improved 110 basis points from 23.7% last year largely due to sales volume leverage, including benefits from the sales shift discussed earlier. Second quarter operating earnings of $64.6 million for the RS&I group increased $7.9 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 23.2% in the quarter improved 20 basis points. Now turning to Slide 10. In the second quarter, earnings from Financial Services of $34.8 million and revenues of $51.7 million compares with operating earnings of $30.6 million on revenue of $44.5 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.5% compared with 17.4% last year. The average yield on contract receivables of 9.5% compared with 9.6% last year. Originations of $232.7 million in the quarter increased 14.6% from 2013 levels. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.1 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the second quarter, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew approximately $65 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $124.4 million in the quarter increased $14.3 million from comparable 2013 levels, primarily as a result of higher 2014 net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $119.7 million included $58 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables, and also included $41.6 million for the previously communicated acquisition of Pro-Cut. Capital expenditures of $22.7 million in the quarter compared with $16.7 million last year. Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 64 days compared with 62 days at 2013 year end and 65 days at the end of the first quarter. Inventories increased $33.1 million from 2013 year end, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions, and from the addition of inventories related to Pro-Cut. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.7x compared with turns of 3.8 at 2013 year end. The quarter-end cash position of $115.8 million decreased $101.8 million from 2013 year-end levels. That's primarily due to $100 million March 2014 debt repayment. The net decrease in cash also reflects the impacts of funding $370.6 million of new finance receivables; share repurchases of $62.5 million, or 550,000 shares; dividend payments of $51.2 million; the acquisition of Pro-Cut for $41.6 million; and $41 million of capital expenditures. These uses of cash were partially offset by $282.3 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $212.7 million of cash from operations. At the end of the second quarter, our net debt-to-cap ratio was 26%. In addition to our $116 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At quarter end, we had $29.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. I'll conclude by mentioning a few outlook items. We continue to expect that our full year 2014 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2013 rate of 32.3%, and we now anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be in the range of $75 million to $80 million. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. Well, as I said at the start, we are encouraged by the quarter. We believe the results are more confirmation of our progress, but they're also clear evidence of the opportunities that remain. We've been saying for some time that as we look forward, Snap-on has abundant runways -- abundant and wide runways for both improvement and for growth, and we believe that the quarter's performance adds to a long trend that reinforces that outlook. We are demonstrating clear gains moving down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network. Tools Group sales growing, operating earnings at new heights, innovative new products, strong franchisee metrics and a credit company amplifying that strength with greater effects, expanding with our repair shop owners and managers, RS&I growing, diagnostics and information products stronger with independent shops. A successful Challenger acquisition and a new Pro-Cut addition widening the product offering, extending to critical industries. C&I growing organically at 8.4% with a 70 basis point increase in OI margins, overcoming 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. Rolling the Snap-On brand out of the garage to sectors like aviation and natural resources. SNA Europe clawing back. Building in emerging markets, the physicals getting stronger each quarter and seeing it in our market position. We're also progressing down our runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation of rapid continuous improvement, driving margin gains across the entire corporation. So we are encouraged by the continuing trends. Sales up 6.6% organically, opco OI margin reaching 16.7%, rising 130 basis points. But we believe there is much more, and we are confident that we're positioned with the capability and the intent to take full advantage and to continue our trajectory of positive performance for the foreseeable future. Before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know that, once again, many of you are listening. Our progress in the second quarter and the positive trends are a direct result of your extraordinary capability and your continuing commitment. The role you play in our ongoing achievement, you have my congratulations. And for your unfailing dedication to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Liam Burke from Janney Capital Markets. Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : In terms of Snap-on Tools, you have tools that are guaranteed for life. Now you're seeing a pretty nice growth out of that base market. Is it bigger-ticket items, is it new product introductions or is it market share that are contributing to this better-than-average, better-than-expected growth? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: That's a great question. One of the great questions I think is -- one of our big product lines are hand tools, we guarantee them for life. So how is it we have a business at all? And the answer is, is what happens in the marketplace, particularly in the auto repair marketplace, there's a tremendous motion of technology that creates the requirements, things like the spring tool, like the Push-Pull Spring Tool I talked about, and a number of other products. And so when you look at this business, you see -- first and foremost, you see innovative new products rolling out, because our Snap-on Value Creation around customer connection and innovation is working better before -- better than ever before, and we're having more hit products than we've ever had, 5 or 6 times what we had just in 2006. So you see a lot of those and that creates excitement. So we're doing that better. Underlying that is the change in the vehicles, that's one. Two is, we're reaching more customers because we're enabling our van drivers to be more effective. Part of that is really innovative marketing. Things like the Rock 'N Roll Cab Express and the TechKnow Express, and other things we're doing on the van to make our drivers better. And this general productivity rolling through the van is pretty good. And then, thirdly, the credit company. Since we brought the credit company home, we've learned more things about credit than we ever thought we could, especially applied strategically in the marketplace. And all this is coming together with a team that's starting to learn this. And the Tools Group is singing. I mean, you see the sales of 6.6% this quarter, and I think that last second quarter it was 7%, and the second quarter before that it was 10%, and the second quarter before that it was 10%, and the second quarter before that it was 7.6%. Now, I'm not -- as I say, we think -- we say we're going to grow organically at 4% to 6%, and the Tools Group, by all rights, should be at the lower end of that, and that's what we keep saying. But our team in the Tools Group is doing a great job, and they are expanding their position. I'm not going to say we have a bigger market share, but I kind of like the numbers. Liam D. Burke - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division : And real quickly on C&I, you see -- continuing to see some momentum build in Europe. Are there any verticals or critical industries that are doing particularly well? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Look, I think Europe, the play is more by country, perhaps you might say that. I mean, I think no particular industry. I don't think you're seeing the construction industry come back too quickly. And we felt -- in some of that, the agricultural industries are good, big industry is good, aviation is okay. But I want to emphasize what I said in my call, we're growing mid-single digits in Europe in places like Germany and France and even Spain, the U.K., and this is defying the GDP. The GDP in Germany, for example, is forecasted in the second quarter at 1.8%, France is 0.4%, Spain is 1%, U.K. is 3.1%. So our guys are outgrowing the GDP. I just think it's the fact that we have had faith in that market. We're seeing our customers didn't go away, continuing to pound Snap-on Value Creation, making them more efficient and, in one of the more efficient places, is developing better products, more innovative products. And that's playing out now that they're seeing even a little sliver of daylight. That's what's working for us there. There's nothing particularly special, I think it's just being in a proper position when a little bit of opportunity presents itself. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from David Leiker from Robert W. Baird. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I just want to follow up on the organic growth. It seems like -- well, it doesn't seem like, we've had an acceleration in the growth rates, the 6.6% across the company. My numbers show that's the best since the first quarter of 2002. Do you think there's something in particular going on this quarter that's behind that? Or do you think this is an inflection higher and a new trend of a higher pace of sales than we've seen the last 2 years? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Look, it's better than a stick in the eye to see the 6.6%, of course. And I'm still sticking to my 4% to 6%. I think we're quite pleased with what we saw in the second quarter. We always know that -- and we're seeing positive trends, what are we, like, 5% in the first quarter and so on. So we're seeing our businesses start to become more effective, and I think there are elements inside these businesses that are working that way. I think as we look forward, I think we expect this kind of trend to continue, but I think 4% to 6% is the right -- are the right numbers. But when you look at these numbers, you feel certainly more encouraged about that 4% to 6%. As I've said on every quarter 2 call I've been on -- and I'm not pre-staging anything up or down -- the third quarter is always squirrely because we've got vacations and so on, where the technicians take vacation. They go to the FSC. They park their van and Europe is off in July and August, depending on where you are. And you'll never know when the distributors are going to come back, and so it's more difficult to predict that. But if I think if you look out over the trend, the quarters, we're going to see -- and I'm not predicting anything bad or -- in that, I'm just saying, there always is more turbulence, more windage in that quarter. Over time, I think this is got to be encouraging to us. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then if we look at the gross profit and the currency headwinds, Aldo, I think, or Nick, I don't remember which one, called out Australia and Canada in particular. Is that shifting from the U.S. into those markets? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: That's what it is. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : The transactional effect, where is that coming from? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Tools Group. And it hits us in 2 places. Those particular currencies, of course, you have translation because we have operations there, and they do okay. And so to the extent the Canadian dollar is smaller and the Australian dollar is weaker, there's an impact on translation both at the sales line and the operating income line. But the big effect was transaction, as you're referencing here, where we sell -- what we're talking about here mostly here in Canada is taking the Tools Group and selling out of the United States factories into those jurisdictions. And so what happens is, you've got a selling price that now is less in U.S. dollars, and so you try to punch it up, but it takes a while to move the selling price up to match that. And so you -- inevitably, when currencies go down, you have transaction effects, and that's what's happening there. The currencies -- where the currencies are now -- there's variations as we go through the year. But where the currencies are now, they -- I think they're about where they were at the end of last year, I think roughly, if you look at all the currencies together. So I don't see any trends for the end of the year, I don't see any changes in that currency position. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : It sounds like you -- a lot of the transactional aspect of those maybe diminishing some, it sounds like you... Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Yes, maybe. I think, look, I think the advantage -- you might be entitled to the following. The -- when you look at the currencies and you start playing out month by month, there's a lot of variations. All I'm saying is when you get to the end of the year, there's a lot less variations from where we are now. So there's -- it goes in and goes out as you go through the year. But from an operating guy point of view, you might be entitled to the idea that if the currency drops, like in Australia and Canada, we'd be trying to push up the pricing to recapture some of that. That's where I -- yes, you would be. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And, I guess, the question is, as we look at it sequentially here, how long does it take for that pricing to start to flow through the numbers? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: I don't know. It's a long -- I can't give you any number. It's like -- you know how this works. Okay, you try to move the pricing up and maybe it doesn't hold so well and so on. So it's not an exact science. You just charge your operating guys with saying, \"Look, let's try to get some of this back.\" It doesn't always work. Sometimes it does work. For example, this time last year, we had a big ding in India, for example, and it took us a long time to get us back up and we're still not back up, but we got some of it back. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then the last item for me is you've done a great job across your businesses. Arguably in those businesses, you're outgrowing your competitors. What are you seeing across, I don't know, a couple of the businesses? Maybe you can do this. What are you seeing the competitive reaction, from your competitors as you guys continue to put up this strong performance? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: I can only tell you what I hear from the people on the ground. And so I was just out at Joliet, where the drag race, we had the Nationals. The NHRA drag race out there, the Nationals, and we hosted 1,200 customers. I talked to a number of them, almost all of them probably. And they didn't mention the competition whatsoever. So I didn't hear anybody say -- hey, I'm not saying people aren't doing stuff. I'm not saying they aren't smart people. I'm not saying they're not aggressive in trying to do things. But what I'm getting feedback from in the operations and at the grassroots are mostly focused on how we can get better, how we can strengthen our position with the customer. It's all about our relationship with the customer. It's almost never \"Oh, I got this competition that's going to bother me.\" It's almost all focused on our relationship. And I think this is the kind of feedback you get from a market leader, of which we are clearly the leader in almost all these segments. Operator : And we'll now take our next question from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : I wanted to ask you -- clearly, you're benefiting from a lot of the innovation that you're taking to market. And I know, historically, there's been sort of a fairly set level of spending on innovation with respect to revenues. So I guess the question is just, what's gating you or limiting you from just accelerating your innovation investment? And where do you think the sort of the point of diminishing marginal returns are on that investment program? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: I don't know. Look, I think what gates it is our own capability. At some level, we're not smart enough to do any more. And so part of it though is, I think -- that's one, and what I mean by that is this : our drive for innovation has to do with our observations in the field. It's not gated by the innovation back here. So in terms of that -- what I mean back here, I mean, at the center, the R&D labs and so on. So what I mean by that is we're gated by how many people for how many hours we have in the workplace. Our R&D spending is up, and it'll fluctuate from time to time, and we spend more in different places. And I guess you would say that over time, we're growing our capability, hiring more engineers. But in my view, the big pacing item is around the unique strategic value that Snap-on has. That is the understanding of the marketplace and the feedback of that understanding into the innovation system that creates these new products. As I talked about today, that tool for the transmission door -- for the power generation door, the transformer door -- that came out of observing how people service transformers. Somebody was there watching and said, \"Boy, we can save a lot of time.\" Or the thing with the springs. Somebody's in the garage watching the springs being unloaded or taken out of the vehicle and watching them fly all over the place, and watching mechanics chase them around. That fed back into, \"Boy, we can make this more productive.\" That's the key, and that's what feeds us. But it\u2019s a unique value and strategic advantage we have, and that's what we're wielding to greater effect now. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : How do you know you're pricing the innovation properly with so much innovation coming down the pipe? How do you explore kind of the upside or the elasticity? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Geez, I don't know. I think we're priced pretty high now. I mean, we think we're up there in terms of pricing. I don't think anybody's ever asked us, \"Are you too shy in your pricing?\" I don't think anybody's thought that. Now you could ask, \"Okay, where do you price it?\" And I think we get that from the field. We have our franchisees, our franchise performance teams that are out there and right -- if you want to take the Tools Group. And with technicians who are out there all the time in the marketplace, and they have a feel for what a tool will sell for. And I think then we kind of price off our own -- our former tool and say, \"How much innovation is this? How much would it be worth for the customer? How flashy will this be?\" And we make a judgment. It's probably not as analytic as you would hope in some orbs, but our position in the marketplace is more an art informed by tremendous understanding of the customer. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Second question, just -- obviously, you've had a lot of success with the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab Express, the TechKnow Van. It's been driving big-ticket sales. It's been driving growth in the Tools segment. But if you exclude those big-ticket storage and diagnostics business, can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of possible acceleration and growth for sockets and wrenches and just the core tool [indiscernible]? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Actually, the sockets and the wrenches are up somewhat higher than the average this quarter. So that's going okay. I think -- yes, the sockets might be up higher, so that's -- so we don't see any diminutization of that, I don't think. I think -- look, I think you could argue that to the extent that we have more innovation and we punch into new areas and come up with more ideas that aren't exactly wrenches and sockets, they become a smaller percentage, of course, but they're no less important. In fact, I was on a van in Encino, California last week. One of our van drivers, Matt Scott, he took me around to a Mercedes dealer and a Tesla dealer where I saw a huge number of Snap-on tools and Snap-on boxes. And a couple of young technicians got on the van. Mark Scott [ph], he had been technician for like 5 years, and Juan Gutierrez [ph] gets on, and he's only 3 years. And they all have like -- they'll say, \"I have 5 or 6 ratchets already, but I need this special low-profile ratchet to get inside this particular product.\" So I think there is no shortage of need for innovative new hand tools, ratchets and sockets and wrenches, even with young technicians, even today, even at a place like Tesla. Operator : And we will now take our next question from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research. Gary F. Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division : Most of my questions have been answered. But, Nick, in terms of what you're doing in the van channel with the Rock 'N Roll vans and the TechKnow vans, have you expanded that outside of the U.S. to other countries where you... Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Yes, we've got about 5 outside the U.S. I don't know -- sometimes when people say \"outside the U.S.,\" we're talking -- I think for purposes of the way you asked the question, yes, 53 of the 58 Rock 'N Roll cabs are inside the United States. We don't have one in Hawaii, I guess. We've got one in Puerto Rico. And we've got 4 or 5 in Canada, we've got 4 in Canada. So, yes, but there haven't been as pushed as far outside the U.S. Canada is -- the routes are broader, so there's a different approach there, I think. You could argue, \"Should they be in the U.K. and Australia?\" And we're looking at that now. Well, maybe there's an opportunity there, I'm not -- we're not sure yet. Operator : And we will now take our next question from Richard Hilgert from Morningstar. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : A couple of questions. First one, looking at the Financial Services balance sheet. We've been expecting the growth rates on the receivables to progressively come down a little bit, because you've grown the base over the last 5 years, and as the company continues to grow, you're adding to that base, but the base is a much larger base. But we've seen here the first couple of quarters of this year that it seems like the growth in financial receivables has accelerated a little bit, and I was curious if there's anything going on there. Aldo J. Pagliari: This is Aldo, Richard. First off, sure, the first half of the year has been a strong beginning for Financial Services, and it reflects -- if you go back over time, the trailing 12-month performance of our big-ticket items is really where the sweet spot for Financial Services does well, and it continues to do so. So we're pleased with that, and we work in concert with the Tools Group to organize programs that call attention both to the tools that we like to feature in the Tools Group and the innovative products that Nick described earlier, as well as programs that we have to make them attractive to the customers of the franchisees -- that is, the mechanics. So our participation rates have been a little bit better. And again, first half of the year has been pretty good for Snap-on Credit. Long way, we continue with the view that, over time, 90-plus percent of what the Financial Services unit does is in support of the Tools Group. And over time, it will reflect the long-term growth rates of that division. So that's still the advice that we give when we model it ourselves internally, and I guess when we talk to people like yourself. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. Looking at the quarterly CapEx. That's, at an absolute level, one of the highest I've seen on a quarterly basis going back over the last 5 years. Are we going to see an acceleration in CapEx going forward beyond the $75 million, $80 million that we're looking at this year? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: No. Look, I don't think so. I think just -- I think we said we were at $70 million to $80 million last quarter, now we said $75 million to $80 million. But this is just -- a few more projects came up that we thought we could invest in. They were talking about the tools factories in the United States, there's some investment in Asia, doing some in Europe and some in R&D or in our places here. I think you're seeing kind of noise in the quarter, and with a maybe slight bias for upward movement. But if I was -- shall I say, if I was a cash flow modeler, for example, I wouldn't be thinking that CapEx is going to explode or get much higher. It'll move up over time, but I'm not thinking we're going to double it or go up by 50% next year, or anything like that. Of course, I'd probably have a big project next quarter that I'll announce, but I don't think so. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Okay. All right. And then on the margins for the quarter being what they are, and Europe still being -- what is it, roughly 20% of overall revenue? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: That's about right. Richard J. Hilgert - Morningstar Inc., Research Division : Yes, any thoughts to -- you've had this target out there of mid-cycle -- or pardon me, mid-teens EBITDA margins. But even with Europe and the softness over there, we've seen it come back this quarter, you're still able to generate an EBIT margin above 16.5%, EBITDA margin slightly ahead of 19%, that's excluding or having Financial Services on an equity basis. Any thoughts to maybe that target of yours moving up a little bit, given the progress you've made, but still having a big chunk of revenues still being slow? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Hey, look. Here's what I think I would say on that, and I think we've said this effect in other orbs. I think we're looking at the mid-teens in the rearview mirror, what we thought was the mid-teens, and so we're by that now. And that doesn't mean we won't have a quarter that's below that, don't -- that doesn't -- I don't mean that every quarter, or anything like that, but I'm talking about the trend. I think we've passed our goal that we set back in, what, 2005 or something like that, when we were back at 6.5% OI margin. We said mid-teens. But what we're saying -- I think we're viewing it going forward, it's not necessarily a target, but I'm telling you that absent macroeconomic turbulence of significance, we see -- we don't see ourselves being interrupted in terms of our growth. We do think that if we never got another dollar of incremental sales, we would be able to increase the margins because of Snap-on Value Creation and its effect on the operations, and there's so much more to improve. And secondly, we do believe though that we're not going to be flat. We think we have ample runways for growth in the van channel with the repair shop owners and managers, with the extending critical industries in emerging markets, and that's going to add leverage to that. So we see our margins continuing to go up at some pace, and we don't necessarily see a near-term ceiling to that. That doesn't mean there isn't a ceiling some place. But we're sitting here [indiscernible], we see that. So I'm not saying we're at a ceiling or anything like that. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Kratcoski. Leslie H. Kratcoski: Great. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly, and, as always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation.",

Baird Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research David MacGregor - Longbow Research Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Operator : Good day and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated, Third Quarter Results Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks Ryan and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's third quarter results, which are detailed in our Press Release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick-off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections, are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks Leslie. Good morning everybody. As usual, I\u2019ll start with the third quarter highlights, provide an update on the environment and speak a bit on the trends. Aldo will then provide a detailed review of the financials. In the third quarter we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement and we saw those gains across all our business segments. Sales were up 7% from last year, 5.6% of acquisition related volume coupled with a 6.2% organic rise. Our operating margin before Financial Services reached 16.2%, up 140 basis points.  When you add the $37.7 million in operating earnings from Financial Services, which increased from $31.6 million in 2013, the consolidated operating margin was 19.6% in EPS. That was $1.76, up $0.33 or 23.1% from the $1.43 registered just last year.  For our automotive related businesses, the environment, it continues to be favorable. Actually it\u2019s been this way for a while and our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group are both well positioned to take advantage. You can see that in the performance; another quarter of solid gains for both groups. Clearly the enhancements to the franchise network and our expansion with dealerships and independent repair shops are driving a continuing positive trend.  In the Commercial & Industrial Group or the C&I Group there was also direct evidence of growing strength. SNA Europe activity increased again, now up three straight quarters. The industrial division, Critical Industries grew by double digits, showing gains in both the U.S. and internationally and the Bellwether emerging markets of China and India, they also registered a quarter of relatively robust progress.  Now as in past periods, C&I does have some headwinds. The European economies are mixed with particular turbulence in the east. The U.S. military somewhat recovered from its prior lows and is still uncertain territory and various Asian countries can be impacted from time to time by local conditions; elections, or changes in economic policies, like the new tax levels in Japan. But you know, there will always be headwinds.  They\u2019ve been a factor in each of our quarters for sometime. They were present again in the third quarter and we overcame, because we are well positioned to confront the challenges and proceed down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding repair shop owners and managers, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets. These do represent avenues for considerable advancement and there has been clear and consistent progress in along each of those paths and the third quarter is more testimony. At the same time those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. These are the processes, the tools we use each and everyday to drive improvement. Our quarterly results, the increases in operating margin demonstrate progress along each of these dimensions, but this quarter, especially in customer connection and innovation. Customer Connection : Snap-on\u2019s continuing pursuit of Repair Shop insight, the understanding of our customers work based on the hours and the days we spend with working men and women.  Innovation: Taking that practical insight and matching it with a keen understanding of what\u2019s made possible by modern technology. Into the quarter those processes resulted in three prestigious product awards, all are evidence of Snap-on bringing it together, the practical with the possible for a good effect.  We were again honored with the MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tools Awards. The winner this time was the Two-Piece, Impact Swivel Extension Set, created to assist technicians to difficult to reach fasteners, like transmission bolts, driveline bolts, cylinder heads. Its laser-welded pivot pin allows for smooth full 30 degrees swivel action and more efficient power transfer. Great for those difficult bolts and heads in tight spaces. It clearly makes critical work easier.  Snap-on also received two Professional Tool & Equipment News Innovation Awards for the Semi-Deep Flip Socket in the Hand Tools category and for our Digital Video Borescope the BK6500 in the Inspection Tools category. Our Flip Socket saves technicians time.  The convenience to using one tool to remove the two most common sizes of underbody fasteners, it speeds up things in the shop, we see it. I\u2019ve mentioned this tool before. The P10 (ph) Award is just another accolade for what has turned out to be a very popular offering and great example of customer connection combining with innovation.  Also recognized by the P10 (ph) was our new BK6500, Digital Video Borescope, offering a true digital image and the largest viewing screen in the market. It diagnoses internal engine problems, inspects door panels, checks for corrosion inside radiators, examines break pad wear and looks inside transmissions and axel housing, all time saving activates.  I mention these awards, because they are just the most recent recognitions of a growing list of popular hit parade products that provide unique customer connection and guided advantages, fueled by the observations of our franchises and direct sales people, all committed to connecting with our professional customers and translating that insight into productivity innovations and Snap-on advantage, and all of that shows in the result of each group in the third quarter.  Now, to focus on those individual groups. Lets start with C&I. Lets start with the Commercial & Industrial Group. Organic sales were up 9.4%, with sales to customers in critical industries leading the way. Operating margins reached 13.7%, up 60 basis points from last years 13.1%, volume growth and the benefits of Snap-on value creation and customer connection had a hand in those results, the C&I results as well.  Our industrial direct salesmen recognized the difficult of torquing large fasteners in the constrain spaces, so common to power generation plants. Our engineering team used this insight to develop or revised torquing process, utilizing a special compact torque wrench configured specifically for closed corners. The new process makes work easier, makes tasks easier for professionals all over the critical power generation industry; courtesy of Snap-on Customer Connection & Innovation.  Speaking of critical industries, broad progress was clearly evident in the quarter. Power generation activity, aerospace volumes, shipments to natural resource customers and sales to the U.S. military, all critical and all up by strong double-digits. Lets talk about the U.S. military for a moment. Entering the year it had been a headwind due to budgetary constrains. But a recent resurgence has caused for guarded optimism. With that said, the availability of future government funding and the timing of order activity remained difficult to predict and so the overall trajectory of military sales is still uncertain, but its been improving. As for SNA Europe, that operation recorded overall gains again. Our fourth straight quarter of growth and it continues its positive trajectory of profitability. Operating margin was up again this quarter, well outpacing volume. Not only leveraging the additional activity, but realizing the benefits of RCI and past restructuring activities. SNA Europe strong. So that provides a bit of color on C&I.  Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales up 6%, significant growth in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income in the quarter of $49.5 million compared to $41.9 million in 2013. Operating income margins of 13.9% rose 130 basis points from last year\u2019s 12.6%. The additional volume, as well as the operating improvements from RCI translated into significant margin gains.  When you consider the root to the Tools Group success, some of it can also be found in the growing power of Snap-on value creation. I\u2019ve spoke often about the Rock N Roll Cab Express vans, enhancing the franchisees sales opportunities through expanded space, so we can display the full range of tool storage products to customers.  If you have been following these calls, you know its been working, and the third quarter was no exception. But beyond the selling assist, the Rock N Roll vans have served as a valuable platform for customer connection. We\u2019ve uncovered a wide of range of tool storage innovations for trim, drawer, colors and other features, all from the interaction on the van.  A recent example is a newly introduced super wide drawer, now installed as a popular option in the epic tool storage line. The idea came from the Rock N Roll Van and now it\u2019s a big seller, helping to stock the Tools Group growth.  Third quarter is also when we hold the Annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, our SFC. This year was in Orlando. More than 8,000 attended. Principals from over 3,000 North American routes and their families and their guests; product showcases, business seminars, new van operating programs, all designed to build franchisees success and in a follow-up survey the franchisees almost unanimously recommended participating in next year\u2019s conference, a great endorsement.  But beyond the formal survey, beyond that survey, I was there myself. I spent time with many franchisees and I believe I have never seen the more positive about their presence or with greater confidence in the future, the Tools Group; awarding winning products, unique mobile demonstration vehicles like the Rock N Roll Express and motivated and committed franchisees. We\u2019ve made it a priority to invest in the franchisee proposition and it\u2019s showing in the third quarter results.  When you speak of the van channel, we also must consider the strategic contributions of Snap-on credit. Our Financial Services arm helps create opportunities across our origination, but especially within the Tools Group. Credit had a strong presence in Orlando at the SFC, supporting franchisees with innovative new programs aimed at enabling sales of those big-ticket items, which are so essential to franchisees success. And if you look at the numbers, Financial Services OI up $6.1 million or 19.3% in the quarter, you know its working. Now lets move to RS&I. Total sales were up 7.3%, 4.4% organically excluding the Pro-Cut acquisition. The operating margin, 23.3% increased from 22.9% last year. The volume gains came primarily from higher sales and essential programs to OEM dealerships and from increases in diagnostics and repair information products, serving independent repair shop owners and mangers.  In the third quarter the RS&I Group, through the Equipment Solutions Division expanded our profile in automotive dealerships with several essential tool programs supporting vehicle launches, putting new models and redesigns or existing platforms. Equipment solutions also provided new essential diagnostics for specific repair campaigns; one designed to identify electrical issues and to other to isolate causes of vibration and noise; new essential programs for dealerships launched in the quarter and helping fuel RS&I growth.  Serving in the independent shops, Mitchell 1 again recorded significant gains with its heavy-duty repair, connect product, securing business with several new key customer networks. Repair Connect provides a complete range of trust repair information and solutions for independent and fleet truck shop and its becoming widely embraced across the heavy-duty market place.  Customer connection also played a large role at RS&I during the quarter. For example, for under car equipment, repair shop insight guided the development of a communicating like between our wheel balancer and customer information networks, unique data such as tread depth and the radial and lateral run out can now be shared directly with the customer\u2019s database. And in the quarter this feature was the deciding factor in converting a large German supplier of wheel logistics to the Snap-on balance of the line up and there are many more similar examples.  We also introduced our most recent acquisitions to international customers at Automechanika, the biannual Automotive Industry event held during September in Frankford. Challenger Lifts were presented at the show for the first time as part of the Snap-on family and it generated broad interest with a wide range of customers from diverse geographies, signaling a new international opportunity for that product line.  Pro-Cut was also introduced at the show as a Snap-on product line, and the audience was attentive and appreciative. We believe it\u2019s a sign of good things to come. So as you can see, there was a lot of initiatives across many end customers, dealerships and independence, domestic and international, all contributions to RS&I gains in serving repair shop owners and mangers.  Well, that\u2019s the highlights of the quarter. Sales up 7%, fueled by significant increases across the board in each group, clear evidence of progress along all our runways for growth. Snap-on value creation, driving improvement, customer connection, innovation, solving critical tasks and offering hit parade products, growth and improvement, brining our OI margin to 16.2%, up 140 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over Aldo. Aldo. Aldo John Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $806.3 million in the quarter increased $53.1 million or 7% from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all of our operating segments. Organically, sales increased 6.2%, excluding $5.6 million of acquisition-related sales and $0.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $393.9 million increased $29.6 million from 2013 levels. The gross margin of 48.9% in the quarter increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from ongoing RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $263.3 million increased $10.3 million, primarily due a higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expenses margin of 32.7% improved 90 basis points from 33.6% a year ago, mainly due to sales volume leverage. Restructuring costs of $2 million in the quarter compared with $1.7 million of such costs last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $130.6 million in the quarter increased $19.3 million or 17.3% and as a percentage of sales improved 140 basis points to 16.2%. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $37.7 million increased 19.3% over prior year levels. Consolidated operating earnings totaled $168.3 million and the operating margin of 19.6% improved to 170 basis points from 17.9% a year ago. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.8% compared with 32.6% last year. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $103.7 million or $1.76 per diluted share compared to net earnings of $84.6 million or $1.43 per share last year, representing a 23.1% increase in earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on slide seven. Sales of $298.8 million in the quarter were up 9.4% organically, primarily reflecting a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries and a single-digit sales increase in our European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $111.8 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 37.4% decreased 70 basis points from 2013 levels, primarily due a shift in sales mix that included higher sales to the military, as well as increased restructuring and other costs.  These year-over-year gross margin impacts were partially offset by savings from ongoing RCI initiatives, including continued improvements within our European based hand tools business.  Operating expenses of $71 million in the quarter increased $2.2 million over 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 23.7% improved 130 basis points, mostly due to the sales volume leverage, including benefits from the higher military sales. As a result of these factors, third quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $40.8 million increased $4.8 million or 13.3% from 2013 levels, and the operating margin of 13.7% improved 60 basis points from 13.1% last year. Turning now to slide eight. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $355 million increased 6% organically, reflecting mid-single-digit sales increases in both our U.S. and international franchise operations.  Gross profit of $154.8 million increased $12 million from 2013 levels and the gross margin of 43.6% increased 80 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $105.3 million in the quarter increased $4.4 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses. The operating expense margin of 29.7% improved 50 basis points from 30.2% last year, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $49.5 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $7.6 million or 18.1% and the operating margin of 13.9% improved 130 basis points from 12.6% last year. Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group shown on slide nine. Sales of $271.2 million increased $18.5 million or 7.3% from 2013 levels. Excluding $5.6 million of acquisition related sales or $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translations, organic sales were up 4.4%. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships and a mid single digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These organic sales increases were partially offset by a low single digit decline in under car equipment sales, largely reflecting continued weakness in Eastern Europe related to demand for big-ticket items.  Gross profit of $127.3 million in the quarter increased $10.6 million over 2013 levels. Gross margin of 46.9% increased 70 basis points as savings from ongoing RCI and other cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and vacillation sales to OEM dealerships. Operating expenses totaled $64 million in the quarter and the operating expense margin of 23.6% increased 30 basis points, generally due to the inclusion of operating expenses for Pro-Cut. Third quarter operating earnings of $63.3 million for the RS&I group increased $5.4 million or 9.3% from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 23.3% in the quarter improved 40 basis points from 22.9% last year. Now turning to slide 10. In the third quarter earnings from Financial Services of $37.7 million and revenues of $53.6 million, compared with operating earnings of $31.6 million on revenue of $45.1 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% compared with 17.4% last year and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.5% compared with 9.6%. Originations of $221.6 million in the quarter increased 8% from 2013 levels. Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extending credit loans to technicians. During the third quarter our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew approximately $39 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $88 million in the quarter increased $3.7 million from comparable 2013 levels, primarily due to higher 2014 net earnings, offset by increased working investment. Net cash used by investing activities of $56.6 million included $35.8 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $22.3 million in the quarter compared with $19.3 million last year. Turning to slide 13. Day sales outstanding for trade and other receivables of 64 days at both the end of the second and third quarters compared with 62 days at 2013 year-end. Inventories increased $50.2 million from 2013 year-end levels, essentially to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions and from the addition of inventories related to Pro-Cut. On a trailing 12-month basis inventory turns of 3.6 compared with 3.7 at the end of the second quarter and 3.8 at 2013 year-end. Our quarter-end cash position of $124.7 million decreased $92.9 million from 2013 year-end levels, largely due to the repayment of $100 million of debt in March of this year. The net decrease in cash also reflects year-to-date impacts of funding, $549.2 million of new finance receivables; dividend payments of $76.8 million, the repurchase of 591,000 shares for $67.5 million, $63.3 million of capital expenditures and the acquisition of Pro-Cut for $41.3 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by $425.1 million of cash from year-to-date collections of finance receivables and $300.7 million of cash from operations. At the end of the third quarter our net debt to capital ratio was 25.9%.  In addition to our $124.7 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At quarter end we had $36.7 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. I'll conclude by mentioning a few outlook items for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect that our full year 2014 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2013 rate of 32.3%, and we continue to anticipate that capital expenditures for the year will be in the range of $75 million to $80 million. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks Aldo. Well, we are encouraged by our third quarter. Sales up 7%; significant activity gains in each of our operating groups. Yes sure, there are headwinds, but that\u2019s nothing new. Our growth trend has passed through turbulence in almost every quarter and we believe the third quarter performance again represents solid evidence of progress along our runways for growth, enhance the franchise channel.  The Tools Group grew at 6% continuing its string of positive gains. Group OI rose 130 basis points and we believe our network of franchisees are growing in strength and confidence. Expanding with our repair shop owners and managers, RS&I grew at 4.4%, had an OI margin of 23.3% and successfully continued the integration of Challenger and Pro-Cut. Extend to critical industries. Organic sales were increased 9.4%. Strong gains in aerospace, oil and gas and the military; SNA Europe sales growing again with profit rising even faster. Build in emerging markets, continuing to strengthen the physicals and seeing it payoff. Progress along our runways for improvements. Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection and RCI offering great new products and improving profitability, driving optical OI margin for the corporation to 16.2%, up 140 basis points. We do believe the quarter\u2019s results are tangible evidence of the abundant opportunities available along our runways for growth and are clear confirmation of the power inherent in Snap-on value creation. We\u2019re encouraged, but we believe there is more, much more and our team is positioned with the capability and the intent to take full advantage and to continue the trajectory of positive performance for the foreseeable future. Now, before I turn to questions its time once again to speak to our franchisees and our associates. I know many of you are listening. The encouraging results of the third quarter and the ongoing favorable trends due to your extraordinary capabilities and your considerable effort. For your contribution to our performance you have my congratulation, and for your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll take our first question from David Leiker with Baird. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Hello David. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: So can we talk Nick or Aldo, just kind of the pace of sales through the quarter and there\u2019s some concern that July and August might have been okay, but September started the slowdown at all. Is there anything you can characterize in terms of what you saw as you moved through the quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Well, we never really characterized the calendarization of our sales, but those who listen to us like you do, those who listen or watch us would know this and that July and August are vacation seasons in the Europe and the United States. For Europe and Northern Europe its July and then August in Southern Europe, so July and August are afflicted by vacations and the same pretty much applies to the van business in the United States, where we have the SSC in August for a reason, because that\u2019s when the guys who are driving the vans want to take a little vacation.  So you might be entitled to the fact that those months might be a little bit more tepid or certainly more variable and then you might be entitled to the fact that in a relatively strong quarter, that quarter would have to be delivered at the end. I think this is kind of logical sense. So without commenting on the week-by-week or day-by-day, I think you can infer that we had a fairly strong end, given that our quarter is so large. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: How much of the strength that your seeing, both on the revenue side and the margin momentum carries over into Q4 and into 2015. Nick Pinchuk : Well, I don\u2019t see anything that interrupts that strength, I\u2019d say that. We never comment on the forward looking months, but I think when I look at our positions along our run rates for growth and the power of our improvement, we see it carrying over the positions with the franchisees. They are more confident than ever before, I said it just a few minutes ago.  You can see the critical industries. The critical industries seem to be humming. Military is coming back, although I did say that can be uncertain, but boy, increases are better than a poke in the eye and its been increasing fairly well, so you see that. RS&I just cranks along and anything in the auto repair business I think is fairly strong at this point. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: And then just the last item on this, what about Europe? Obviously there\u2019s a lot of concern. We talked to a lot of people. Some think Europe might be rolling over. The Europe business has been flat on its back for several years here and just starting to bounce up. Any thoughts on how that might play out? Nick Pinchuk : Well, a couple of things. First of all, certainly we see turbulence in the east like we said for several quarters. We were up again, the fourth straight quarter of growth in Europe and again, they were on vacation in July and August, so this is a fairly \u2013 from that perspective, it was a fairly positive quarter in terms of trajectory, sort of like trajectory. And I will say, our European business is coming off the mat. We are still down 20% to 25%, so we\u2019ve got a long way to get back to where we were in 2008. So I feel okay about Europe at this point. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Okay, and then just one last item here. Aldo in the working capital, looking at the cash flow statement, that\u2019s about a $24 million increase in the use of working capital year-over-year. I don\u2019t think the acquisitions are in there, but can you talk to that a bit. Aldo Pagliari : Certainly. The increase is largely reflective of higher demand plus our intention to provide better service levels to our customer base. At this time you\u2019ll pick up a little bit of a seasonality effect coming out of the Snap-On franchisee conference that you mentioned. It was a pretty well attended conference, pretty good order book and some of the inventory increase reflects that ordering activity. Also accounts receivable are up pretty much the same. 64 days at it was at the end of last quarter, but again that\u2019s tied more to the sales increase. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird: Okay, terrific. Thank you very much. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks David. Bye. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Hey, good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Hey, Aldo I kind of missed your narrative in terms of the sales increases in the RS&I segment, I think \u2013 what did you say, it was high single digit sales to OEM dealerships and low single digit sales to independent repair shops. Aldo Pagliari : No, I think I said it was double-digit sales to OEM dealerships and mid to high single digits in sales of repair information and diagnostic products for the independent shops. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Thanks. All right, hey Nick, I want to just talk obviously Europe and David mentioned this with his questions, but could you tell us exactly how much the sales in Europe were up in the quarter if at all. Nick Pinchuk : Well, the sales, if you are talking about SNA Europe, it was up \u2013 I would say you could characterize it as low single digits. Kind of the same as it was at the last quarter. Although last quarter we would have characterized it as mid single digits, so I mean it was a little bit lower.  But I think when I look at the total that goes in and goes out, we saw some really strong growth in places like Spain and Italy and Denmark and Finland and some weakness in some other places. Europe as always varying from quarter-to-quarter, we think we kind of had the same quarter with volume growth again and leverage on the bottom line that outpaced the growth. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Okay. Although collectively if you put all the European economies together, they are a mess, they are not growing. I mean, is it still a function of that. You are penetrating the market at a greater rate, adding new products, just executing better, is that really what\u2026? Nick Pinchuk : I think that\u2019s it. I mean I think its \u2013 I spend a lot of time of this call trying to emphasize the power of customer connection and innovation by another way, the mechanism by which we generate new products and so in Europe you have new products. For example, in Europe we have something called the Bahco ERGO Tool Management System. A system, which we put in critical applications. The box, which takes care of tool control, is customized to the customer and we put Bahco tools inside. It\u2019s a version of what we do in the United States with the Snap-On brand, only its Bacho and its fitted to each individual customer; that\u2019s driving some of our sales, so individual product improvement is helping.  Secondly, we are just getting better at selling than we were before, because of RCI and our efficiencies and thirdly, I think to be frank here, you know as I said, I think I\u2019ve said on many of these calls, we are coming off a pretty deep dip. We are down 20% to 25%, so you know the world doesn\u2019t have to be that rosy for us to grow.  And so I think you put those three things together and you would say, look we\u2019ve been growing in Europe for several quarters. Four straight quarters now and people have been mourning for a while and we\u2019ve just been growing through those headwinds. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Right. And then could you give us some idea. With the Rock N Roll vans and the TechKnow vans, they are just the U.S. based phenomenon, correct? Nick Pinchuk : Not exclusively, but mostly. To give you an idea for example, this quarter \u2013 I think in the end of the quarter we had like 59 Rock N Roll cabs. I think about five were in the international outside of North America, so there was a few and they grew a couple. One in the United States, one in North America and two in Europe and we have 25 TechKnow Express vans and they are just in the U.S. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Okay. Are there plans to expand the actual physical van count for both of those categories? Nick Pinchuk : Well, there\u2019s certainly a plan to \u2013 the Rock N Roll cab, we\u2019ve got quite a few. I would think international we\u2019d be adding a few more perhaps; we\u2019ll be looking at that. U.S. we\u2019ve got kind of pretty much the nation covered. You might add one or two as you go forward. The TechKnow Express, there are plans to add more as we go forward. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Okay. And just in terms of your best guesses, that on basis points of sales, I mean what would be the incremental contribution from having these vans out there to the Tools Group sales. Nick Pinchuk : Gee, its hard for me to say Gary, because they don\u2019t actually sell, they just promote the product. And so they go out there and are like a rolling showroom and the guy gets on. As you know, he gets on the van. He sees all these tool storage boxes or these diagnostic units and he ends up ordering from the franchisee who is in that territory. So it\u2019s a tough guess to say well, would it have sold anyway?  Certainly what\u2019s happened is, since we\u2019ve had the Rock N Roll cabs for like a couple of years now, tool storage has outpaced the tools group for sometime and our big ticket items again, which is a favorable sign actually, big ticket items outpaced the Tools Group sales in general, and that of course has been driven by this, but I don\u2019t think we have a number. We just know they are helping us. We believe they are paying back. We can afford them because of the 6% growth, the 6% growth this time, the 6.6% last time, the 6.6% the time before that and the drop to 130 basis points improvement. We believe it\u2019s in the mix, but we haven\u2019t worried about payback in general or how much it\u2019s boosting. Sorry, I can\u2019t help you too much. Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research : Well, that\u2019s fine. Thank you very much. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, sure. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor - Longbow Research : Yes, good morning everyone. Great job. Great quarter Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks. David MacGregor - Longbow Research : Yes, outstanding. Nick Pinchuk : We did a great job. David MacGregor - Longbow Research : Yes, everybody really pulled together and it really shows. I guess I had similar questions about franchisee productivity for next year and you\u2019ve had the Rock N Roll cab Express and TechKnow vans.  Clearly financing opportunities have been a facilitator to some degree and of course you\u2019ve had a very strong new product introduction queue. Are there other things driving franchisee productivity into 2015 and maybe can you talk specifically about the extent to which financing opportunities are enhancing franchisee productivity. You talked about it at the conference. There was a strong\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Sure. I mean I can talk about this a little bit. The thing is there\u2019s a number of things. I think first is just general productivity. We\u2019ve got the Rock N Roll van, the TechKnow Express and what they are doing is they are amplifying the power of the space, that\u2019s the van. The van after all is rolling retail space and TechKnow Express and the Rock N Roll cabs are amplifying that on a time-shared basis from route to route and that\u2019s clearly allowed us to reach out for more technicians. You know as I said, we don\u2019t call on all the technicians. We don\u2019t have all the technicians on our sales book at one time in the United States. So we have opportunity to add more, just from those at existing basis, that\u2019s helping. Secondly, it\u2019s a productivity issue, because our guys are real busy and so the idea doing something like RCI, just like a factory. Looking at the van like a factory, figuring how to make work easier for them, ratchet repair for example. Making the ratchet repair more easier is one thing we can do, things like that, how to bounce inventory.  We\u2019ve just rolled out; we\u2019re rolling out and its kind of completing the roll out of a brand new point of sale computer system. We call it chrome. It\u2019s going to help the van drivers\u2019 productivity immensely and then when it comes to finance, finance is just a matter of since its now in the house, the finance programs are tailoring. The credit companies are tailoring their programs just to what the franchisee needs and therefore making it easier for him; one, from an actual point of view and an execution point of view and two, not in substantial, making it easier to understand. We\u2019ve done a lot of work in making these programs easier to understand. I would say four years ago you kind of needed a semi PA. You needed to be an analyst at one of the Wall Street firms or one of the investment firms to be able to understand some of these credit programs, but now it\u2019s a lot easier and so those are the kinds of things we\u2019re doing. David MacGregor - Longbow Research : So when you talked about rolling out a line of new credit programs at the conference this year, were they just easier to understand or was it making credit more available? Nick Pinchuk : Well, easier to understand, one; and two, making credit more available and this way we did a couple of things. One is, we refined our model so that we can think about the actual credit, the actual applicant and better decide whether it\u2019s a good risk or not a risk and want to take the credit. And then look at the franchisee and consider more effectively the franchisees record in choosing and recommending and collecting when making a choice around that, and putting that together in the credit profile and allowing more people to get credit, because the combination of the franchisees endorsement and the credit rating of the individual borrower, the customer made it for a more target rich environment for us, a more informative environment and therefore we were able to do a little bit more activity. David MacGregor - Longbow Research : You are just shifting gears to maybe growth by acquisition. You\u2019re putting some great organic growth numbers. You talked about being willing to go forward and making growth by smaller acquisitions, bolt on acquisitions. Give us a sense of what you see over the next 15 days, maybe 18 months. Nick Pinchuk : We\u2019ve got a long pipeline of possibilities and every quarter we\u2019re acting on, we\u2019re reviewing acquisitions and considering possibilities. Some of them are small, some of them are pretty large I think, but they are all what I would call coherent.  That is, they lie on one of those four runways for growth in terms of enhancing the van channels and expanding repair shop owners and managers, understanding critical industries and other things and so we\u2019ve looked at some really big ones that would ease up a huge portion of our fire power and decided well, maybe that isn\u2019t for us or it isn\u2019t quite \u2013 its only got a very \u2013 not enough of the business fits us and we\u2019ve looked at some smaller ones like Pro-Cut and so on and we pulled the trigger, but we\u2019re looking at them actively all the time. The pipeline, the prospects are fairly large though and it continues to refresh. David MacGregor - Longbow Research : I was just going to say, can you remind us on your priorities. Is there a particular segment your leaning towards or does it \u2013 what should we think about\u2026? Nick Pinchuk : No, the priorities are any of those runways for growth, but as a practical matter, as a practical matter, expanding repair shop owners and managers, giving us something more to sell like Pro-Cut brake lathes or a Challenger Lifts is something that is high priority. Giving us something that would give us more to sell or give us more presence with critical industries is another area that we\u2019d be looking at. Now we would consider emerging markets with the vans, but I think the acquisition targets are less. There\u2019s less available in those areas that fit so coherently in those places. David MacGregor - Longbow Research : Last question is just, across your three segments, where do you still have the most immediate opportunity for RCI? Nick Pinchuk : I\u2019d say C&I, but C&I had an encouraging quarter, 13.7% OI margin. That is the highest OI margin ever by C&I and the last \u2013 we only hit when its high, the highest OI margin and we hit it in the second quarter of 2008. It was on considerably more sales. I think $20 million or $30 million more sales.  So in fact C&I has made a lot of progress and we see more opportunity going for it, but I hate to say that, because to tell you the truth, I think there is ample opportunity in all our businesses. Like I said many times, if we never got another dollar of incremental sales, we would drive the profitability upwards. David MacGregor - Longbow Research : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich Securities. Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. : Thank you. Good morning Nick. Good morning Aldo. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. : Nick, could you give us a sense as with innovation being a big driver of growth, how the pace of hot products have been this year. Nick Pinchuk : Well yes, sure. I hate to, I don\u2019t like to pin myself down, but we are ahead of last year. Last year was a record. I hesitate to say a record, because it was as high as is more than we\u2019ve seen since we\u2019ve been measuring our hit parade products, which by definition, our definition is a product which sells $1 million in the first year after launch. And you might remember that I said last year we hit a level that was lets say between four and five times what we had just in 2006 and we are ahead of last years pace as of now.  Now, of course you got to launch it, its got to sell a $1 million, so who knows. I think there\u2019s some great products in the pipeline, but whether the customers are going to like it or not, I\u2019m not sure. Sometimes I\u2019m not simpatico with the customers, but fortunately the guys who launched the product and design are, so I have confidence that we are ahead. Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. : : Nick Pinchuk : They\u2019ve been strong. We\u2019ve had a good strong year in diagnostics. We just launched a new product, which is rolling out on our service line. It\u2019s got some great new features, faster and having perform more capabilities, bigger screen. It\u2019s incredibly profitability and its incredibly popular, sorry, incredibly popular, and so I am positive about that. Diagnostics is the movement of \u2013 people can relate to the RS&I business because you see the information. You can see the technology and the products. But one thing I want to offer is, when you are talking about critical industries, you are talking about some \u2013 in the C&I side you are talking about some fairly sophisticated items.  I was just down at an aerospace facility, at an aircraft manufacturing and repair facility and I was talking to customers, speaking to customers, because that\u2019s where it\u2019s expanding. I talked to one young technician there, who started to take about low frequency ebbing current; an assessment of structural damage or structural weakness in airplane fuselage. He is one of our customers using our tools and he is talking with great authority about this kind of technology or another different guys talking about magnetic residence to determine weaknesses in the fuselage. So even on an RS&I side, I mean even on the C&I side, in critical industries, you are seeing a tremendous deployment of technology in criticality that gives us opportunity to innovate around that. Liam Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. : Great. Thank you, Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : And we will go next to Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Richard Hilgert - Morningstar : Thanks and good morning everybody, good quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning Richard. Richard Hilgert \u2013 Morningstar: Most of my questions have already been asked, but wanted to visit a little bit about the different between margin expansion from RCI during the quarter versus the improvement that we saw in volume and in areas like the military and over in Europe and especially Europe C&I and in the hand tools side. Can you differentiate there or give us some kind of an idea of what the degree is of margin improvement from both of those. Nick Pinchuk : I kind of resist doing that. If you look at our numbers over time, I kind of view it like this. I kind of view volume leverage and productivity at flat volume as horns on the same goat. You basically get higher sales and you do it with the same people who are slightly less, and it drops through with a great rate, that\u2019s RCI, because you fundamentally enable your people to do more with the same.  Then now other people might call that leverage, but we can consider that RCI if we see reasonable drop through. And the same kind of thing, its sort of the same version, if the sales are flat and we are able to reduce cost, like spend less or maybe use less, do the same kind of support to the tools group, but do it with less cost, let fright for example, less fright cost or less material cost or less design cost, those kinds of things are a positive at flat sales. : Richard Hilgert \u2013 Morningstar: But obviously breakeven has improved bottom line and I look at what EBITDA was five years ago versus where you are at today. We are looking at a 900 basis points improvement from the bottom. So any idea, can you give us some kind of an idea of magnitude on \u2013 has the breakeven improved maybe 100, 200 basis points in your opinion? Nick Pinchuk : You know I again resist it. I don\u2019t think of it in those terms. I really don\u2019t think of it in those terms. I think of it in the terms that I just \u2013 I and the Snap-on team think of it in these terms. We don\u2019t necessarily look back so much. We look forward and say \u2013 and not that we don\u2019t know where we\u2019ve come, but we say to ourselves, look, our task. We sit her now. Our task is to improve next year, improve going forward, and we find components of that and we have programs which will generate savings associated with things like design, cost reduction for products, less material. Maybe a little bit less expensive way to do the same thing with somewhat more quality, we\u2019ll do that or we\u2019ll find ways to enable people on the line to be able to do more.  For example, we will \u2013 I\u2019ve done this myself. We work in a factory and bring down setup times and that will allow more throughput to the factory and more changeovers in the factors, so therefore more throughput and I can do more volume with the same people.  And so we don\u2019t \u2013 and we have a myriad of projects in both those areas, some of them work really well, some of them don\u2019t, but I don\u2019t think we worry ourselves so much about which ones contributed to us. More or less we think about what\u2019s the total result at the end. That\u2019s what\u2019s worked for us for 900 basis points. Richard Hilgert \u2013 Morningstar: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions, and again congrats on the quarter. Nick Pinchuk : All right. Thank you. Operator :  And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks everyone for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly and as always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Have a good day. Thanks. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Pagliari - Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President of Finance Analysts : Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead. Leslie H. Kratcoski: Thanks, Hannah, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter and full year financial results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise statements on management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year. I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the markets and on the progress we've made. Then, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. The results of our fourth quarter were encouraging with sales increases and profit gains across our businesses, continuing our positive trend. We had opportunities, and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities, and we overcame the headwinds. The result was organic sales growth of 9.8%. If we include a $5.7 million contribution from Pro-Cut and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $857.4 million, a rise of 7.5%. Our EPS was $1.97, up 23.1% from the $1.60 in 2013. And that rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.9%, an increase of 140 basis points. Financial service earnings of $42.2 million in the quarter were also up significantly. And the consolidated operating margin, including both Financial Services and opco, reached 20.4%, an improvement of 190 basis points compared to the 18.5% of last year. Looking at our markets. The automotive repair-related segments continue to be favorable, driven of course by expanding and aging car parts and year-after-year technology changes, all driving demand for our product. The Tools Group and the Repair Systems & and Information, or the RS&I, Group took advantage with volume growth by our van network and gains in OEM dealerships in independent repair shops confirming the progress. But we also had opportunities rooted in our expanding capabilities and product lineup for the critical industries and in growing physical strength in emerging markets, areas within the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, arenas that were challenged by a variety of headwinds, fluctuating currencies and macroeconomic turbulence in places like Eastern Europe, Japan, Indonesia and even the core of Western Europe. Despite those challenges, C&I results were quite positive. Higher volumes and favorable trends continued in our Industrial division, progress across a range of critical industries. And in a range of specific operations, the quarter was a period of clear progress, adding to our growing strength in that region. Another feature of the quarter is that military activity was stronger. I think if you've been listening to these calls, all of you know that the critical -- that critical segment has been quite turbulent. In fact, the way forward is still unclear. A significant level of budget uncertainty does remain, and it's difficult to predict the military environment for any extended period. However, in the last quarter, we did make the most of the available opportunities and registered considerable military growth. It added to C&I's positive trend. So to wrap up the broad discussion of the markets, I'd summarize the situation as generally positive across our businesses. And know, we'll always have headwinds. We do believe that no matter what the environment, we have the opportunity and the capability to advance our position. We'll continue to progress against challenges, along our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise channel, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets. That strategic advancement, when coupled with the Snap-on Value Creation Processes of safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, drives a significant and ongoing positive trend or performance. And we believe that the results in the fourth -- first quarter and over the full year show just that. Speaking of the full year, Snap-on's EPS in 2014 was $7.14, an increase of 20.4% from 2013. Driving those earnings was an opco operating margin of 16.3%, up 120 basis points. When we include the income from Financial Services of $149.1 million, which rose $23.4 million, the consolidated operating margin for the year was -- of 19.6%, was up 150 basis points. That performance came on sales of $3.3 billion, a 7.2% year-over-year increase that reflected primarily in organic growth of 6.9%. In 2014, full year gains were achieved from every group. In the Tools Group, a strengthened van channel with organic growth of 7.6% for the year. RS&I expanded reach with repair shop owners and managers, up 4.9% organically. And from the C&I Group, growth in critical industries and progress in emerging markets, organic activity rising 9.5%. All clear evidence of forward movement in the markets we serve. Now let's move to a discussion of the groups and their quarters. In the C&I Group, revenue in the quarter was up 5.3% from 2013 despite unfavorable foreign currency. The organic sales increased 9.9% from broad contributions across the businesses. The Industrial division paced the progress, achieving double-digit gains in multiple critical industries. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a solid mid-single-digit rise, offsetting significant European headwinds, while the Asia/Pacific division recorded higher activity, growing in emerging markets overcoming the present difficulties surrounding Japan. From an earnings perspective, C&I income of $40.5 million, increased $3.4 million compared to the prior year period and that represents an operating margin of 13.6%, a rise of 50 basis points versus 2013. C&I performance in the quarter is exemplified by SNA Europe. As I said, sales gains despite difficulties and profits up sharply, again. RCI practiced over all those difficult days, while the sales were falling. That effort's paying off, and we can see it in the SNA Europe numbers. C&I also advanced in penetrating critical industries. Of particular note, I think, was our gains in power generation, railroads and the oil and gas sectors. And one product line that has gained traction in these areas is our Tools at Height offering, drop prevention systems designed for a variety of industries and used to keep people safe and assets secure. Falling objects is a leading cause of accidents in the workplace. And a 3-pound tool falling from height can make quite an impact. In other words, don't get hit by a falling wrench. It sounds rudimentary, but it's a real workplace issue and a clear opportunity for Snap-on customer connection and innovation to provide unique solutions. By ergonomically tethering our tools, we provide our customers an engineered attachment system, a productive and compliant solution, maintaining the functionalities of tools used at height, but with safety. Guided by customer connection and solving these critical needs on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico or in major power plants in the U.S., our Industrial division's Tools at Height drop prevention system are making work safer and more productive for our customers performing critical tasks. The fourth quarter also grow -- saw a growth in the emerging markets of C&I. China and India led the way for the double-digit growth in our Asia/Pacific division. And it's clear what's driving the progress. Growing physicals, more distributors, more field training, more Asian-ized products, products like our new GLS2P4 [ph] , the compact lift; or our new flexible -- our flexible new i-Aligner system, both ideal for the smaller footprints in Asian shops. And our expanding lineup of Blue-Point tool sets for the rising Asian vehicle repair market. Each quarter, each quarter, we believe we build more Snap-on Asia/Pacific strength, are better poised to continue our positive momentum and improve our position for the considerable repair wave, we believe, is coming in that emerging region. Finally, in C&I. Let me speak a moment about the evolution of our automated tool control system or ATC. You may remember that the ATC, we've spoken on it -- often about it on these calls, is our tool security and inventory management system that uses advanced digital imaging technology and proprietary software to automatically keep track of critical tools. Well in the fourth quarter, the Industrial division reached a milestone. There are now over 1,000 ATC systems deployed and the number's growing. We started out aiming at aviation -- at the aviation industry. But now through customer connection and innovation, we redesigned the product to accommodate the very tool configurations found in the natural resource and railroad industries. ATC systems are now solving problems for customers in both those segments and the momentum is building. ATC, an effective Snap-on concept, extended to more customers, helping drive C&I growth. Now on to the Tools Group, where we posted organic sales increase, an organic sales increase of 11.8%. The operating earnings of $63.9 million, representing a margin rate of 16.5%, up 200 basis points from last year. We often mention Snap-on runways for coherent growth, guiding principles or our long-term sales opportunities, and always prominently included is enhancing the franchise channel. Well the results for the Tools Group in the quarter represent clear validation of the progress being made along that runway. But in addition to the financial performance, there's other evidence that authenticates the achievements. Snap-on continues to be recognized as a franchise of choice. Once again, Snap-on was ranked among the top 25 in Entrepreneur Magazine's list of top-500 franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which measures franchisee satisfaction, recognized Snap-on as a top-50 franchise in its latest ranking, marking the eighth consecutive year we received that award. And again, this quarter, like always, I had the opportunity to meet directly with franchisees at the fall meetings of our U.S. and Canadian National Franchise Advisory Council. And again on our recent kick-off meetings across the country, each of the sessions generated valuable insight, great feedback from an enthusiastic group of franchisees. Based on their optimism, I believe anyone interacting with these professionals would conclude our band network as stronger than ever before. The Tools Group success can also be traced to customer connection and innovation, essential parts of that Snap-on Value Creation. This is the Tools Group's fifth consecutive year for success -- of growth for successful product ideas derived from collaboration efforts with our franchisees, from discussions with technicians or from the independent observations of our associates. An example of that customer connection and innovation is our newly introduced steering rack socket. The accepted technique for replacing of power steering o-rings required removal of the entire power steering rack assembly, followed by the use of a screwdriver and a hammer to change the o-ring. The new Snap-on socket allows the tech to replace the o-ring while the power steering assembly remains in place. It can save a full hour of labor. And it's a winning timesaver, and I can tell you on the van, it's an attention grabber. The steering rack socket is a clear example of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation, moving us down our runways for improvement, providing the means for an ongoing trajectory of positive performance. And the fourth quarter results for the Tools Group, our testimony that it's working. Sales in the fourth quarter were -- moving to RS&I. Moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $282.8 million, organic gains of 6.9%, primarily reflecting stronger software sales in independent dealerships and essential tool activity with OEM dealerships. If you add $5.7 million from our profile acquisition and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, overall reported sales were also up 6.9% in the quarter. Operating earnings of $65.2 million rose $4.4 million, with OI margin improving 10 basis points to 23.1% as the benefits of RCI offset variation in the group's business mix. In the fourth quarter, RCI (sic) [RS&I] sales to vehicle OEMs grew strongly, driven by several essential diagnostic programs, tools for vehicle dealerships. So we grew with OEMs and we grew with independent shops. For the independent shops, Mitchell 1 also registered growth in the quarter, assisted by several multi-site placements of its ProDemand automotive and information product. Mitchell 1 is advancing ProDemand with continuing integration of repair shop information, enhanced navigation and improved mobility. Strengthening the product line and driving volume gains, ProDemand is becoming essential for effective repairs. In the quarter, RCI also -- RS&I also continued the introduction of its newest handheld diagnostic unit, the SOLUS Edge. With an updated processor and easier viewing features, our new SOLUS Edge offers a 50% increase in speed as well as a 15% larger screen size. And as you might expect, it's shaping up to be one of the most successful diagnostic rollouts. Along with our advancements to our handheld hardware, we also continue to enhance our software offering; fewer navigations steps, better user experience, Snap-on diagnostics, simply helping the technicians to fix cars easier and faster. For heavy trucks, our PRO-LINK Ultra, the diagnostic tool continues to enable top-notch service from light diesel to Class A heavy duty trucks. The PRO-LINK delivers the broadest coverage ever available in a single handheld diagnostic tool, including data for major systems like engines and transmissions and ABS brakes and instrument clusters and emissions and body control. It's the ideal tool for heavy duty fleets and dealerships, owner-operator repair shops, municipality and mobile truck services. And as you would expect with those features, sales have been exceptional. Also in the period for RS&I, the equipment division performed quite well. High single-digit organic sales increases bolstered by an improved North American marketplace, gains in Western Europe and innovative new products. Once again, Snap-on Value Creation was on display in the form of the new Snap-on Motorized Wheel Balancer, ideal for shops of all sizes. The new balancer comes equipped with a sonar sensor that eliminates manual measurements of rim width, enabling faster balancing. It also features multiple placement mode, allowing users to flexibly match weight location to a variety of vehicle rims that are so much variety, common today in the car market. And it utilizes Snap-On's Virtual Plane Imaging technology, providing unsurpassed accuracy to ensure an effective balance and a satisfied customer. The new Snap-on authorized balancer : speed, flexibility and accuracy. It's received quite positive reviews, and we anticipate strong sales as the rollout continues. We're very excited about this product. In fact, we're excited about the entire breadth of the RS&I offering. And in November, RS&I presented its full product portfolio at the annual SEAMS show in Las Vegas. The group's equipment business, including Challenger Lifts and Pro-Cut brake lathes, new acquisitions, were featured along with our diagnostics; Mitchell 1, business solutions and equipment solutions product offering, all on display in one booth under the banner \"Snap-on Total Solution.\" Customer reaction was enthusiastic, and our sales for the event were strong. We believe the RS&I group, with state-of-the-art undercar equipment, a strong product line of repair information solutions and award-winning diagnostics products, is capturing an increased presence with shop owners and managers, and the results confirm it. Well, that's our fourth quarter. Opco organic sales rising 9.8%, EPS of $1.97 in the quarter, 23.1% higher than last year, progress registered along all our runways for coherent growth and advancements down each of our runways for improvement, but especially in customer connection and innovation and certainly rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, all of that helping to drive a 16.9% operating margin, up 140 basis points. It clearly was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo J. Pagliari: Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $857.4 million in the quarter increased $59.9 million or 7.5% from 2013 levels, reflecting broad-based gains across all of our operating segments. Organically, sales increased 9.8%, excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $21.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross profit of $411.3 million, increased $32.8 million from 2013 levels. The gross profit margin of 48% in the quarter improved 50 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and benefits from higher sales, partially offset by increased restructuring and other costs. Operating expenses of $266.1 million increased $11.2 million, primarily due to higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 31.1% improved 90 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage. We incurred $1.1 million of restructuring costs in the quarter. There were no restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $145.2 million in the quarter increased $21.6 million or 17.5% compared to the prior year; and as a percentage of sales, improved 140 basis points to 16.9%. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year. The year-over-year increases in both operating earnings and revenue, primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio as well as revenue and earnings from an additional week of operations in 2014. As you may know, Snap-on operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every 6 years. As a result, our 2014 fiscal year contained 53 weeks of operating results, with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-on's consolidated fourth quarter net sales or net earnings, our Financial Services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio. At the consolidated level, the net earnings benefit from the additional week of Financial Services' interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses, primarily personnel-related costs and interest expense. Consolidated operating earnings of $187.4 million in the quarter increased $30.8 million or 19.7%. And the operating margin of 20.4% improved 190 basis points from 18.5% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate was 32.1% in both the fourth quarters of 2014 and 2013. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $116.2 million or $1.97 per diluted share increased $21.7 million or $0.37 per share from 2013 levels, representing a 23.1% increase in diluted earnings per share. For the full year 2014, net earnings of $421.9 million or $7.14 per diluted share increased $71.6 million or $1.21 per share from 2013 levels, representing a 20.4% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the commercial and industrial, or C&I Group, on Slide 7. Sales of $298.2 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, primarily reflecting double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in our Asia/Pacific operations as well as mid-single-digit sales increase in our European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $113.4 million in the quarter. Gross margin of 38% decreased 90 basis points from 2013 levels, primarily due to a shift in sales activity that included higher volume sales to the military and increased sales in our Asia/Pacific operations as well as higher restructuring costs, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $72.9 million in the quarter, decreased $0.3 million from 2013 levels. The operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 140 basis points, primarily due to the sales volume leverage including benefits from the sales shift just mentioned. As a result of these factors, fourth quarter operating earnings for the C&I segment of $40.5 million increased $3.4 million or 9.2% from 2013 levels. And the operating margin of 13.6% improved 50 basis points from 13.1% last year. Turning now to Slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $387.5 million increased 11.8% organically, reflecting a double-digit increase in the United States and a high single-digit gain internationally. Gross profit of $166.4 million increased $20.2 million from 2013 levels. And the gross margin of 42.9% increased 130 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $102.5 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from 2013 levels, primarily due to higher volume-related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 26.4% improved 70 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings of $63.9 million for the Snap-on Tools Group increased $12.9 million or 25.3%. And the operating margin of 16.5% improved 200 basis points from 14.5% last year. Turning to the Repair Systems and Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. Sales of $282.8 million increased 6.9% from 2013 levels. Excluding $5.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales were also up 6.9%, reflecting high single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships as well as a mid-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $131.5 million in the quarter increased $9.5 million from 2013 levels. Gross margin of 46.5% increased 40 basis points, as savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives were partially offset by a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products including increased essential tool and facilitation sales to OEM dealerships. The RS&I Group also incurred higher restructuring costs in the quarter. Operating expenses totaled $66.3 million in the quarter. And the operating expense margin of 23.4% increased 30 basis points, primarily reflecting operating expenses for the Pro-Cut acquisition. Fourth quarter operating earnings of $65.2 million for the RS&I Group increased $4.4 million or 7.2% from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 23.1% increased 10 basis points from 23% last year. Now turning to Slide 10. In the fourth quarter, earnings from Financial Services of $42.2 million and revenues of $59.4 million, including contributions from the additional week of operations in fiscal 2014, compared with operating earnings of $33 million on revenue of $47.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% compared with 17.4% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 6 -- I'm sorry, it's 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $232.2 million in the quarter increased 17.5% from 2013 levels. Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In 2014, our worldwide finance -- Financial Services portfolio grew $152.2 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continued to be in line with our expectations. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $97.2 million in the quarter decreased $25.3 million from comparable 2013 levels as higher net earnings in 2014 were more than offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities, including the timing of estimated tax and other payments, and $10 million of higher discretionary pension plan contributions. Net cash used by investing activities of $46 million included $30.7 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $17.3 million in the quarter compared with $19.9 million last year. Full year capital expenditures totaled $80.6 million. Turning to Slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 62 days at 2013 year-end. Inventories increased $41.1 million from 2013 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions and from the addition of inventories related to Pro-Cut. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.7 compared with 3.8 turns at 2013 year-end. Our year-end cash position of $132.9 million decreased $84.7 million from 2013 year-end levels, largely due to the March 2014 repayment of $100 million of debt at maturity. The net decrease in cash also reflects year-to-date impacts of funding $746.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $107.6 million, $80.6 million for capital expenditures, the repurchase of 680,000 shares for $79.3 million and the acquisition of Pro-Cut for $41.3 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by $591.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $397.9 million of cash from operations. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 26.3% at both 2014 and 2013 year ends. In addition to our $132.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At 2014 year-end, we had $37 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2015. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2015 effective income tax rate will be at or below our full year 2014 rate of 32.1%. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Thanks, Aldo. We believe our fourth quarter and full year results are clear evidence of the abundant opportunities that lie along our strategic runways for growth and of our continuing progress of taking advantage of those possibilities and in achieving amidst challenge and turbulence. The vehicle repair market is both favorable economically and familiar operationally, and we are advancing in that arena. The van channel is being enhanced. The Tools Group is continuing to rise, sales up 11.8%, operating margin increased by 200 basis points. And we believe the franchise -- that franchisee confidence and capability are stronger than ever. We're expanding repair shop owners and managers, profitable growth in dealerships and independent shops, Pro-Cut and Challenger integrated smoothly giving us more to sell, an OI margin of 23.1% and volume growth of 6.9%. We're reaching into new areas for new customers, growing coherently. The extension to critical industry is working. Double-digit growth with those customers in the quarter, 4 straight quarters of robust increases. And we're building firm physical capabilities in emerging markets. Activity in China and in India, up nicely in the quarter. Put that progress together with our with commitment to Snap-on Value Creation, and you will see encouraging results. You see organic sales increases of 9.8% and a margin gain of 140 basis points to 16.9%. In fact, you see our fourth quarter. And as we move forward, we know there are headwinds. We know there are more challenges. But we also believe that our team has unique opportunity rooted in growth and improvement, and has the intent and the capability to continue our positive trend of strategic and financial progress, ensuring that we will exit 2015 stronger than when we entered. Before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I recognize our franchisees and associates, an extraordinary group. Once again, I know many of you are listening. Please know that this encouraging quarter is the result of your effort, for your contributions to our performance, for your support of our team and for your commitment to our future. You have my congratulations, and you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to Hannah for questions. Hannah? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich Securities. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division : Nick, can you give us a little color on how much incremental growth you got from company-supplied vans, like the Rock 'N Roll van, to help supplement the van franchisee effort? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Well -- yes, sure. Look, the Rock 'N Roll vans, as you know, are sort of like a time shared event, which add retail space on a time-sharing basis. Each of the -- each technician, they go around and they visit various technicians for 2 to 3 days. We've grown them from, I think, 18 in the first quarter of 2012, up to around 59 in North America last year. They're not growing anymore. But suffice it to say, that big-ticket items, which tool storage is one of them, was up ahead, greater than the overall Tools Group of 11.8% in the quarter. So they pace the -- they were among the pacing elements -- big-ticket items were among the pacing elements for our growth in the Tools Group. And it's clear that the -- that those 59 in North America, and I think it's 64 international -- in total because we have some in the U.K. now and Australia, have helped drive the way. And of course, that's together with our TechKnow vans, which have increased the same way. The TechKnow vans are now up, I think, to 31, which it started at 14. So those are both helping grow this business. And it has moved faster than at 11.8%. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division : Okay. And on new product introductions or innovation, did you have a good year in terms of hit products and were they divided equally between industrial and automotive? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: I would say we had a good year, yes. I'm pretty positive about the year. We had some really fine new products and the numbers were the like last year. Compared to just, what, 2006, they're several times, as I said many times, that number. And I would say that they are divided, kind of, not quite equally. I'd say the Tools Group gets a little more of those because we have more people really in the workplaces for the automotive repair business, and therefore, those ideas are rolling back with greater frequency. But we are getting a good representation from the industrial business, from the critical industries. And you know, I can offer to you that we've advanced our critical industries, not hit products, but we're expanding that business. For example, we added in the year, 996 new aviation products. We added over 600 oil and gas products, military products over 800, power generation. So we're adding products. They are not all the hit products. I'm not saying that, but we added new products to create excitement in that business. The hit products are those that sell over 1 million and create the excitement. We're getting those in industrial. We're still today getting more out of the vehicle repair side of the business. Still, a very good year for that, I'm very pleased. And in fact, when you look at these numbers, it's hard for you to appreciate it, but I believe very strongly that it's generated by the enthusiasm and the attention-getting that these great new products get when people in the vans or when our salesmen call on customers and say, \"Wow, that's a new product. I'd like to get it,\" and they add other products to it. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : I wanted to start on the organic growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. You were running 6% or so, the last -- the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year. You jumped up to approaching 12% here in Q4, almost double the growth rate. Anything in particular that's behind that? And any sense on how sustainable that kind of a growth rate is going forward? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Yes, I know -- I don't know. I think -- we have been -- you and I have talked about this many times. I mean, the Tools Group numbers, like you say, 11.8%, 6.0%, 6.6%, 6.0%, 10.2%, 9.5%. In fact, the Tools Group now -- the Tools Group has now grown greater -- 5% or greater in, I think, the number 18 of the last 19 quarters. So they've shown some fairly strong performance. And all I can say about it, in general, David -- what I can say first, in general, is that what's happening here is the effect -- the continually increasing effect of understanding how to help the franchisees be more effective, which authored things like the vans, the Rock 'N Roll cab and the TechKnow van. And we're just getting better at bringing out new products and finding those sweet spots in the -- for the customer needs that excite the customers and get that stuff moving off the van. That's what's happening here. Our ability to make the franchisees more productive and effective and the experience that's building in our team to be able to wield this model, which has always been, I've said, the model that fell from Saturn, more effectively. One of the world's great models, those guys in the Tools Group are probably wielding it better than ever before. In this quarter, I think you might say, we had a particularly great customer connection and innovation season, like Liam just add, that's one. And two, we had things like power tools and some great power tool products that came up. I was in a shop the other day, and in fact, Monday -- Tuesday -- sorry, Tuesday, I was in a shop and the technician said, \"Boy, I got this new CT8850, you know, my cordless impact. I used to use these pneumatics. I used to be proud of my pneumatic. Now I've turned my compressor off because this thing is so powerful, I won't let it out of my hand.\" So that was a terrific endorsement of that. He really had gone completely to that new product, and that has driven some of our sales. So you see that. The other thing about the fourth quarter is, we had a particularly great SFC, great SFC. And the tool -- again, this is the experience of the Tools Group guys that are very positive about this. They're very effective in doing this. This is one of the things that I feel about this business, if I can just say this. I think we are on a trend of continual operating improvement. I know there's a lot of discussion about currency. In fact, you can see the numbers there on -- you can see it in our numbers. In the fourth quarter, we got about $20 million worth of translation hit and when you see the K, you'll see a couple of million dollars of profitability hit associated with it. And you never know what the eventual numbers will be because you got a lot of variation in terms of what happens in the marketplace. But we're exposed in places like -- our big exposures are places like the euro, 9% of our sales in the euro and 8% in the pound and then another 5% in the Canada and so on. And we have some drips and drabs around Australia and Japan. But when you -- and the actual number depends on where those -- what activities are each of those markets. So translation and transaction depends on the cocktail of that. But one thing we know is that as we move forward, the rates from the end of the year are moving up more unfavorable. So we'll see headwinds from currency, but we are confident. We know that our operating position will keep improving despite the arithmetic associated with the currency. So things like the Tools Group, the extension of critical industries, 4 straight quarters of high single digits or double digits, those will continue to grow. And we'll exit, as I said in my comments, better in 2015 than when we entered. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : And then just a follow-up on that. If we look at these activities that you're doing with your dealers to improve their productivity, finding ways to push more through the channel, inherently that's somewhat of a barrier. You are creating more and more of a barrier of entry. How is your competition competing with your franchisees changing their business? Are they trying to figure it out? Are they copying what you're doing? What's happening down in the trenches there? Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Well, we have some great guys in the competition. We have some great companies, Stanley and Danaher behind Matco and so on. But at the garage level in the vans, from each of our positions, we see that our franchisees don't often mention the competitors. They reference themselves versus where we have been or where we are going. I just did a van ride, like I said, on Tuesday. And my van driver never mentioned the competitors. He only mentioned how we could get better or how satisfied he was with certain of our new products. So I see this. And I see it across our product line. Our people are confident of our hand tools. Our people are confident of our tool storage because they are beautiful pieces. Our people are confident about our diagnostics and our software because they provide a better insight to repairing the car than ever before. And you know what's happening in the marketplace now, it used to be garages wanted diagnostics. Well with the extension of all the computers on cars, every technician needs to have a diagnostics to repair these days. And so you can see this kind of confidence in our franchisees. And yes, they say, \"Well, I'd rather have this or I need something else.\" But it's always with reference to themselves, it's not much compared to their -- it's not really compared to their competition as much. I hardly ever hear about that. That's not to say, they're not capable and capable people and aggressive people, but when I go out, I hear mostly about ourselves. Operator : Our last question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : You and your organization have built a tremendous compound earnings growth story here, and it's-- it really shows. So congrats on all the progress. I wanted to ask just a couple of questions that are just kind of following up on the earlier questions. And I start with the Tools Group. And you made the observation that you aren't adding any more vans, I guess, on the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab Express. Just looking at the 17.5% origination growth in the finance portfolio suggests that the storage is still a big part of the Tools growth story and the margin, 200 basis points, probably is driven in part by that as well. How do you keep the growth going if you've stopped opening new stores in this enterprise? And maybe talk to that, for starters. Nicholas T. Pinchuk: Well let me say a couple of things. First, just thanks for your compliments about compound earnings growth. But actually, I don't think it's that surprising. This is a great business. It's a great business that has a lot of opportunity and runway further. So we are not so surprised by such things because it is a business that has so much untapped opportunity for both growth and improvement. Let me come back to the idea of keeping it growing. Yes, it is a challenge. But you know that we've grown -- the Tools Group has grown 11.8%, 6%, 6.6%, 6.0%, 10.2%, 9.5% in the subsequent quarters, same-store sales. And then the other thing is, we're getting better at bringing out new products. We just launched another tool storage unit at the kickoffs, David. And you know what it is? It's a tool storage. It's these tool storage, big boxes, you can envision them, and they're gleaming in different colors. They've got great features. You can plug in your power tools and all this stuff, and now we equip them with a downtown sound bar. Now I don't know if you've ever been in a garage, but a sound bar in a tool storage box sounds like a cool thing to me. Everybody who sees them and hears them is going crazy. So new product is a great -- are a great advantage, so that helps it, too. And then the other thing is, we just have to keep thinking of new ways. The Rock 'N Roll Cab was an innovation by the -- brilliant innovation by the Tools Group guys to figure out that they could help the van -- virtually expand the space of the van, which is one of the limitations. They just have to keep coming up with ideas. That doesn't mean that the Rock 'N Roll Cabs won't contribute more. I mean, they've been pretty stable for a fairly long time. I want to say that the vans have been, like, year-over-year -- if you wanted to look at last year at this time, North America had 56 vans, now we have 59. So they only moved up 3 and still it grew at 11.8% in total. And tool storage and big ticket was above that. So they figured out some way to do it without too much increase in sales. Having said that, they also -- we'll be tasking them to come up with new ideas to try to help this situation. The final point is that when you look at the originations versus the Tools Group, it's a little more complex. You have the question of originations and it does -- it is driven by big-ticket items, but it's also a little bit driven by the variation between our sales and the franchisees' sales, of course. The originations track a sale to a technician; our sales track a sale from us to the franchisee. So there's a little bit of timing difference, and it can muddy the water a little bit. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : That's good detail. I guess, the second question I had was, again, following up on a previous question on competition, and you talked about with respect to Stanley and Matco and the others. I wonder if you could just talk about how much competition you're feeling and maybe particularly within the diagnostics business. But how much competition you're feeling from the automotive retailers? And I guess the question really is, as the category... Nicholas T. Pinchuk: What do you mean? What do you mean automotive retailers? Can you define it for me? David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Yes, the AutoZone, Pep Boys, O'Reilly, those guys. I guess my question really is, as that diagnostics category evolves and the technologies that represent, kind of, the foundation of that category become less expensive, how do you respond to protect your great business from price competition, increasing availability? I mean, is it innovation? Is it warranties? Is it credit? Is it support and service? How do you go about... Nicholas T. Pinchuk: I'll tell you what, I tell you what, all of the above, I think. Remember first -- I think, first, that we start with a great product enabled by an extraordinary base of information with, I think, better insight on repair than anybody else. We have a product that will tell you, okay, if you have a make and model and powertrain of a car, and it's a certain model, what the typical repair is on that model based on big data. It's the only one available. And we have an understanding. A lot of the competition comes at the lower end with code readers and so on, a little bit less sophisticated. Technicians are looking for more levels of sophistication. They want to read what the car says. They want to be able to put the car through functional tests, through its paces. They want to be able to reprogram it. They want to be able to see what the OEM says as a standard fix. And then they want the whisper tips and the tips that come out of the big data. We have all of that. Almost no one else does. So our product keeps evolving and getting stronger in that regard. And if anything, the requirements for this gets bigger because it used to be -- the computer content on cars are getting more and more. This is one of the reasons why nobody can repair cars anymore because they're so complicated. And even in garages, you need -- what used to be a situation where you needed one big unit to handle everybody and you could pass it around, well, you can't be working on a car today, in many cases, without these things. So every technician wants one. And so you have that. And then finally, finally, we have our franchisee armed with the TechKnow vans, up close and personal with the technician to help him through the product, tell him what he needs to know, how to use it, and find out what his particular problems are. We have customer connection and customer delivery like no one else has. And so that's why we don't feel so much heat from those other guys. We think this is a robust market that's going to keep growing. We think it's only going to get more demand in this area. And we think we have significant advantages in data, in hardware and in software. And our software business -- our hardware business was strong. We just had a great launch. And our software business was up more than the hardware business in the quarter. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Kratcoski, I'll turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks. Leslie H. Kratcoski: Thanks, Hannah, and to everyone, we appreciate you joining us today. A replay of the call will be available on our website shortly. And as always, we thank you for your interest in Snap-on. Have a good day. Bye. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Good day. And welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated 2015 First Quarter Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks, Jamie, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. You can find a copy of these slides on our website next to the Audio icon for this call. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state -- management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our first quarter and along the way I will give you perspective on our results, our markets and on the progress we've made. Then, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. I believe that our first quarter once again provide a strong evidence of Snap-on advancing along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was a $1.87, up from a $1.62 last year, that rise reflects an opco operating margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points. Combining those opco gains with earnings of $40.3 million from Financial Services brought Snap-on consolidated operating margins to 20.1%, compared to the 18.6% registered last year. Our operating improvement in the quarter came on organic sales growth of 9.9%. Overall, sales in the quarter were $827.8 million, a rise of 5.1% from the prior year and those gains include a significant unfavorable foreign currency translation of $38.5 million or 540 basis points. Now currencies headwind, it was last year, it\u2019s likely to continue throughout the year and if the present rates hold, it will rise somewhat going forward. But we are very encouraged by organic growth in both volume and profitability, and we believe both represent a continuation of our strengthening position and capability and of the generally favorable business environment for each of our operating groups. For us the quarters result a testimony to the abundant opportunity along our runways for growth and of our ability to take advantage as conditions unfold. Like in past quarters, the environment surrounding our Automotive Repair related businesses, the Tools Group and RS&I, Group was generally positive. The changing technologies across the fleet continue to drive the need for new problem-solving products, making those markets robust. In that regard the Tools Group has enhanced our franchise network with van productivity and with innovative marketing taking clear advantage of the favorability to sell more to existing customers and to reach new customers, all on its way to strong growth. At the same time, RS&I is also growing, capitalizing on those positives and utilizing its broader product line to expand repair shop owners and managers. Now C&I, serving customers in critical industries and the most international of our groups does face more variations in the market. Its European operations are confronted with large differences across the business from the relatively calm U.K. to the turbulence in the Middle East to the challenges of Russia to the political uncertainties of newly elected governments in places like India and Indonesia. But it\u2019s in past quarters, the opportunities outweigh those headwinds and when combined with our growing range of customer driven products and with our expanding capabilities aimed specifically at the needs of industries and customers, C&I again showed gains, extending in critical industries and building emerging markets. Besides advancements on our runways for growth, we also made progress on our runways for improvement with Snap-on value creation and safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, our RCI as we call it. RCI has become a part of the fabric, a daily activity at Snap-on. You can see it in the results. OI margin is up and you can see it advance like our annual RCI conference held recently just down the road in Illinois, nearly 400 people, almost 40 best practice teams came together to share ides, buy for awards and celebrate their progress, bringing the learning and enthusiasm back home to the local teams. You can\u2019t help but walk away from these events encouraged and convinced that there's great potential for further improvement. Well, that\u2019s the environment. Of course, as it will always. There are headwinds. Market-to-market variations in difficult macros, but despite the challenges our operations moved significantly along each of our runways for both growth and improvement and you could see it throughout the numbers. Now let's move to the segments, in the C&I Group, organic sales were up 9.8% with contributions coming from our European, U.S. and Asian operations. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $44 million, increased $4.9 million or 12.5% and that represents our margin rate for C&I of 14.8%, an expansion of 130 basis points. SNA Europe again recorded volume growth. This time similar to that achieved by RCI -- by C&I overall, brought gains in many of our markets, led by selling strength and by products that generate real enthusiasm. But SNA Europe improvement in the quarter goes beyond sales growth and far those gains made from past restructuring. Our initiative to improve productivity with focus on both costs and product development are clearly evident in the operations achievements and you can see it again this quarter. Organic sales were up, but profits, profits were up more. Illustrating the power of RCI even in the European environment that remains challenged. Industrial division was also part of the C&I rise. It grew in a number of critical industries, areas like power generation, mining, railroads and the military, as everybody knows, the military sector remains uncertain. But having said that, we have made the most of the opportunities available, this time the opening arose with the changing roles of various units as the troops are redeployed back to the allied states. Actually, that\u2019s a major theme for our first quarter, making the most of the opportunities as they arise mid to turbulence. Another big factor and again in critical industry were expanded product offerings targeted at practical workplace needs. One new example in the recent quarter was the with the PDX series of air drills, ideal for the aviation industry, made in our Murphy, North Carolina plant, these pneumatic drills are using application ranging from light assembly to metalwork, perfect for drilling ferrous and nonferrous metal, plastics and composite materials, the kind of versatility that\u2019s so helpful in aviation application. And the feeterrable trigger provides outstanding control and unparallel run out performance offering great accuracy. Beside utility of the tool, the low sound, low vibration, soft grip and aluminum housing offers maximum comfort with reduced operator fatigue. Another attractive feature in the workplace to ease the professional\u2019s task and enable more consistency throughout the day. These drills are especially usual. One performing important repair work on damaged aircraft still, an application that must be critical in nature. We believe we have another industry winner, the PDX drill, a Superior Aviation tool consistent with Snap-on name. Our industrial division also has driven growth by leveraging the Snap-on RCI experience. Participating in several customer-sponsored lean events right on customer\u2019s side, side-by-side with the customer\u2019s local team. Snap-on people sharing their experiences and insight of rapid continuous, improving, helping customers solve their problems but all the -- problem -- but all the while, gaining deeper practical understanding of the crucial task in critical industries, creating opportunities to tailor our products to the work and to drive more sales. We say we help professionals in solving the critical, RCI is becoming a tool to do just that. Our Asia-Pacific division also posted higher activity, registering progress, building the physicals and limiting the impact of the economic difficulties in Japan. I was just there, attending our annual reseller\u2019s conference this year within C&I in China, bringing together enthusiastic Snap-on associates and resellers from all across the region. New Asian-ized products were introduced. Training seminars were conducted and the group's enthusiasm confirmed our extended opportunities in Asia-Pacific. That\u2019s C&I. Now on with the Tools Group. Organic sales up 12.9%, solid grow in all geographies. The groups operating earnings of $59.8 million represented a margin rate of 15.8%, up 150 basis points for the Tools Group. The results continue to speak for themselves. They clearly demonstrate ongoing progress along one of our runways for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel and there is abundant evidence of the strength of positive trajectory of that channel. It is stated clearly in our franchisee metrics, financial and physical and poor indicators of network health likes sales per band and franchisee turnover. We monitor them closely and they are favorable across the board. In our direct interactions with the franchisees, the meetings like 2015 kickoffs held all over the network earlier in the year. They were marked by -- I can tell you they were marked by enthusiasm and optimism by commitment and energy, gatherings of entrepreneurs and professionals confident in reaching higher. Our Snap-on value creation process, the process is also critical components of the Tools Group progress. Innovative new products, many of these launched from the customer connections we observed on a daily basis. Those solutions, those products are significant players in driving the group\u2019s upward trajectory. An example is the KRL1163 Tool Storage Cab with the power tool organizer system based on customer connections made on our Rock N Roll Express bands. This model transforms the bottom drawer of the box into a customized secure, easy to access storage system for frequently used power tools. It\u2019s a feature that can make technicians work easier. Visitors to our Rock N Roll Cab highlighted the need, our design teams made it a reality, customer connection to innovation to winning product. Speaking of tool storage, this summer marks our 95th year in business. We\u2019ve just launched a special set of tool storage box, highlighting our long tradition of excellence with unique anniversary panel and custom red trim etched with the years, 1920 and 2015. The new units also offer the Snap-on echo remote locking system, another customer connection driven option that we\u2019re confident will be quite popular. These special anniversary boxes are already gathering -- generating considerable excitement on the advance and in the shops. Lots of excitement around these blocks. And we believe there will be strong sellers, clear testimony on the strength of the Snap-on brand and on the bond between Snap-on and professionals. More innovation can be seen on product like the new Snap-on half inch drive 3 six-inch breaker bar, the SHN-36 originally developed from customer connections of the heavy duty mechanics desiring more -- a longer handle for increased leverage. The addition of a soft grip provides added control on comfort and that\u2019s a premium when you're removing tires or adjusting tracks on construction and agricultural equipment, a loosening head bolts on large engine, a much improved product that will make work easier, innovation even on the most established product line. Finally, I want to mention the Tools Group efforts with RCI. Progress, I think, it\u2019s clearly evident in the financials but to double down on a testimony, I spoke before of our annual RCI conference. While a team from Tools was awarded the grand champion at this year's event. The Tools Group rework center for their work on substantially reducing turnaround time, highlighting that at Snap-on. The shop floor has no monopoly on RCI. And illustrating that even an experienced organization like the Tools Group potential RCI opportunities abound up and down throughout and across the business. And we can\u2019t talk about the Tools Group without speaking of its strategic partner about our financial services organization. With each quarters Snap-on Credit becomes more attuned just what programs can best aid our franchisees. And the first quarter demonstrated that progress clearly portfolio growth, profits up over 70% and all the while holding delinquencies to a relatively low level. Snap-on Credit, a greatest historic tools business, and you can see that relationship play out in the positive trend. Now let\u2019s move to RS&I. The first quarter organic sales for RS&I rose 6.3%, broad gains with both OEM dealerships and with independent shops. Operating earnings of $63.9 million were up $5.8 million. The operating margin of 23.5% rose 140 basis points. I\u2019ve spoken often in the past about our line of successful handheld diagnostic units and they continue to drive growth and excitement in the independent repair space. And the first quarter was no exception with our VERUS PRO and MODI\u2019s ultra unit being recognized by undercar digest in this year\u2019s list of top 10 tools, continuing our strength of award-winning products with that publication. Undercar digest bases its selection on the votes of actual users. The award confirms that our handheld diagnostics resonate strongly with professionals. And it demonstrates the power of customer connection and innovation in generating unique productivity solutions. That\u2019s what these stools are about. The VERUS PRO and MODI\u2019s Ultra, they are also key components of our next generation advanced diagnostic work stations, launched in February. These new work stations include handheld diagnostic unit in docking station, a flat screen monitor and accustomed Snap-on tool box. They provide comprehensive diagnostic support to fix cars accurately and quickly and they go a long way in reinforcing the shops images having strong professional capability in the electronics arena, a feature we believe is of significant value to many independent garages as they strive to build customer confidence in this environment of rising vehicle technology. With more than 800 workstation sold since the launch, this is another one of our hit products with over $1 million in first year sales. And it\u2019s another add to our growing track record of innovation success and it\u2019s driving sales progress. Our equipment division also registered gains in the quarter with several national account in part exceeding by highlighting our expanding product bundle, including challenger lifts, Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes as well as the new undercar equipment and broad diagnostic offerings. Snap-on equipment increased productivity for the automotive repair shop networks and advantage rooted in our expanded and enhanced line of products. Finally, we continue to see further progress with our Nexiq heavy-duty and fleet information systems, as well as progress with the improved functionality and comprehensive content contained in Mitchell1\u2019s ProDemand and SureTrack products. All are differentiating offerings that lead to more business. Armed with those products, we achieved a number of multi-location customer wins in the quarter, displacing competitors and gaining traction across the marketplace. Snap-on innovates in the information products, unique database solution, effective navigation systems with speed to repair, all emphasizing our growing strength in vehicle information and they helped drive RS&I sales again this quarter. So that\u2019s the highlights. Significant progress was made in the quarter. Organic sales rise 9.9%, along all our runways for coherent growth. EPS of a $1.87, up 15.4%. Gains achieved through our Snap-on value creation processes, RCI and customer connections especially shinning through, strengthening our business and driving to a 16.7% opco operating margin, up 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I will turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $827.8 million in the quarter were up 9.9% organically, reflecting broad-based growth across all of our operating segments. On a reported basis, net sales including $38.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation increased $40.3 million or 5.1% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations. Largely due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year sales comparisons by approximately 540 basis points. Consolidated gross profit of $410.1 million increased $31.4 million from 2014 levels. The gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 140 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, lower restructuring costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $272.2 million increased $15.2 million, largely due to higher volume related and other expenses, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 32.8% increased 20 basis points from 2014 levels. No restructuring costs were incurred in the first three months of 2015. Last year, we incurred $2 million dollars of restructuring costs. Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, reflecting updated pension plan assumptions for 2015, which include the effects of lower discount rates as well as increased life expectancies. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $137.9 million in the quarter, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $16.2 million from prior year levels and as a percentage of sales improved 120 basis points to 16.7%. Financial Services revenue of $57.4 million in the quarter increased 14.3% from 2014 levels, while operating earnings of $40.3 million increased 17.2%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $178.2 million in the quarter, including $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $22.1 million or 14.2%. And the operating margin of 20.1% improved 150 basis points from 18.6% the year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 32%, compared with 31.6% last year. Finally, net earnings of $110.5 million or a $1.87 per diluted share increased $14.6 million or $0.25 per share, representing a 15.4% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results, starting with the Commercial & Industrial or C&I Group on slide seven. Sales of $297.5 million in the quarter were up 9.8% organically, primarily reflecting similar sales strength both in critical industries and in our European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I group totaled $116.5 million in the quarter and a gross margin of 39.2% improved 40 basis points from 2014 levels, largely due to savings from RCI initiatives primarily in Europe. Operating expenses of $72.5 million in the quarter decreased $1.1 million and the operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 90 basis points, largely due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for C&I segment of $44 million including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels and the operating margin of 14.8% improved 130 basis points. Turning now to slide eight. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $378.2 million increased 12.9% organically, reflecting comparable sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of a $166.3 million increased $18.3 million from 2014 levels and the gross margin of 44% improved 90 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales. Operating expenses of $106.5 million increased $7.7 million from 2014 levels, mostly due to higher volume related expenses. The operating expense margin of 28.2% improved 60 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $59.8 million, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $10.6 million and the operating margin of 15.8% improved 150 basis points. Turning to the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group showed on slide nine. Sales of $272.3 million in the quarter increased 6.3% organically from 2014 levels. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a high single-digit gain and sales of undercar equipment, as well as mid-single-digit gains in both sales to OEM dealerships and the sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $127.3 million increased $9.3 million over 2014 levels and gross margin of 46.8% improved 190 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives and $2 million of lower restructuring costs. Operating expenses totaled $63.4 million in the quarter and operating expense margin of 23.3% increased 50 basis points, largely due to operating expenses of Pro-Cut, which was acquired in May of last year. First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $63.9 million, including $2.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $5.8 million or 10% from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 23.5% improved 140 basis points. Now turning to slide 10. In the first quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $40.3 million on revenue of $57.4 million, compared with operating earnings of $34.4 million on revenue of $50.2 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.7% in the quarter, compared with 17.5% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $230.7 million increased 14.2% from 2014 levels. Moving to slide 11. As of quarter-end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.4 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.2 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $23 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continued to be in line with our expectations. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $78.1 million in the quarter decreased $10.2 million from comparable 2014 levels as higher net earnings in 2015 were more than offset by net increases in operating assets and liabilities, largely as a result of $15 million discretionary domestic pension plan contribution as well as higher tax related payments in the current year. Net cash used by investing activities of $59.5 million included $38.6 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $18.1 million in the quarter were comparable to the prior year. Turning to slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $6.8 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.6 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. Our quarter-end cash position of $114.4 million decreased $18.5 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding $198.8 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 340,000 shares for $49.7 million, dividend payments of $30.9 million, and capital expenditures of $18.1 million. These cash decreases were partially offset by $160.2 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $78.1 million of cash generated from operations, and $22.8 million of cash from a net increase in short-term borrowings. Our net debt-to-cap ratio of 27.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $114 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access commercial paper markets. At first quarter-end, we had $52.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. Now, I will turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. As our first quarter similar to our other quarters, growth and improvement, EPS of $1.87, up 15.4%. Once again, there were headwinds, varying economies, fluctuating currencies, and political unrest, but we overcame by finding and making the most of the opportunities. We made significant progress along our runways for growth, driven by new products and new customers, enhance the band channel. Tools Group organic sales up 12.9%. And we believe the network has never been stronger, expand with repair shop owners and managers, RS&I organic sales up 6.3%. OEM, dealerships, and independent shops capturing new customers with the growing product bundle, extend the critical industries and build in emerging markets. C&I organics sales up 9.8%, SNA Europe progressing against the economic tied, our critical industry team building our understanding of those critical workplaces, launching new products aimed at those tasks and gaining position. Once again, again this quarter we clearly saw the effects of Snap-on value creation, advancing down our runway for improvement. OI margin improvements are more than a 100 basis point in every group and an overall opco margin of 16.7%, an increase of 120 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. We believe it serves as more testimony, great testimony that our business models have the strength, our runways offer the opportunity, and our teams have the capability to continue to trend positive progress as we move forward even amid headwind. Before I turn the call over to the operator, it\u2019s appropriate that I mention our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening today. The encouraging performance of the first quarter and the positive trends are continuing due to your contribution and commitment. For the result you\u2019ve authored, you have my congratulations and for your dedication and support to our team, have my thanks. Now, I will turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research. Tom Hayes : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Tom. Tom Hayes : Just wondering specifically on the C&I Group great organic growth. I was just wondering if there are any industries that maybe outperformed your expectations. And then correlated to that, just wondering about your exposure maybe to oil and gas market as they kind of have some challenges right now? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Look, I expect good news in every market, every quarter I think because we are not -- thing is we are in early days in penetrating critical industry. It\u2019s an aspect of coherent growth that what we\u2019re doing there is duplicating what we have done for automotive repair technicians all these years. We are doing it for other people and other industries you know observing work and making it easier with just the right tools, whether it\u2019s software or hardware. And so an element of that is learning about the industry. So it\u2019s early days. Now we have very industries in there, aviation, the military, oil and gas, power generation, mining. One of the advantages of this is we don\u2019t really have much [indiscernible] in the way of share in these businesses. So therefore each quarter rise and falls not so much on the effect of the industry, just on our own performance. So we have lumpiness from section to section or from industry to industry. In this particular quarter, we actually saw fine performance in places like I said in my power generation, mining, railroad, the military. The military was up this time because we were able to see opportunities. Aviation is a big business in that area. And oil and gas actually was up, even slightly in this quarter. So we saw the usual lumpiness from operation to operation, but the critical industry business really is the driver behind C&I and you see the C&I growth across those segments. So I didn\u2019t see any particular surprises. I guess if you are looking at our business, you might say, ghee, they grew in oil and gas, even though the market was weak. My view was we don\u2019t have that biggest share in oil and gas. Therefore, we can grow against weak markets. Tom Hayes : Okay. Great. Thanks for the color. Just one kind of follow-up question. I was just wondering on the -- how much share repurchase authorization you still have? Aldo Pagliari : We\u2019re having about $215 million. Tom Hayes : Okay. Thank you for the questions. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Liam. How are you doing? Liam Burke : I am fine. Thanks. The organic growth of the Snap-on Tool segment is pretty strong, closer to the high-single digits. A lot higher than more of a mid-single digit expectation, what's driving that incremental growth? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think what\u2019s driving it is, is that the Tools Group team is understanding how to enable the franchisees that we have in various places. We have 4,800 worldwide. We have 3,478, I think in the United States are van. And they are learning quarter-by-quarter how to do it better. And that\u2019s allowing to sell more to same customers and reach other customers, which they had on their routes but they hadn\u2019t been calling on. So the effects of these, I think maybe threefold. One effect is I think we\u2019ve talked about it many times. I think they\u2019re very cleverly breaking through the natural boundaries of that model by adding space with a Rock N' Roll Cabs and you can see it in the progression of the tool storage and breaking through the time by adding a help with things like the TechKnow vans. Now I think, we have 66, 67 of Rock N' Roll -- 66 Rock N' Roll vans throughout the world now and we have now up to 35 TechKnow vans, that\u2019s about four since last quarter. And so you can see breaking that natural boundary is helping. Secondly, Boy, we\u2019re using as much as possible. We using as much as possible our customer connection. We spent a lot of time in the shops and we\u2019re organizing that process and getting that information back into the innovation process and rolling out new products, like that 36-Inch Breaker Bar. People might look at that and say, what\u2019s that? It\u2019s just a long bar. But the idea was -- it wasn\u2019t really available in the marketplace and the ones that were available aren\u2019t as comfortable. Innovation doesn\u2019t have to be earth shattering. It just has to make work easier in this space and the Tools Group is understanding how to do that.  And then thirdly, they\u2019re looking at the franchisee and saying, we know your time is valuable. We\u2019re going to make it better. We\u2019re going to drive RCI into the vans and that\u2019s all resulting in this kind of thing. Their numbers were up 12.8% in the quarter, 12.9% in the quarter, 11.8% the quarter before that, 6% the quarter before that, 6.6% the quarter before that and 6% before that. In fact, 19 of the last 20 quarters, they\u2019ve been 6% or above. And that\u2019s -- what\u2019s driving it all is tuning that business. It\u2019s kind of a -- if you step back and you look at the auto repair you would say, it\u2019s going to go better than GDP. 4% to 6% is what we say. But if you have capability that resonates with those franchisees like they figured out, you would see these kinds of numbers. Liam Burke : And you touched on RCI across all businesses. They were providing incremental profitability along with volume increases. Can you push RCI in a similar fashion to the van channel? Nick Pinchuk : Sure. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re putting RCI into the vans drivers. Now, things like -- I think I\u2019ve mentioned this before on the corporate things like when you repair a ratchet, repairing a ratchet was taking 15 minutes every ratchet. Sometimes, I was on vans where people brought on four ratchets to be repaired at one stop that would have killed the route that day. But we have tools, kind of just like a factory. We are laying it out like a factory, like our van drivers can repair within three or four minutes now and number of things like that, so taking RCI, looking at the van, doing value stream mapping on the van and reducing the time. Adding to their selling time is part of the process, which is allowing them to reach out to more customers. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been doing. Thanks for that question. Liam Burke : Thanks Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Joe Vruwink : Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David. Nick Pinchuk : Hi Joe. Aldo Pagliari : Hey, Joe. Joe Vruwink : Maybe staying with the Tools Group for a second, any products in the catalogue that\u2019s become kind of logical extensions of this recent company-owned van strategy? I should say\u2026. Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t feel so. I think -- not any particular product. I don't think -- I'm sure I could go through launching of new products and find those that came from a company-owned store driver but only around customer connection. We have the van driver itself is the guy or an employee goes out there and he reports back as part and he gives us leads for new tool as part of the company-owned store and that flows back. But we don't really differentiate between a lead from a company-owned store and a franchisees. But in my remarks, you might have heard the whole idea of the power tool draw organizer at the bottom -- at the tool storage box. That came from the Rock 'N Roll Cab and their company stores. They are not selling but their company stores are rolling there. People got on those Rock 'N Roll Cabs and they start talking about boy, wouldn\u2019t it be good if we had a power tool organizer at the bottom in one of these drawers. We got that idea. We gave it to the engineers, they put it in place and we\u2019re rolling out this new product and it\u2019s looking to be a good seller. So that\u2019s an example. I guess the only thing is if you have the company owned stores, they just add the flow of ideas back from the field, the customer connection that comes back from the field. Joe Vruwink : Yeah. So I guess, my question was more oriented towards the Rock 'N Roll Cab and the TechKnow van put really a spotlight on particular things. Is there some extension of that strategy that you can keep rolling out across the Tools Group? Nick Pinchuk : Well, we only have 35 TechKnow vans now. We actually added a couple Rock 'N Roll Cabs in the last quarter, so that\u2019s growing much more slowly. But we added four TechKnow vans, so they may continue to grow some. Whether we add another extension, we may have some ideas but I don't think I'm going to pre-announce them on the call here. I think that\u2019s the magic and the magicians are trying to find out more techniques and activities or programs that would expand the power of the franchisee. See, I think, one of the things, Joe, I just want to point out. Part of the -- really what the Tools Group has done is they figured out that these vans, these franchisee are a great resource, they are better then anybody else. And they figured out how to help them, be more powerful and amplify that power of that rolling retail space and that really capable and committed entrepreneur that's driving it. And we\u2019re going to do more of that, but I\u2019m not about to announce any more of that. Joe Vruwink : Okay. Fair enough. And then switching gears over to the profitability and RS&I this quarter. You call out a few product areas that I would normally think are a bit lower margin within that segment, yet the margins improved year-over-year. Has RCI kind of neutralized thinking about that business in terms of software being sold or equipment being sold from an EBIT margin standpoint? Nick Pinchuk : As I said many times in these calls, our RS&I is the hardest to characterize from a margin perspective. Yes, we had good growth in things like equipments, which tends to be lower margin. But you know, we had a good quarter in software that offset it. Our software is rolling. When I go out and talk to people, they love our diagnostics. In many cases, they\u2019re solving problems three or four times faster than anybody else -- three to four times faster than anybody else and the software is up. So that\u2019s good stuff. Our Mitchell1 Information business and our Diagnostics and Independent Garages are pretty robust. And okay, equipments growing, but those two things are relatively imbalanced. So I don't think we saw a lot of mix in those numbers except for maybe the acquisition might have been there a little. Now the story of 140 basis points in, I think its 140 basis points in RS&I is we had about 50 and 60 of RCI, and we had \u2013 I think we had 70 or 80 of restructuring because last year we had a big restructuring dial up in there. So that\u2019s how you can kind of way you look at that. But still a pretty big dial up of RCI, plus you don\u2019t want to no mistake about this even though the equipment the lower margin business are growing so as the software. Joe Vruwink : Okay. Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Good morning, everybody. Nick Pinchuk : Hi, Garry. Aldo Pagliari : Hi, Garry. Gary Prestopino : Good. All right. Nick, it\u2019s the inevitable question on margins and just looking at the gross margin, I think that gross margin you reported in Q1 was probably the highest that it\u2019s been for quite some time? And I was just wondering if there were something in there that got it about 49% or is -- one time deal or are we at a new kind of sustainable level here, so if you could directly you could talk about that? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Look, I don\u2019t -- we don\u2019t spend a lot of time agonizing over the difference between gross margin and OE, I kind of test the operations to drive their operating income and I tend to focus on that much more. And what we said is, is that, we believe that we have both run ways for growth and improvement that accrues operating income and from quarter-to-quarter they accrue, those two things accrue in different proportion between gross margin and operating expense. So I wouldn\u2019t call the gross margin necessarily breakthrough, but there\u2019s nothing special in there this quarter. So there is nothing really -- there\u2019s no real -- I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any real onetime event or anything like that. Really I mean you saw you saw our currency numbers in the quarter I think you, our sales were -- what was it 38.5% in currency and about 6.9% in OI and we are -- we have currency headwinds one of the current rate stays the same those will rise. But on the other hand we believe that that's sort of arithmetic, well, we are so enthusiastic about our operating opportunities and you can see it in this quarter the operating opportunities worked out. Currencies are going to go up and down, but the operating gains are going to stay with us forever and we view the 16.7% as being part of that. Gary Prestopino : Okay. That's fair. And then Europe I\u2019ve been reading that new car registrations are up? It seems that Europe starting to get some traction? And I think you said your European hand tools business topline was up commensurate with C&I? So -- the cadence has been that you\u2019ve moved on a quarterly basis over the last couple of quarters from low single-digit to mid single-digit to high single-digit growth in the\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : It hasn\u2019t been that -- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been that thinking about it back here, I have to go back and look it. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been that sort of straight lines, but if you looked that it over say like eight quarters or something like that you probably see some kind of movement. I think what happens this order is basically some of our activities are paying off associated with new product development. We do have some new products that are exciting the customers you can create enthusiasm even in what I consider to be a relatively dead market in Europe. New car sales usually doesn\u2019t help us that much, except for the fact that, except for the broader fact that new car sales probably accompanying a more positive economy. It is true though that we made -- I think encouraging gains in selling in Europe. We -- France and Germany which had been a drag in the last couple of quarters. In fact they were down in the last couple of quarters, they were up this quarter and we continued with the Nordic countries and we had some business in Turkey, of course, Eastern Europe was week, so and Spain was up off of a relatively low base. So we kind of saw -- we kind of saw the same progress in Europe that we\u2019ve seen in other quarters, except we started making progress in France and Germany. Eastern Europe is kind of dead right now and Russia is difficult so on. So that\u2019s kind of -- so I guess you could be entitled for the idea, Europe got a somewhat better. But profits were even better, very strong performance because of the effects of RCI. Gary Prestopino : That's great news. And then lastly, as I just look at this, the reported revenues and the unfavourable currency translation, if I add back the impact of currency translation and then say you had about 25% of your sales are based internationally. Is that correct? Nick Pinchuk : A little more than that. I think it\u2019s -- let me see I think it\u2019s about, what is it like 35%, yes 35% is international. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Because I was getting -- I was getting a currency hit of somewhere between 17% drag on the numbers from a 25% contributions, so it\u2019s 35%, it\u2019s still going to be about 10% to 12% hit. And I am just wondering were the -- was the euro down that much that it caused that kind of drag on the numbers, or is my math wrong? Nick Pinchuk : The euro was down. We have several currencies that impact us on a translation basis. You\u2019ve got -- first of all, you got the euro and then you got the pound and then you\u2019ve got the Canadian dollar. If you look at that and actually when I said 35%, it\u2019s -- I was embracing our northern neighbours here and I was using Canada. If you just look at the United States, talk about, maybe think of Canada, it\u2019s international which is somehow I don\u2019t really always, it\u2019s 40% outside the United States, so Canada is in there. So you see those kinds of variations. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Nick Pinchuk : I mean, basically, one of those companies that is in current -- we are affected by currency, but we have some good -- some reasonable natural hedges from transaction because we tend to make in the markets where we sell. Gary Prestopino : Right. That's the next question I was going to get to. You have those natural hedges, so... Nick Pinchuk : No, not in everything, but we are not immune. Certain like this we are currency resistant from a transaction point of view, but we are not immune. So we don\u2019t bring our hands over it. We see it coming like I said clearly we had currency -- we had currency last year actually. We\u2019ve got it this year. If the rates stay where they or rise some, but it doesn\u2019t affect our operating activity because we know that that 16.7% is going to stay with us, that 12.9% is going to stay with us, that 9.8% is going to stay with us. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you very much. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Richard Hilgert : Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, everybody. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning, Richard. Richard Hilgert : I was looking at the currency impact a little bit differently. I added back the currency impacts to each one of the revenues for each of the groups, and then also added back the negative impact for currency for each one of their operating results. Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Richard Hilgert : The year-over-year increase or expansion in margin, excluding currency, was 140 basis points. When I did all those add backs, I came up with an expansion that was just about 10 basis points less than that at about 130, which is still a fantastic performance. But I'm curious, is that because -- correct me if I am wrong, but isn\u2019t C&I a little bit more of the mix when you add back the currencies and that's why the expansion wasn't quite as much when you take into consideration the currency? Nick Pinchuk : I\u2019ll tell you this. I\u2019ll tell you this is that in our numbers 120 basis points for our calculation, no effective currency in that 120. In other words, it all balances out at the corporate level. At the corporate level, it all balances out. So we don't really -- at a margin level, at a margin rate level. So the 16.7% from our perspective is basically all RCI, it\u2019s pretty much \u2013 it\u2019s got bad news from pension, it\u2019s got bad news from pension and so on, and it\u2019s primarily RCI and volume productivity. Richard Hilgert : Yes. No matter how you slice it, it\u2019s still a great performance. Nick Pinchuk : It\u2019s got a little bit of restructuring good news, offsetting pension and the rest is productivity, currency doesn\u2019t come in there. But if you go by the various groups, C&I it\u2019s helped a little bit on the margin rate basis, not on an absolute basis by currency. Tools Group being, Tools Group would -- if they didn\u2019t have currency, Tools Group would be much more -- it would have been more than 150 basis points. And our C&I a little bit of currency. But that\u2019s way it kind of works out. Richard Hilgert : Okay. And then on the hand tools side, since we\u2019ve had improving economic conditions for the last three, four years now, have you see an increase in the number of garages opening up in the United States. Is that all sold out? Nick Pinchuk : No. Technician population is probably growing at about 1.3% for government work that would be the number. But the garages, in fact, if anything, if anything actually, depending how far back you go, the dealerships have shrunk. I think the dealerships were about 21,000 before recession, now that it\u2019s 17 or 18. So they have shrunk. The independents have stayed about the same. The independent have taken more share since that\u2019s started before the recession. That seems to may be, now this state always trail. So that\u2019s kind of levelled off a lot of people think now. But I think there hasn\u2019t been a big change in the characteristics, except the independents are becoming more sophisticated, because they have the deal with the changing technologies. 20 years ago there were 50 engines codes on a car, now there is 5,000 engine codes. It\u2019s hard to fix the car without the diagnostic unit now, and we have the best one. And so we are selling them to technicians now, not just the garages and so that\u2019s helping drive our business. So that technology change in the independent space, that\u2019s why we talked about the diagnostic workstation because the independent garages know that people know their cars are more like spaceships these days. And they want to bring them to people who could fix and therefore this diagnostic unit makes it look like wow, this is big computer unit that can fix the car, helps fix the car and it grows confidence. And actually, it helps in terms of accuracy. So, if anything, we\u2019re seeing a greater demand of our product in the independent shops and other shops because of the change in technology, that\u2019s\u2019 the big change. Richard Hilgert : Okay. Great. And then with respect to your comments about Europe and new car sales in what that means, in terms of hand tool sales over there. Just noticing Western Europe trailing 12 months, new car sales are up about 6%, Eastern Europe however, those, is up about 10%. They were up as much as 15% back about, around the third quarter of last year. But that growth rate is kind of steadily got down a bit. They are still tracking year-over-year increases. So I\u2019m kind of curious, it makes sense that France and Germany, you\u2019re doing better. The industry is doing better in general in those two countries. But I'm surprised that the Eastern Europe hasn\u2019t really kept up with the expansion of the new-car demand, any comments about that? Nick Pinchuk : The new car demand is down in Eastern Europe, right. Richard Hilgert : No. I mean, it\u2019s still up. Nick Pinchuk : It\u2019s still up. But for us new cars don\u2019t matter. I mean, I think, I\u2019ve said that, because the new car sales are almost always -- except in emerging markets place like China and India so on. There is almost always small compared to the installed base to the car part. Consider the U.S. $16 million cars, North America, 17 million 18 million cars sold. There is a 300 million on the road. It\u2019s like a fly spec almost, the new cars, compared to those on the roads So doesn\u2019t really move our business that much up and down and sort of a shortly basis. In terms of Eastern Europe, I think, I would just suggest you that I'm not really sure what\u2019s going on in the Eastern Europe, it\u2019s a cocktail of different countries. So it\u2019s really hard to say, I mean, you see Russia being so weak. On the other hand, our business is up in Poland, for example, if you include that in Eastern Europe. Richard Hilgert : Yeah. I do. Nick Pinchuk : So it\u2019s hard to make much prediction about that. I think this is just one of those turbulent things that where traditional economics don't always work in every period. Richard Hilgert : Okay. And just for clarification on new car sales, it would impact you from the perspective of the new diagnostics in the new tools that have to come out of the service new vehicle, right? Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Richard Hilgert : Okay. Nick Pinchuk : But that\u2019s a longer wave event. In other words, you\u2019re right, Richard, but the next year isn\u2019t that much different. It changes some, and so people need to adjust for that. But these things work through over time. I was reacting to the idea that people say while new car sales were up in the first quarter therefore your business is going to be better. I don\u2019t think so. It doesn\u2019t affect us that much. Richard Hilgert : .: Nick Pinchuk : It\u2019s much longer. Richard Hilgert : And the last question for Aldo. The financial services business, the receivables debt year-over-year keeps growing at the low double-digit numbers, despite the lower revenue on the single-digit numbers. Any comments on how come we\u2019re still seeing so much more growth, I thought that the financial services business was pretty much penetrated for being a captive now? Aldo Pagliari : Richard, just to remind you, most of the activity in financial services actually about 94% to 95% of, it really reflects activity in the Snap-on Tools Group. So if you look at on Snap-on Tools Group performance, again it was, I think, organically 12 plus percent, 12.9%. And I think, what you\u2019re seeing when you look at the originations of 14.2 on the topline for full year growth, you seeing it really reflective of the Tools Group and the Financial Services penetration of their sale of not just big-ticket items, but a variety of the product that they sell. So overtime it will mirror that and I think if you look back, it\u2019s rather consistent with Tools Groups performance over the last several quarters. Richard Hilgert : Okay. Are they doing more in RS&I at this point? Aldo Pagliari : Above the same level. I mean, we are growing with RS&I at about the same level. The biggest different has been the reflection of the Tools Group. Richard Hilgert : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. Aldo Pagliari : Take care. Operator : And there are no more questions over the phone. So at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to our host for any additional or closing remarks. Leslie Kratcoski : Great. Thanks everyone for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly and as always we thank you for your interest in Snap-on. Good day.",

Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research Operator : Please stand by, we're about to begin. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Snap-on, Inc. 2015 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead, ma'am. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Finance Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion.

Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I'll start this call with some highlights of our second quarter. I'll speak about the general environment and about the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made. Then, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. Our second quarter results were encouraging. We believe they once again offer strong evidence of clear Snap-on advancements along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Organic sales were up 8.4% from last year. The operating margin expanded by 100 basis points. And earnings per share, they reached $2.03, up 12.8% compared with the $1.80 reported last year. Our reported sales increase was 3.1%. That total includes the continuing weight of unfavorable foreign currency translations this quarter, an impact of $43.4 million. Including the incremental $2.8 million from last year's Pro-Cut acquisition, our total reported sales for the period \u2013 our sales for the period were $851.8 million. The opco operating margin reached 17.7%, up from 16.7% in 2014; and as I said, representing 100 basis points increase, more than offsetting the 40 basis point impact on profit from unfavorable currency. Financial Services operating income grew to $41.4 million from last year's $34.8 million, driving our consolidating operating margins, financial services plus opco to 21.1%, higher by 140 basis points. It wasn't our encouraging quarter. From an overall macro perspective, we believe the conditions remain favorable for our businesses serving automotive repair customers, the businesses like the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information, our RS&I Group. In the second quarter, the Tools Group organic activity increased 11.2%. The tailwinds of changing vehicle technology and the ageing of the fleet continue to provide opportunity. And the rising strength of our van network and our robust continuing line of new products, they enabled Snap-on to take greater advantage of those tailwinds and clear \u2013 and it's clearly evidenced in the numbers. In RS&I, they had organic gains of 3.3%, led by higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, increased sales to OEM dealerships, and higher sales of undercar equipment; all serving to offset the particular challenges in Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, where that Group had made particular progress in prior periods. For the Commercial & Industrial, C&I, there are also continued signs of advancement. Organic sales up 11.2% in the quarter. And for C&I, along our runways for growth, we saw important and clear headway; headway in our efforts to extend into critical industries, in our European business, and in several emerging markets. That progress was one against pockets of turbulence in geographies like Europe where the uncertainty of Greece looms; in places like Japan, where recovery is sporadic; and in the U.S. military. U.S. military has been a somewhat unpredictable sector. Well, in the second quarter, U.S. military activity experience for Snap-on, another strong period, up double-digits from last year. However, we do remain cautious on the military business there. This is a period of uncertainty. Changing deployments and budget pressure, make it difficult to predict the future trajectory of that business with any confidence. But having said that, having said that, we believe we're well positioned in the military sector to make the most of any available opportunities, any available openings. Overall, the C&I results are quite positive. The opportunity is definitely outweighing the challenges and the results they confirm it. More broadly, for the whole operation, for the whole of Snap-on. The operating income gains across the corporation clearly demonstrate the leverage and the power of the Snap-on value creation processes. Safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, they all drive our improvement every day; and they help to offer 100 basis point gain in the quarter, overcoming the significant challenges. Now, let's highlight some of the advancements in growth and in improvement demonstrated by the individual groups. We'll start with C&I. As I just said, an 11.2% organic sales gain, and that follows a 9.8% organic sales gain in the first quarter. C&I's operating income margin was 14.3%, up 100 basis points, both the higher volume and the benefits of Snap-on value creation drove that raise. And there were some very positive volume gains. SNA Europe registered its seventh straight quarter of year-over-year growth, a promising trend, outperforming the storm clouds that occupied the headlines of Europe. The industrial division saw particularly strong activity in the aviation sector, a key area of our focus in extending to critical industries. Some of those aerospace gains can be attributed to our growing line of innovative new products specifically aimed at that industry, products like our new array of aircraft tire gauges and inflators. When it comes to aircraft tires and struts, proper measurement and inflation are key for safe takeoffs and landing as well as for breaking predictability and effectiveness. We talk about critical industries, those sound kind of critical for people who travel. Raising the bar in that arena our new line of 300 PSI analog and digital tire gauges offer improved accuracy. Our approval for hazardous environments incorporate a reflective glow dial or a backlit display. It makes \u2013 they make the technicians' work more effective, safer and easier meeting all type of challenges in all types of conditions. Also in the quarter and aimed right at aviation, we introduced the new Snap-on Electro Static Discharge-Safe Precision Pliers. They're designed for use on static-sensitive components in circuitry, with a specifically designed handle to dissipate electricity, improved squeezing torque control and a low profile design for greater accessibility than the standard pliers, all features that are valued by professionals, performing those critical aviation tasks. The 300 PSI tire gauges and static discharge safe pliers, innovative new product, adding to our growing aerospace offering and clearly demonstrating our efforts to roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage to extend into critical industries like aviation. And the second quarter results, they confirm that it's working. Now, let's speak about SNA Europe. Our European hand tool \u2013 our European-based hand tool business. SNA Europe, broad organic growth and gains in the period, up mid single-digits, growth in Spain, United Kingdom and in the Nordic region. And besides that volume rise, SNA Europe continued its trajectory of operating margin improving, leveraging the additional sales, but also realizing the benefits of RCI and Snap-on value creation against a backdrop of substantial Euroland turbulence. SNA Europe, sales up for the seventh straight quarter, but once again, profits up more. And we're also continuing to build in emerging markets. Asia-Pacific was another contributor to C&I growth. Activity up in relatively uneven markets like Korea and Indonesia. C&I did have an encouraging quarter, but we know there's still more opportunity; opportunity to continue building on the momentum generated by our European operations, to strengthen our position within emerging markets, and to proceed forward down our runways of critical industries extending to even more customers. Now, let's move to the Tools Group. Sales were up 11.2% organically with double-digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin, up 17.1%, up 70 basis points versus the 16.4% recorded last year and overcoming within the quarter 120 basis points of unfavorable currency impact. That 70 basis point improvement brings our Tools Group OI margin to new levels, and that margin performance clearly speaks to our improving position. And when combined with the growth this quarter, demonstrates the success we're having on this decisive runway, enhancing the franchise network. You can see it in the sales and you can see it in the overall franchise health metrics, trending positively again this quarter. Snap-on franchisees are a committed and capable group and you're convinced of that every time you meet one of them. And we're working hard every day to support their effort through creative marketing, access to in-house customer financing with Snap-on Credit, and a growing array of innovative new products. Products like our new ratcheting combination wrenches with an innovative design, higher strength and enhanced durability. Our new ratcheting gear design safely delivers 25% more torque and 95% longer fatigue life; innovative Snap-on technology enabling the transfer of more power in a thinner, smaller diameter wrench head helping to access and remove the most stubborn of fasteners in tight, tight spaces. The Dual 80 design with an 80 tooth ratcheting gear and dual pawls minimizes the swing arc that's needed to move fasteners. A great enabler, a great enabler in the engine compartments of today's vehicles. And, of course, the new wrench features our unique Flank Drive wrenching system that consistently minimizes fastener damage. Snap-on's new line of combination wrenches raises the bar for professionals in performing critical and difficult tasks. It's a winning tool line on an existing product platform, a direct result of Snap-on value creation shaped by customer connections, direct observations in the shop, and delivered by the Snap-on innovation process. It's already generating excitement in the repair shops all over this country and there's more to come. Now, the growing strength of our van network \u2013 our rolling selling space, it's what the van network is \u2013 is evident with the increases in big ticket sales. And a considerable boost comes from our hands-on demonstration vehicles like the Rock N' Roll Cab Express vans, 66 of them, bringing a much wider range of our tool storage line-ups directly to the shop, more colors, more shapes, more options and more choices displayed across our customer base. And if you've been listening to these calls for anytime, you've heard the story of this innovative marketing initiative, the Rock N' Roll van, expanding our van selling space. And they continue to be a significant contributor to the Tools Group. In the quarter, big ticket sales were up strong double-digits and our demonstration vans were a big driver. But those vans weren't the only factor, big ticket gains were also propelled by new two storage products; winning offerings like our special edition 95th anniversary box, another in a long line of our customized tools storage systems. We mentioned them, I think, on the last quarter's call and they've been popular. Technicians upgrading their workspace, celebrating our milestone year, and providing clear testimony to the strength of the Snap-on brand positioned in shops all around the world. Another key advantage for the Tools Group is our Financial Services on Snap-on Credit, strategic programs aimed at smoothing the way for those big ticket purchases. Our credit company plays an essential role in enhancing the van network, and again this quarter, it did just that. Well, that's the Tools Group, attractive new products guided by customer connection, innovation marketing and a unique credit facility, all increasing the power of the Snap-on van channel and driving sales to new levels. Now on to RS&I, organic sales growth of $8.7 million or 3.3%. The second quarter operating margin, 24.4%, rising 120 basis points compared to last year's 23.2%. Margin expansion, another demonstration of RCI in Snap-on value creation. The organic sales gain was broad-based, the diagnostics and information businesses selling to independent repair shop owners and managers with a mid single-digit gain in volume helped by new products. Products like the ETHOS Tech, our newest diagnostic handheld offering, aimed \u2013 is aimed at individual shop technicians and first-time diagnostic buyers. The ETHOS Tech is a full function scan tool with a quick boot-up, streamlined interface, a large color screen, and full comprehensive coverage of car makes and vehicle systems, all the features that are so important even for the entry level technician in today's environment where vehicle diagnostics are becoming essential for everyday maintenance as well as complex repair. More technicians than ever before will be using diagnostics in almost every job and ETHOS Tech is a great way for them to get started. Also in the quarter RS&I released its latest software update for our PRO-LINK Ultra, supplying truck shops with even broader diagnostic data covering both diesel and larger gasoline engines. The PRO-LINK Ultra, it's capable of diagnosing commercial vehicles from light diesel to Class 8 heavy-duty trucks. It delivers the widest coverage ever available in \u2013 at a single handheld diagnostic tool, including data for major vehicle system. It's a great enabler for the \u2013 it's a great enabler that, I guess, quite simply provides heavy-duty technicians with the range of diagnostic information now necessary to perform their daily task. And it's becoming the choice across the heavy-duty sector. Equipment division registered a low single digit organic sales rise, overcoming the turbulence in Eastern Europe. Some of those gains were offered by our new aligner, the V2400 launched just this period. The V2400 designed for premium OEM dealerships and for high-end wheel service shops, places that require advanced alignment techniques. It offers increased accuracy and repeatability, higher resolution cameras that produce live alignment and diagnostic data, passive lightweight front and rear targets that improve durability, and advanced dimensioning that identifies frame or structural damage or mismatched tire sizes; a regular cause of vehicle pulling or driver complaint, all of those are features that aid greatly in technician productivity. We believe we have an exceptional product in this next-generation aligner and early returns indicates that our customers are saying the same thing. Speaking about the equipment division, May marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of the Pro-Cut on-car brake lathes. We're excited to have Pro-Cut as part of the team. When we put Pro-Cut advanced brake servicing product line \u2013 Pro-Cut advanced brake servicing product line together with another recent add, Challenger Lifts, it gives us more to sell to vehicle repair shop owners and managers, to customers in independent shops, national service chains, and OEM dealerships. And when packaged along with our other established RS&I products, Snap-on now offers a wider range of shop solutions than ever before. So to wrap up RS&I, we see new diagnostics, unique truck repair information, and a growing undercar equipment offering driving positive trends, improving our position with repair shop owners and managers across the globe. Well, that's the highlight of our quarter, growth and improvement. C&I strength at SNA Europe and emerging markets and in critical industries, expanding margins. The Tools Group, growing double-digits again, robust sales and operating margin continuing to enhance our franchise network. RS&I, advancing its position, making gains in both independent shops and OEMs, growing operating margins by 120 basis points. And Financial Services, raising its contribution and helping provide strategic evidence of growth for out Tools Group and overall for the corporation. Sales increasing organically by 8.4%. Opco operating income margin of 17.7%, up 100 basis points. EPS $2.03 in the quarter, 12.8% higher than the $1.80 last year. It was another encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo who will take you through the financials in detail. Aldo? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $851.8 million in the quarter were up 8.4% organically. On a reported basis, net sales including $43.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, increased $25.3 million or 3.1% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our year-over-year Q2 sales comparisons by 570 basis points. Consolidated gross profit of $419 million increased $18.6 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 49.2% in the quarter improved 80% from 48.4% a year ago. Operating expenses of $268.2 million increased $5.9 million largely due to higher volume-related and other expenses, including higher pension expense, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 31.5% improved 20 basis points from 31.7% last year. No restructuring costs were incurred in the second quarter of 2015. In the second quarter of last year, we incurred $1.4 million of such costs. Pension expense in the quarter was approximately $2 million higher as compared to the prior year, mostly reflecting the impacts of lower discount rates as well as increased life expectancies. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $150.8 million in the quarter, including $12 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 9.2% and as a percentage of sales improved 100 basis points to 17.7%. Financial Services revenue of $58.7 million in the quarter increased 13.5% from 2014 levels, while operating earnings of $41.4 million increased 19%. The increases in both revenue and operating earnings primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $192.2 million in the quarter, including $12.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $11.2 million. And the operating margin of 21.1% improved 140 basis points from 19.7% a year ago. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 32% compared with 32.9% in the second quarter and 32.1% for the 2014 full year. Finally, net earnings of $120 million or $2.03 per diluted share increased $13.9 million or $0.23 per share representing a 12.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group on slide seven. Sales of $295.8 million in the quarter were up 11.2% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, a mid single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business, and a double-digit increases in both the segment's power tools and Asia-Pacific operations. Gross profit in the C&I Group of $112.9 million in the quarter increased $1.1 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to the benefits of higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 38.2% decreased 70 basis points largely due to a shift to lower gross margin sales, including higher sales to the military and increased sales in our Asia-Pacific operations. Operating expenses of $70.7 million in the quarter decreased $2.9 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 23.9% improved 170 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage, including benefits from the previously mentioned sales shift. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $42.2 million, including $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $4 million from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.3% improved 100 basis points. Turning now to slide eight. Second quarter sales of the Snap-on Tools Group of $398.7 million increased 11.2% organically, reflecting double-digit sales gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $176.5 million increased $15.4 million from 2014 levels and the gross margin of 44.3% in the quarter improved 70 basis point, primarily, due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $108.5 million increased $7.9 million from 2014 levels, principally due to higher volume related and other expenses, partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation. The second quarter operating expense margin was 27.2% in both years. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $68 million, including $6.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $7.5 million, and the operating margin of 17.1% improved 70 basis points. Turning to the Repairs Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on slide nine. Sales of $277.4 million in the quarter increased 3.3% organically from 2014 levels. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and low single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $129.6 million increased $2.1 million over 2014 levels, principally due to benefits of higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring cost, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 46.7% improved 90 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $61.9 million in the quarter decreased $1 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by higher volume related and other expenses. The operating expense margin of 22.3% improved 30 basis points from 2014. Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $67.7 million including $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $3.1 million from prior year levels and the operating margin of 24.4% improved 120 basis points. Now, turning to slide 10. In the second quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $41.4 million on revenue of $58.7 million compared with operating earnings of $34.8 million on revenue of $51.7 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.8% in the quarter compared with 17.5% last year; and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared with 9.5% last year. Originations of $253.4 million increased 8.9% from 2014 levels. Moving to slide 11. As of quarter end, our balance sheet includes approximately $1.47 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.27 billion from our U.S. Snap-on Credit operations. Approximately, 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $63 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $160.3 million in the quarter increased $35.9 million from comparable 2014 levels, reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by investing activities of $85.4 million included $58.1 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Second quarter capital expenditures of $27.7 million included $7.8 million to acquire a previously leased bandsaw manufacturing facility in United Kingdom. Capital expenditures in the second quarter of last year were $22.7 million. Turning to slide 13. Days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year end. Inventories increased $23.7 million from 2014 year end levels primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year end. Our quarter end cash position of $124.6 million decreased $8.3 million from 2014 year end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding, $416 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 580,000 shares for $86.9 million, dividend payments of $61.7 million, and capital expenditures of $45.8 million. These cash decreases were largely offset by $319.3 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $238.4 million of cash from operations net of $25 million of discretionary cash contributions to the company's domestic pension plans, and $36.5 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises. Our net debt to capital ratio of 25.8% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year end. In addition to our $124.6 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At quarter end, we had $35 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. Now, I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's the Snap-on results. Once again, we believe the period stands as clear testimony to the opportunities abundant along our runways for growth and for improvement. And it confirms our team's capability to keep taking full advantage despite the challenges, like unfavorable currency, turbulent economies and varying industry dynamics, we are progressing along our runways for growth. C&I organic sales rising 11.2%; OI margin 14.3%, up 100 basis points, extended to critical industries, gains in aviation and the military, building in emerging markets. The Tools Group enhancing the van channel, wielding the network more powerfully than ever. Organic sales up 11.2%; OI margins 17.1%, a 70 basis point increase. And RS&I, organic sales up 3.3%; OI margin 24.4%, an increase of 120 basis points. And the overall corporation growing organically at 8.4%, overcoming the headwind. And we demonstrated progress down our runways for improvement. The Corporate OI margin was 17.7%, up 100 basis points more than offsetting 40 basis points of unfavorable currency impact. Putting it all together with Financial Services' contributions, earnings per share reached $2.03, up 12.8% against the wind. Second quarter was encouraging and we believe it demonstrates again that Snap-on has the inherent advantages, the opportunities and the capabilities to advance, to resist the turbulence, to keep progressing, and to extend our positive trend of performance as we go forward. Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll speak a moment to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening, please know that the encouraging results of the second quarter would not have been possible without your dedication and capability, your demonstrated skill, clear commitment, and extraordinary contribution to our team; you have my congratulations and you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : And we'll take our first question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Congratulations Nick on a great quarter. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks. Thank you. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : I guess I'm struck by the slow originations growth, up 8.9%, and what looks like divergence against a double-digit growth in big ticket. And I'm mindful that credit typically exists on the sell-through. Is it possible that your franchisees are just seeing a much higher level of inventory right now and that would have explained that divergence or maybe you could help us understand that? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: There's a lot of vintage in that. Fundamentally, there is questions of timings, there is a secondary market that comes into that, there is the questions of the how much \u2013 what are those actually sold at versus what we sell, what sales price we book versus what the van driver books. The numbers are something like this, I think they're \u2013 what were they, 8.9% this quarter? David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: And originations in 11.2%. But last quarter, they were reverse, it was 14.2% versus 12.9%. And the quarter before that it was \u2013 in other words, 14.2% was the originations and 12.9% was the Tools Group, and 7.5% (36:16) was the originations in the fourth quarter and 11.8% was the Tools Group. So they don't match up perfectly. We are unconcerned \u2013 we're not concerned about anything like that. And we don't see anything like buildup of inventory in the vans at all. This is just a matter of timing and the differences I pointed out. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. And that big ticket growth, you were talking about the double-digit growth. Is there any way you can help us understand the difference between price mix growth versus volume growth? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: You mean \u2013 well, I think \u2013 look, the big ticket items are \u2013 you mean, in terms of big ticket growth itself or the effect on Tools? David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. No, the big ticket growth. I'm just trying to understand how much of that was from \u2013 I'm presuming you're talking about revenue growth and I'm just wondering how much of that... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. No, if you're talking about revenue growth. Generally, big ticket prices are \u2013 when we're talking about \u2013 when I talk about big ticket growth, I'm talking about what the big ticket items were a year ago, and they've grown actually at double-digits, a little faster than the Tools Group. And, in fact, that's, I would say, apples-to-apples in terms of pricing. So it's pretty much volume growth in that situation. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Volume growth. Okay. And then last question, just \u2013 there's been a lot of talk about competition within the diagnostic space and there's been a lot of evolution lately in terms of how people are going to market the value prop and how it's packaged. Are you feeling the increased presence of competitive product in the market? That might explain the lower organic growth rates in RS&I or how should we think about that? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't think so. I mean, first of all, it's one quarter; that's one thing. And that can be moved up and down. But the diagnostics and information business \u2013 the sale of diagnostics and our information products into independent repair shops, which is the space we're talking about, was up fairly strongly in the quarter. I think we said high single digits. So \u2013 mid-single digits. So that was a little bit better than RS&I. And then second thing is, I would offer that \u2013 I was just on these Rock N' Roll \u2013 I was on one of these techno vans recently. And the van driver told me, he said, we're not associated \u2013 we're not worried about competition, our biggest competition is the difficulty in getting to a technician and explaining to him the product, getting him to appreciate the value of our business. He didn't cite any competitors at all. In fact, I never see \u2013 I was just with 1,200 customers over the weekend and that \u2013 10 days ago, and they were talking about this product and basically they talked about the idea that it was better than anything else we had \u2013 better than anything else we had brought out. Secondly \u2013 I mean, thirdly, I would suppose that when you \u2013 when we survey independent technicians, when we ask them what's your preferred form of diagnostic, it's still overwhelmingly Snap-on. I think the numbers, the latest numbers we have are 60 for Snap-on, 11 for number two. So you see all those. Now, if you come back to RS&I, I suppose your question was RS&I I personally think, we were encouraged by the RS&I growth because of the equipment business, which tends to get dinged because of Eastern Europe. So ironically, equipment business was \u2013 grew, I think Aldo said, low single-digits. So it's somewhat of a drag from a volume point of view, but from a margin point of view, because in my remarks, I talked about that new aligner, the V2400, hey, that's a great product and it's selling very well and it's a great margin generator for us. So what you saw from an equipment business actually was a little bit of drag on RS&I revenues, but a boost on RS&I margins, because of the aligner business, because it helps you understand RS&I a little bit more. But we don't see, actually we don't see, at least in my interactions from the market. So logically or at least in talking to market we don't see much pressure and then empirically, we don't see it in our numbers as pressure either. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Is there any way you can size for us the size of the Eastern European undercar business as a percentage? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't think I want to get into that granularity, but... David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Sure. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: ...but I can just say that that business is bigger for equipment -bigger than for equipment than anybody else, because \u2013 and it becomes a historical thing. We made better inroads in Eastern Europe and the Middle East than almost any of our other businesses. And so it has been particularly impacted by this particular downturn and in this particular set of economic dynamics. Now, we have other \u2013 we're not mourning or wringing our hands over that, but when you start slicing the corporation down into pieces, that you start to see it a little bit more like it comes out in RS&I. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Great quarter. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. This is Joe Vruwink for David. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Hi, Joe. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Hello, Joe. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Sticking with diagnostics, Nick, when you originally started throwing out a gross target for that segment and thinking it would grow kind of near to 5% rate. I believe the strategy at that time was to sell a diagnostics unit to a repair shop, and now you're talking about selling diagnostics units to each technician within that shop. And so how might that change maybe the longer-term growth profile for the business knowing the evolution of that strategy? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Well, first of all, I'm not abandoning the idea we're selling for the shops. I think we still have a lot of runway in terms of, what I would call, the downtown diagnostics, the things that will stand up and tell your fortune, the higher level ones that a shop would buy and might have one or two of them in the shop. We still have a lot of runway in that area, so \u2013 and it's a very important product line for us. And, in fact, we feel pretty positive about the possibilities and the opportunity for that opportunity, but I think what you say is very true. We now know that more and more of the repair activities in a shop are going to require diagnostics. I think I said possibly on the last call that roughly 40% of repairs require diagnostics today, and the new cars 80% of the repair. So you can see how that's going to go as new cars roll into the marketplace. And so maintenance techs as opposed to the repair techs, guys who do oil changes and battery changes, and just tune up the cars are going to have to use diagnostics to do these kinds of things to reset some of the parameters that they start with, that they change when they make these changes. And so we'll be looking to sell diagnostics, those things. That's the purpose of the ETHOS Tech. So you would expect that that would add a boost to that. But I would still say, I would still say \u2013 let's not talk of 4% to 6%, I would still say that if you look at the long-term sort of over the horizon opportunities for our businesses, I would rank C&I with the critical industries and the emerging markets as the highest growth opportunity. It's got unbounded opportunity. If you look at \u2013 I would say, this particular one sits in the middle. And then the Tools Group, we've been able to wield that model better and better reach more technicians, but at the end of the day, it is bounded. So I'd put them in those pieces. Now maybe you might (43:58) between the 4% to 6% number, but I \u2013 for our overall business, but I still see RS&I in that middle, in middle. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And I probably won't get you to update the range itself today. So I guess I can move on to my next question. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Really, what I'm saying \u2013 let me just try to clarify. When I said 4% to 6%, I meant generally we can grow at that level. If you want to look at the Tools Group, we said it'd be at the bottom. We can grow at that level, roughly double GDP, without necessarily coming up with things that would make our models more powerful. We could capture more customers, we could add more \u2013 no accelerators. Now, you see what happened in the Tools Group, we got accelerators on top of that breaking through the barriers of space and time. I was just on a techno \u2013 I just said I was on a techno van, we talked about that. We always \u2013 we always thought about that, well, it saves time. And what it does is both the Rock N' Roll cab and the techno van save time for the franchisees, because when the franchisee rides in parallel with these vans a couple times a year, it's like a training seminar. Because the guy who's running the van is an incredible salesman, and it saves our franchisee from going to a training center \u2013 seminar to learn how to sell tool storage or to learn how to sell diagnostics. And that's one of the reasons why the sales are up, we not only added to the retail space, but we also boosted the capabilities of our franchisees. That's why same-store sales have been up greater than 6% 20 of the last 21 quarters, that's the kind of effect. So I think if we keep discovering ways to do that, we'll beat that 4% to 6%. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Sure. Now, that's great color. Shifting gears a little bit, what's your experience around China before Snap-on and while at Snap-on? Is there anything going on in that region that gives you pause or areas of concern that you might be seeing just given your experience there? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Look, China is \u2013 I would see China through Tiananmen. you got to remember. So I was there when \u2013 I remember going to the hotel, The Shanghai Hilton and I stayed there three days, I never saw another guest. And three months before that, it was like going to the gold rush. So you see a lot of variations in China, I think this is quite normal. You're seeing some variation, but nothing that would affect my view of the long-term trajectory. I see opportunities for us. The repair ways will rise, we will take advantage of it. The shape of that advantage, we have to figure out going forward; that's really our situation. Of course, Asia is now \u2013 I think it's correct and popular to say that Asia is varying and it is. You see variations in India, Modi isn't catching on quite a bit. You see Indonesia coming back actually. Japan is actually getting a little better. We had a pretty good \u2013 we had a reasonable quarter in Japan. Korea came back, even though MERS has given us some problem, we had a good quarter in Korea. So you have variations, but nothing that interdicts the long-term view. And I spend six weeks a year there. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And nothing \u2013 if the long-term in China is so positive, what about more the near-term, any risks or volatility? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Well, yeah \u2013 sure, there's volatility, but we're not looking for a meltdown, that kind of thing, there's volatility. There is volatility in China of course. We have good \u2013 we have great quarters, we have medium quarters, those kinds of things. Our Asia-Pacific business, as Aldo said, they grew double-digits in a quarter. Okay? Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Very good. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Morning, Liam. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Morning. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Nick, I'm sorry, I'd like to stay on Asia-Pacific for a moment. You have had a fair amount of upfront investment there. It seems like you're getting growth. But in generally, directionally, are the margins you're getting out of the region or the direction of the trends, are they on track with expectations? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Actually, we have no worry about, I think, the margins in that regard. I mean, it's the geography, it's the P&L geography. I think, you saw in Aldo's discussion again on C&I how \u2013 I think, gross margins were down 70 basis points and we made it up on SG&A, well it was SG&A up 170 basis points. And what's \u2013 the principle component of that was the geography of certain big players, and Asia-Pacific is one of them, lower gross margin, lower SG&A, but OI margin kind of on track for what we like to do, if you adjust for that forward investment. So we feel okay about that. I think we continue to be confident in that regard. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Okay. And staying with C&I, you mentioned power tools as being a driver of growth. Typically that's \u2013 is that unique to the quarter or is there something going on in the market where you're getting a step-up in demand there? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't think it's anything in the market, I think it's \u2013 look \u2013 I think \u2013 actually, I think we hit a bonanza this quarter and you know what we did? We actually took power tools and garbed them in the 95th anniversary colors. And remember me talking about the box, how people like, signed up for this $10,000 box to put, in effect, a shrine to our corporation in the workplace. Well, if you offer it to them at a couple hundred dollars, they're even more enthusiastic. So part of what we're seeing there is this kind of push. We put the \u2013 our half inch pneumatic impact, which is a popular product, but we garbed it in the 95th anniversary or the cordless ratchet or our air hammers, things like that, or our cordless impact, and those have become popular. I don't think it's a special demand thing. I think power tools are kind of people \u2013 they wear out, people buy them periodically and it's like a new car, you show up with a new color and especially 95th anniversary colors for Snap-on is a collector item and it's a particularly compelling color. And so they like that. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Thank you, Nick. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: That's what's driving it. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator : And we'll go next to Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research. Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hi. Good morning gentlemen. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Hi, Tom. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Morning, Tom. Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey. Just wondering \u2013 staying on the C&I Group for a little bit, you called out, Nick, aviation and military doing well. I was just wondering if there's any segments that were lagging your expectations. And then just... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yeah... Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : ...maybe just kind of a follow-up is, just kind of reset where you have the larger international exposure in the C&I Group? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. We had a good quarter \u2013 this happens every quarter. We have variations because we have six or seven critical industries in that area. This quarter, we happen to have a good \u2013 we had good progress in aviation, heavy duty \u2013 the heavy duty sector was strong for us, railroads were strong, oil and gas was weak. I think \u2013 but actually, I'm not so sure, last time it was up against the wind. And I think, for us, we're just starting to penetrate these areas. So they're not so driven by the economics as they are, when you're just starting to penetrate, you can get quite a variation from quarter to quarter, that's the kind of thing we saw. We saw some flatness in things like mining, stuff like that. But, generally, that's the \u2013 military was up double-digits. We kind of expect C&I to keep \u2013 the idea of extending to critical industries to keep going, to keep moving. Now, I don't say it happens every quarter. I mean, this is a great example. I mean, I say every second quarter that we feel very good from a C&I \u2013 we feel very good right now about our Commercial & Industrial trajectory, we feel very good about our Tools trajectory, we feel very good about our software and diagnostics trajectory. But that's the trajectory \u2013 and without giving \u2013 I'm not warning anything or saying anything about \u2013 third quarter's always squirrely. I mean we have vacations in the third quarter and so on. So you can't tell what sectors will be going in and out, because we have our franchisees going on vacations sometimes usually in the third quarter, Europe is on vacation. So it's hard for me to predict it for every quarter. But I can tell you, we feel very encouraged by the trajectory. And I'm not in any way trying to say that we're going to have a tepid third quarter or anything like that. Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay, great. And then just following up on the Tools Group, certainly there's a nice step up in operating margin both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Being relatively new to the story, I was just wondering if there is anything unique in the quarter kind of one time that moved it up or does it just reflect continued strong growth in the RCI and maybe new tool roll outs? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yeah, it's all of those. Look, I think what's happened in the Tools Group is in the quarter \u2013 as you know, we focus on quarters, but the limited information \u2013 the limited indication of what's going on in the Tools Group though has been doing this for some time now. Like I said, the numbers are something like this, what, 11.2% this quarter organically, 12.9% the quarter before that, 11.8% the quarter before that, 6.2% the quarter before that, 6.6% the quarter before. So they're kind of \u2013 they've been growing at 6% plus for, as I said, 20 of the last 22 quarters in effect almost defying GDP gravity. And so they're learning, they've learned. This management team has been in a while. They're learning how to wield this capable, tremendous model even better, things like the Rock N' Roll cab, the TechKnow Express, learning what products, learning the power of garbing the power tools into the 95th anniversary, figuring out how to do that, figuring out how to do \u2013 that's the things that are occurring. And that when you marry it up with RCI, that allows you to do these things more effectively, allows you to drive profitability upwards as well as volume. One other thing is that \u2013 I think I've said this is that \u2013 one of the things that works for us, kind of a tailwind in a way is that we're a company that has complex product offerings, 65,000 SKUs and we keep turning out more, because we try to solve everybody's \u2013 we try to solve a wide array of problems well the idea of modern technology, 3D printing, finite element analysis, X-ray diffractometers that allows you to look more accurately at the metallurgy, the kinds of things we get out of \u2013 more accurately getting the information out of customer connection into the mark \u2013 into our innovation process; those kind of things accrue with amplified advantage to somebody who has a complex product line, you're seeing some of that. Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : And we'll go next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Hey, Gary. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Good morning, Gary. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Good morning. A couple of quick questions. Your emerging markets business, Nick, I don't think I either quoted or you said it, but what was the growth there? And what's the percentage of sales now out of emerging markets? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: It's 10%. And the growth was \u2013 well, it depends if you talk about Eastern Europe as emerging markets, right. Eastern Europe. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Right. Okay, so I mean. Yeah, okay, if you want to roll that in, it ain't so good but the thing is Asia-Pacific grew double-digits. So you can look at it that way. I think \u2013 we actually have some businesses that weren't so bad in Eastern Europe, but, generally, it was an element of pain this period. And I \u2013 so I think you could call that an offset. Asia, okay. Asia, okay. Middle East, if you want to call that emerging market, that was kind of weak. South America was okay, Chile was up, Argentina was up. So you kind of got a balance there, a cocktail of things. So let me just summarize. Asia-Pacific double-digits. I think South America, the South \u2013 the Latin American countries, the bigger ones for us were up more \u2013 kind of double-digity type stuff. Eastern Europe tough, down. And Middle East, down. So that's where we are. And you roll it all up, when you classify something reasonably, a rational man would classify as emerging markets 10% of our business. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. And then, you \u2013 at times in the past you've talked that you try and do 40 plus products, new product introductions that generate over $1 million of sales. It just appears to be, from the last couple of calls that that number has increased. And could you comment on that? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Actually \u2013 go ahead, sorry. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: No, I was just going to add. I would assume that as newer cars proliferate, that is going to dictate to you \u2013 your company as to what new products you're going to come out with as the car part (57:39)? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I agree. You're right. Actually, I agree. I think we have great opportunities. And the thing I've said is, the way we measure the effectiveness of our innovation process, one of the measures is the number of hit products, $1 million sellers in the first year of after first year of being on the market. And I think you and I have been in this conservation that we were four, five \u2013 in the last couple of years, we were four times, five times what we were just in 2006 and we keep pushing that envelop. It's not so much \u2013 I think we're getting better at doing that. It's not so much a number counting game it's getting better and they're having more impact and they're driving more sales and they're doing better things. Like \u2013 just like, I'll tell you what, it sounds like not so important. But the idea of the combo ratcheting wrench that will have a low profile, 25% more \u2013 25% more strength, 95% more life, will get in smaller spaces, that one is going to be a great product for us, and people are so excited about it. People are saying that's the kind of thing we're \u2013 so I think we're not only bringing out a lot of them, bringing out better ones, because the whole product development process, we're more effective at it. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Thank you, Nick. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Okay, Gary. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research : Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Congrats on the quarter. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thank you. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Good morning, Richard. Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research : Just curious about \u2013 on the new product development side, we're seeing more and more penetration of things that are related to active safety and autonomous driving or assisted-driving automated systems, these kinds of things. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: We love it. Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research : Yeah. I was just going to ask, are you already preparing for these kinds of things... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yeah, we love that. Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research : ...like what you're hearing from customers? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Because we love this thing. I mean, if you think about it, okay, autonomous driving. The thing is that \u2013 if they go to autonomous driving, there used to be an incredibly \u2013 before autonomous driving, there would be an incredibly complex computer system for any imprecisions on the car, that was called the human brain. Think about alignment for example, if the car was a little bit out of alignment, you could adjust the wheel a little bit. Now, if you have autonomous driving, let's say automatic parking, you better not be out of alignment, you're going to hit the parking meter. And so that's going to require many more procedures and more precise procedures and we're the company to give it to you. So we love those kinds of actions. And so we're thinking about it, particularly around anything around calibration very much helps you. And that's sort of the equipment business \u2013 that's why we're so excited about the new V2400 aligner, because it's kind of a downtown aligner which creates more accuracy and therefore fits right into this. Richard John Hilgert - Morningstar Research : Okay. Very good. Thank you. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-on, Inc.: Operator? Operator : And with no questions in the queue, I'll turn it back over to our speakers for any comments or closing remarks. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-on, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Aaron, and thanks everyone for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on our website. And as always, we thank you for your interest in Snap-on. Have a good day. Bye. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference. Everyone, we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks, Leslie. Morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the third quarter highlights, provide an update on the environment and speak a bit about our trends. Aldo will then provide a detailed review of the financials. In the third quarter, we again showed progress along our runways for growth and for improvement, and we saw those gains across our operating segments. Organic sales were up 7.3% from last year. Opco operating margin, it reached 17.5%, up 130 basis points. When you add the $43.5 million in operating earnings from Financial Services, up from $37.7 million in 2014, the consolidated operating margin was 21.2%, an increase of 160 basis points. And EPS, EPS was $1.98, up $0.22 or 12.5% from the $1.76 of last year. Our reported sales increase was 1.9% including the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. And in this quarter, that total was $42.6 million, about the same as the second quarter. Adding the incremental $2.1 million sales from our third quarter acquisition of Ecotechnics, the total reported sales for the period were $821.5 million. For automotive repair businesses, the environment continues to be favorable. Actually, it's been that way for a while. And our Tools Group and Repair Systems & Information, our RS&I Group, are both well positioned to take full advantage. You can see it in the performance, another quarter of solid gains for both groups, advancing along our runways for growth. Clearly, the Tools Group demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network, gains in all its markets, continuing to take advantage of the opportunities that are so abundant in a changing vehicle fleet, not only in the United States, but in places like the UK and Australia. And RS&I, with strong sales across North America and parts of Europe, double-digit growth in the U.S. and modest gains in Western Europe, offsetting the continuing softness in Eastern Europe and particularly in Russia. RS&I progress achieved with independent repair shop owners and managers, and with OEM dealerships, advanced by our latest diagnostics and undercar product offerings. For the Commercial & Industrial, our C&I Group, we overcame some increased headwinds with the overall organic sales rise offsetting mixed environments across industries and across geographies. That said, in the third quarter, our European based hand tool businesses and our Asia Pacific operations recorded high-single-digit gains overcoming the turbulence within their particular markets. Now our Industrial division did have some headwinds in the period, impacted by weak U.S. military volume and slowdowns in our oil and gas activity. We've consistently mentioned the uncertainty associated with the military. In the third quarter, that caution materialized and our results included a double-digit decrease. Measured spending and budget constraints making the present tight and the future even more difficult to predict. Within our Natural Resources segment, volume in oil and gas was down substantially. You see it in oil prices, and you read about it in the newspapers. And despite our small share and opportunities for penetration, we were impacted. But that said, saying that, there will always be headwinds. They've been a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter and we overcame, because we're well positioned to confront the challenges and proceed down all our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding the repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets. These do represent the avenues for advancement and there has been consistent progress along each of those paths. At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-On value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, these are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvements, but this quarter we especially benefited from customer connection and innovation. Customer connection : Snap-on's continuing pursuit of understanding of work derived from the hours and the days we spend with professionals. Innovation: taking that practical insight and matching it with the possibilities of modern technologies. And in the quarter, those processes resulted in more prestigious product awards for the corporation. We were again honored with two MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Awards. The winners this time are 3/8-inch Drive Steering Rack Sockets and our SOLUS Edge diagnostic handheld. Let's talk about the steering rack socket. The S6229 was developed from a customer connection derived from direct observation of work and from conversations with multiple technicians. This innovative tool allows the tech to replace power steering O-rings without removing the whole steering assembly, saving up to an hour of labor, clearly making work easier and professional repair more productive. In addition, also created out of deep insight in the repair process, the innovative SOLUS Edge coverage for hundreds of vehicle systems, including hybrid, TPMS, steering and clean diesel, and it all comes loaded with our Fast-Track Troubleshooter database with its vehicle specific tips, tests and time savers. The SOLUS Edge is enhanced coverage for over 40 car makes without the cost or complexity of factory scan tools. And for all its power, for all its strength, it's easy to use. The large 8-inch touch-screen display is an aid to visibility and the software provides accurate results in as little as 30 seconds, quick. I mention these awards because they're just the most recent recognitions of a growing list of very popular products that provide unique advantages, created by the observations of our franchisees and direct salespeople who are committed to translating that insight into productivity innovations, and that broad value creation is reflected in the positive results registered across all our operating groups again this quarter. Now let's focus on those individual groups. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, organic sales were up 3.4%, operating margins reached 14.3%, up 60 basis points from last year's 13.7%, growth along with the benefits of Snap-on value creation. Now I said, as we said, there are headwinds, but our Industrial direct salesmen have been expanding their reach nevertheless into sectors like railroads, up double-digits, growing our presence, offering a wider variety of tools and tool control solutions. We've spoken in the past about building our understanding of work in critical industries, expanding our customer connections. Well, one way that's happening is by using our experience in RCI, participating in customer Lean events, participating in the customer sponsored Lean events, our team was able to assist in improving railroad operations, while at the same time gaining a better understanding of their work processes, their product requirements, their business needs and their overall industry direction, all key customer connections gained through Lean event participation. One of the tools conceived from those insights was our special extendable line of tube wrenches, great for heavy-duty work on railroad cars and tracks. Made in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant, these tube wrenches replace the traditional slugging wrenches in railroad applications, allowing the operator better access, eliminating the need for costly two-person slugging procedures and making work easier, safer and more productive. Let's speak about SNA Europe. Now, eight quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, navigating through some of the most difficult geographies and tepid economies. SNA Europe activities continues to be encouraged \u2013 activity continues to be encouraging, but its profits are even more positive, now up significantly for 10 straight quarters. And we believe there's much more room for further gains. And related to our Asia Pacific operations, the environments are mixed, but we had overall gains with upward movement in places like Thailand and Indonesia and Vietnam. Actually it's nice to see progress in Vietnam, that emerging Southeast Asia nation. So that provides a bit of color on C&I. Now, on to the Tools Group. Organic sales up 11%, 11%, significant growth in the U.S. and internationally. Operating income $56.3 million compared to $49.5 million in 2014. Operating income margins of 14.8% rose 90 basis points from last year's 13.9%. The additional volume as well as operating improvements from RCI translated into significant margin improvement, and that 90 basis point gain overcame 120 basis points of negative currency. When you consider the Tools Group's success, you see the power of Snap-on value creation, and the benefits of our award-winning innovative new products. Besides the MOTOR Top 20 award, the Tools Group also received recognition from the readers of Professional Tool & Equipment News, gaining five People's Choice selections for new tool innovation products, once again born at the intersection between customer connection insight and advanced technology wielded by our innovation teams, products like the KRL, 72-inch Roll Cab with its Power Tool Organizer System, the powerful and light CT8850, 18-volt cordless impact wrench, our new brake caliper press, our new advanced battery system tester with its print capability, and our new EET2 full view welding helmet, all selected by the readers of PTEN Magazine and by our technician customers as great new products, products that make work easier and products that provide further evidence of Snap-on innovation. You might remember that the third quarter is also when we hold the annual Snap-on Franchisees Conference, our SFC. This year it was in Washington, D.C., with more than 8,000 attendees, franchise and family members from over 3,000 routes, three days of showcasing the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel, to amplify the power of our van space and of our franchisees' time. And based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees, it was a strong success. And by the way, orders were up once again, beating the record level achieved in 2014. When we speak of the van channel, we also have to consider the very strategic contributions of Snap-on Credit. Our Financial Services arm helps create opportunities across our organization, but especially within the Tools Group and Credit had a strong presence at the SFC. Supporting franchisees with unique programs, enabling sales of those big ticket items, which are so essential to franchisee success. And in the third quarter, Financial Services OI was up $5.8 million or 15.4%, another period of powerful contribution to the organization. Let's move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 8.2%. The operating margin of 24.6%, it increased 130 basis points from 23.3% just last year. RS&I was charged with expanding our presence to repair shop owners and managers and in the quarter, it did just that. We once again had growth in our businesses providing repair, information and diagnostics to independents. In fact, we appear to be gaining traction across many dimensions in automotive, in medium and in heavy duty garages, serving both OEM dealerships as well as those independent shops, all fueled by our expanding product offering. And one of those great RS&I product came from our diagnostics division, demonstrating its continuing innovation. Our diagnostics team launched its new VERUS Edge handheld, an enhanced top-of-the-line offering. Thinner, lighter, including important features like five-second ready-to-use capability, five-hour battery life, a solid state hard drive for increased durability and, of course, access to our unique integrated SureTrack real-world fixes based on masses of actual repair data, all features guided by effective customer connection input. In the VERUS Edge, we believe we have in it a winner, advancing the state-of-the-art and addressing the most serious of repair challenges, and initial sales of breaking the records and exceeding our expectations. Also in the third quarter and with the focus on heavy duty shops, RS&I introduced the latest generation of its proprietary vehicle interface, the Nexiq USB-Link 2, now with Wi-Fi connectivity. It extends our leading position by adding wireless capabilities to the already successful family of Nexiq heavy duty diagnostics product. The USB-Link 2 is compatible with heavy duty diagnostic applications for engines, transmission, ABS and instrument clusters and much more. It supports virtually every standardized vehicle network protocol and nearly every software application in vehicle sectors like construction, agriculture, and of course heavy duty truck. Five times the speed of its predecessors with 16 times the memory, the USB-Link 2 is perfect for dealership, fleets, and truck shops. It speeds the repair times of these particularly mission critical vehicles and it improves technician productivity. It's a great upgrade to an already successful product of our RS&I group. Also in the third quarter, our equipment division registered high single-digit growth with strong volume in North America, helping to offset the Russian market, which is our primary headwind in Eastern Europe. Overall, undercar gains in the U.S. were quite solid with especially impressive increase \u2013 sales increases at our Challenger Lifts division. Challenger has been a great addition to our Snap-on team and it improved again this quarter and we believe there is much more to come, helping RS&I to expand with repair shop owners and managers. RS&I, great new product, with demonstrated growth in diagnostics, heavy duty and undercar equipment, and all of that played out in the third quarter results. Well, that's the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales up 7.3%, gains across all groups, clear progress along our runways for growth. Snap-on Value Creation at the forefront of our activities, customer connection leading to innovation, creating powerful new products, RCI driving improvement and it all shows in the results, OI margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Thanks, Nick. Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $821.5 million in the quarter were up 7.3% organically. On a reported basis, net sales including $42.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency, increased to 1.9%. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 570 basis points. Net sales in the third quarter also included $2.1 million of sales from our July 2015 acquisition of Ecotechnics, a designer and manufacturer of automatic vehicle air conditioning maintenance equipment for OEM dealerships and independent repair shops. Consolidated gross profit of $406.9 million increased $13 million from 2014 levels, primarily due to the higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The gross margin of 49.5% in the quarter improved 60 basis points from 48.9% a year ago. Operating expenses were $263.3 million in both the third quarters of 2015 and 2014. The operating expense margin of 32% improved 70 basis points from 2014 levels, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, partially offset by higher pension expense. No restructuring costs were included in operating earnings in the third quarter of 2015. Last year, we incurred $2 million of such costs. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before Financial Services of $143.6 million in the quarter, including $11.9 million or 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10% and, as a percentage of sales, improved 130 basis points to 17.5%. Financial Services revenue of $61.1 million in the quarter increased 14% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $43.5 million increased 15.4%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $187.1 million in the quarter, including $12.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 11.2%, and the operating margin of 21.2% improved 160 basis points from 19.6% a year ago. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.6% compared with 31.8% last year. Finally, net earnings of $116.8 million or $1.98 per diluted share, increased to $13.1 million or $0.22 per share, representing a 12.5% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group on slide 7, sales of $288.5 million in the quarter were up 3.4% organically, driven primarily by high single-digit gains in both the segment's European-based hand tools business, and Asia-Pacific operations, and a double-digit increase in the segment's power tools operations. These sales increases were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, primarily reflecting lower sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector. Gross profit in the C&I Group of $109.5 million in the quarter decreased $2.3 million from 2014 levels, while the gross margin of 37.9% improved 50 basis points, principally due to savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs. Operating expenses of $68.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels, and the operating expense margin of 23.6% improved 10 basis points from 23.7% last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.3 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $0.5 million from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.3% improved 60 basis points. Turning now to slide 8. Third quarter sales on the Snap-on Tools Group of $380.6 million increased 11% organically, reflecting continued double-digit gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $166.5 million in the quarter increased $11.7 million from 2014 levels and the gross margin of 43.8% improved 20 basis points. Benefits from the higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were largely offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $110.2 million in the quarter increased $4.9 million from 2014 levels, and the operating expense margin of 29% improved 70 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $56.3 million increased $6.8 million, and the operating margin of 14.8% improved 90 basis points including $6.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $282.9 million in the quarter increased 8.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships, a high single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment, and a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products through independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross profit of $130.9 million increased $3.6 million over 2014 levels. Gross margin of 46.3% in the quarter decreased 60 basis points from 46.9% last year, primarily due to a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin products, including increased essential tool and micellization sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by lower restructuring cost. Operating expenses of $61.2 million in the quarter decreased $2.8 million from 2014 levels. The operating expense margin of 21.7% improved 190 basis points, mostly due to sales volume leverage including benefits from the sales shift noted above. Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $69.7 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.4 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 24.6% improved 130 basis points. Now turning to slide 10. In the third quarter, operating earnings from Financial Services of $43.5 million on revenue of $61.1 million compared with operating earnings of $37.7 million on revenue of $53.6 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.6% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both years. Originations of $257.6 million increased 16.2% from 2014 levels. Moving to slide 11, as of quarter end, our balance sheet includes $1.53 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.33 billion from our U.S. Snap-on credit operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. During the quarter, our worldwide finance portfolio grew approximately $62 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. Now, turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $113.7 million in the quarter increased $25.7 million from comparable 2014 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings in 2015 and net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by investing activities of $86.9 million included $55.9 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Third quarter capital expenditures of $18.5 million in 2015 compared to $22.3 million last year. Cash used in investing activities in the quarter also included $13.1 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics. Turning to slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables was 61 days at both quarter end and 2014 year end. Inventories increased $52.2 million from 2014 year end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions as well as inventories related to the Ecotechnics acquisition. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns of $3.4 million compared with 3.6 turns a year ago. Our quarter end cash position of $119.2 million decreased $13.7 million from 2014 year end levels. The net decrease includes the impact of funding, $629.2 million of new finance receivables, the repurchase of 670,000 shares for $101.6 million, dividend payments of $92.5 million, and capital expenditures of $64.3 million. These cash decreases were largely offset by $476.6 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, $352.1 million of cash from operations, net of $30 million of discretionary cash contribution to the company's domestic pension plans, and $39.7 million of cash proceeds from stock purchase and option plan exercises. Our net debt to capital ratio of 25.7% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year end. In addition to our $119.2 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us access to the commercial paper markets. At quarter end, we had $45.2 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. This concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for the balance of 2015. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2015 will be in the range of $80 million to $85 million, of which $64.3 million was incurred through the end of the third quarter. We continue to expect our 2015 full year effective income tax rate will be at or below our 2014 full year rate of 32.1%. Now, I'll turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on third quarter, sales up organically 7.3% against some significant headwinds. Of course as we say often, there will always be headwinds, always be challenges. But in the midst of that, we believe our runways for growth are wide with abundant opportunities and you can see it in the operating groups. C&I in the center of the turbulence, sales up 3.4%, profits up 60 basis points. RS&I, wielding software and hardware with repair shop owner and managers activity rising 8.2% and OI margin of 24.6%, up 130 basis points. Tools, an established and storied business, reaching higher, capturing more customers. Sales up 11% and a greater than 6% increase in 21 of the last 22 quarters. OI margin up 90 basis points despite 120 basis points of unfavorable currency. And beside that growth, we see the effects of Snap-on value creation paving our runways for improving, helping to drive our opco margin to 17.5%, up 130 basis points including 50 basis points of currency headwinds. And rolling all together with financial services, our EPS was $1.98, up 12.5%. We believe that the third quarter results extending our positive trends continuing confirmation of the Snap-on possibilities for both growth and for improvement. And we believe as demonstrated this past quarter, we can continue on those positive runways as we proceed forward. Now before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I think it's appropriate to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening in again. The encouraging results of the third quarter and our positive trends are a direct reflection of your capability and your effort. For the gains you've achieved, you have my congratulations. And for your commitment and your extraordinary contribution to our team, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll take our first question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Good morning. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Good morning. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : A question on RS&I, you mentioned specific strength in undercar and service chain reported this morning, it had an 11% comp in alignment. Is there something structurally going on in that space driving growth or is yours tied to new product introduction? This row (00:32:51) deterioration is a secular shift or...? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I think structurally \u2013 not something happened and I don't think this particular quarter. But I think structurally the whole automotive repair business is \u2013 got a nice tailwind in terms of changes in vehicles. And in fact as you have more vehicles that want to do more things automatically, self-driving and so on. The precision of calibration becomes more and more important and therefore the more accuracy and speed \u2013 more accuracy \u2013 things like alignment become more important and therefore the speed of that alignment becomes important, therefore the need for new products. And so, I think it's nice times for automotive repair in general and in particular for undercar equipment. And I think... Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : And I guess... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: ...ours being pushed by both at tailwind and some nice new product, that's in place as well. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And I guess, on that speed of change in technology \u2013 is sort of the next question, the software upgrade cycle as you were looking in the handheld units and replacing software, is that accelerating at all, or is the new code basically at the same cadence? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I think it's expanding. I think we're finding \u2013 I don't know, if we're introducing any faster necessarily upgrades, but I think the upgrades are more attractive. You hear me talk about SureTrack and if I had a little more time to talk about VERUS Edge, I would talk about the fact that it has technical service bulletins involved. And so, those products are more attractive and they're more liberating and they're more productivity advancing to customers and so that's driving part of that. You can see it. You can see \u2013 and I'm sure, you've looked at the trends, and you can see that, I think the numbers are something like somewhere under 50% of cars \u2013 we today require in all garages require diagnostics repairs and all garages require diagnostics units, but something like 7 of 10 repairs in new cars require diagnostics units. So you see a demand for that. And our software is the best available. One of the things you see in our \u2013 one of the things we're really excited about in our business when we did independent surveys of technician preferences, 63% said they preferred Snap-on diagnostics. Number two was 7%. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Does it help? Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Thanks. And one question I guess specifically to C&I on the U.S. military, you talked about it being particularly weak. When they are weak, are they buying less premium product or not buying at all? I mean, are they going to Harbor Freight for what they would have purchased for you or did they just step out? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: No. No. I don't think they are buying that stuff. I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure that they are not buying the stuff, because you know when the .50 caliber bullets are flying over head I think this is the ultimate critical application and I don't think anybody wants anybody being disadvantaged under those circumstances. So what really has happened by and large is the fact that there's uncertainty in where to deploy budget around. We've seen it before. Actually C&I, if you go back and look at the late \u2013 in late 2013, the critical industries, the critical industries again was bedeviled by a reduction associated with the military and that was directly associated with the word as sequestration. And so, you're starting to see those kinds of things now. In Washington people are talking about government shutdowns and so on and it's making the military nervous and they are spending less. We feel we're pretty well positioned though to take full advantage when they are ready to spend. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. So it's not trading down. It's just not spending. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: No. No. Not any significant way. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is now open. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Good morning, Liam. How are you? Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Good. Thank you. Nick, you talked about railroad as being an interesting growth segment in C&I. Are there any other areas that saw particular strength during the quarter in the C&I? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yeah. Look, we were \u2013 amazingly, we're up pretty well in mining. Like I said, we're still starting to penetrate these things. So you can't \u2013 we're finding that we're effective sometimes by \u2013 somewhat by the environment, but not \u2013 we can overcome it at times and mining was one of those. Heavy truck was up fairly well in the quarter. So that was a good entry. General, if you just look at general production, the kinds of stuff, the things that are associated with grinders and so on, we had that kind of thing. So I mean we had some fairly reasonable positive points, the U.S. aviation, the aviation in U.S. was okay, that kind of thing. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: So we had some positives. And we had oil and gas, international aviation and the military which were negative. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Okay. And with your van channel being supported now with Rock N' Roll vans, are you seeing any step up in average ticket item per franchisee during the quarter? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: No. Big ticket was still reasonably strong, but I think we're not seeing any particular, if the question is associated with the rise in the size of the \u2013 let's say the purchases, the size of the purchases, I would say no in the quarter necessarily, not anything particularly big in the quarter. Nothing that would change the trend. We're still seeing a robust demand though for things like tool storage and of course our diagnostic units and other things that we would roll into big ticket. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Nick. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington. Your line is now open. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Good morning, Gary. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Couple of the questions have been answered, particularly on industrial. But let me just ask in terms of seeing pretty good growth year-over-year in the credit portfolio, is that still indicative of that there is a healthy appetite for the tool boxes, bigger ticket items? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yeah, there's a healthy \u2013 I think there's a healthy attitude, generally it directly reflects the motion of the Tools Group. In general, if you look back at originations and look at Tools Group growth over the last three quarters, they're sort of the same, so that's pretty much what's driving it. I think it's not just tool boxes though, you get \u2013 you will get things like \u2013 you get things like big diagnostics like the VERUS Edge. I mean, the new VERUS Edge is a product that will run in several thousands of dollars and that can be financed on that kind of things. So, you will see a number of things like that. So, it's not just tool boxes, but it is \u2013 the big ticket items were, I think this quarter just slightly below, somewhat below the Tools Group in general, but over three quarters, four quarters has been better than the Tools Group. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then in terms of the Rock N' Roll vans and the techno vans, are you at capacity where you want to be right now in the U.S.? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't know. I think Rock N' Roll cab, I think we added like maybe like five in the last quarter in the techno vans and we didn't add any Rock N' Roll cabs. Rock N' Roll cabs have been solid for some time. Having said \u2013 been the same number for some time, but, you know, I wouldn't necessarily sign up to the idea that I wouldn't add more going forward. Rock N' Roll cabs were introduced somewhere in 2011. And I have to tell you, Gary, we've been learning about how to use them better and how effective they are and where they're most effective and how to do that each quarter. But for now, they're pretty much where they're going to be. The techno is something else. So we've added quite a few. I think actually year-over-year for techno, we've added 21 techno vans, and I think we'll be probably trying to see how that 21 plays out for a little while, and then we'll make a decision whether we need more or not going forward. But it's a mistake to think that tool storage sales is directly proportional to the number of Rock N' Roll cabs, that's not true. What we found is they've gotten more and more and more productive, more and more liberating every time, every quarter, and same thing for techno vans. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: All right. Well, it basically expands your store for selling space, right? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Correct, it does. But then we find out how to \u2013 then actually what we find out is how to amplify the Rock N' Roll space. I mean, it's kind of a multilayered thing. It does help that though. I mean in one sense it expands on a time-sharing basis the space, but the effect of that space, I would say over the four years we've had it, the ones that we installed first are helping a lot more than they did when they first occurred. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: And last question. Is this just the U.S. phenomenon or is this in other countries where mechanics own the tools that you have these kind of vans? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: It's in other countries. I mean I think, I guess we have seven international Rock N' Roll cabs, and so we've used them in different places, things like the UK, in Canada, and some in Australia. And we've just started to do that for the techno vans. So it's a phenomenon that can work in other places. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Thank you very much. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning, everyone. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Good morning, David. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Good morning. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So a couple of things, back on C&I. That's a business; you've got three or four different buckets of businesses within there. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: We do. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Tends to be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. It's kind of a strange question, but is there any way or anything that we from the outside should look at to try and get a better handle on what the quarter-to-quarter trends are going to be there? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't really have \u2013 the thing is that \u2013 the truth is, sure. What we know is the industry problems, the economic environments create an overhang. And then in places like, for us and you see it in oil and gas this time, you can see it in mining, although mining was a contributory for us. So it's very difficult to look at any macro and say it's going to affect us. All you can say is look, the general macro is going to create an overhang. How well we do in offsetting it is another question, but we do have the ability to offset it from time to time. Like in this quarter, we felt, we feel when we look at Industrial, when we look at critical industries, we feel we can see the trajectory of upward trends even though it was a tepid quarter, it was a drag on us this time, because we can see the gains in railroad, in places like mining and heavy duty. So we can see the proof-of-concept working through. It's hard for us to give you any guidance on that. In Asia Pacific, for example, the turbulence around Asia Pacific did really create an overhang for us, but we succeeded in some markets and had some difficulty in others. Our operations and our sales in both those markets ended up being a growth situation. In Europe, it seems like, and I think what's worked for us in Europe is we came from such a low position. We kept investing. We create new product that we're growing even as the market is tepid. So it's kind of a cocktail of things that I can't quite give you any particular macro on which to trend. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, I figured that... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: All I can tell you is I think we feel progress in each of those places. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah, I just figured that was the answer. On Asia Pacific... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yeah, yeah. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): ...that business over the years, you've continued to see strong growth on the automotive equipment side of that business. What's the makeup of that revenue today between equipment versus the critical industries versus other pieces? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't really have the percentages for you. I will say that you're right in saying that equipment is probably the biggest piece of that, and then you've got cutting tools, which are another piece of it, which are primarily Industrial based. Industrial based tools are another piece, and then what's after that, it would be, I'd say, the critical \u2013 we call them \u2013 in that world (00:46:10) we call them premium tools, like the Snap-on tools sold into the super-premium applications like Thai Airways and things like that. We actually had a pretty good quarter with those in places like Singapore and Hong Kong. And the equipment actually was one of the things that drove us into Vietnam. We're actually pretty pleased about Vietnam. I've been waiting for Vietnam to give us some daylight for some time, and this is the quarter which it kind of worked. So it was an encouraging event. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. And then one last item here on margins. You guys did a great job of continuing to drive value and drive margins with the RCI activity and the focus on execution. Are you doing anything beyond what you normally do, cost cutting or pulling back on discretionary spending or anything along those lines, belt tightening with some of the uncertainties going on around the world? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: No. We're not doing anything like that. I mean I suppose it's kind of dumb thing for a guy like me to say that, but the fact our \u2013 we \u2013 okay, people here are shaking their heads, yes, that is dumb. But, okay. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): So am I. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: It's true, we believe in our runways for growth, and we continue to invest in them. The profit improvements you are seeing, the 130 basis points, have nothing to do with restriction, nothing. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Because we don't see it that way. Of course, there are headwinds and they might impact us, and I never said we would keep going, marching upward every quarter. It's almost impossible for anybody to do that, although we have. And so we just believe in the future of extending the critical industries, enhancing the van channel, expanding with repair shop owners, and in emerging markets, so we keep investing in it. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Perfect, great. Thank you very much. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. Good morning, everyone. And Nick, congratulations on a great quarter. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Let me start off with just continuing on the point we were just discussing, and you talked about the fact that there wasn't a lot of belt tightening in this, but then you cite RCI progress in each of the individual segments. So let me reconcile this. It seems as though there has been some cost cutting. I'm looking specifically at the C&I segment, where you had a negative 5% incremental margin. In other words, revenues were down, but EBIT was up. And I know you've said repeatedly in the past that your RCI would allow you to grow margins in a flat revenue environment. Help me understand the answer you just gave to the last question versus these points. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. First of all, first of all, we view -- you may not like this either -- but we view as-reported sales as arithmetic. Organic sales are up for us, so the bits and the bytes and the metal and the mechanisms, we sell more of that we're happy. We're encouraged by that. So even in C&I, which was down, that 3.4% organic is what we follow because that looks to us to be customer gain. That's one. Two is, is that what you see in this situation is when I'm talking about RCI, I'm talking about things like being able to make the product less expensively. We reduce the set-up times in the factory, which is a big deal for us. We find ways through customer connection and our innovation process to wield new technologies that allow us to develop new product cheaper. Remember, in C&I, for example, last year in aviation, we brought \u2013 last year, in oil and gas, I think we \u2013 for heavy truck, let's say, we brought out 859 new products, and aviation was 996. And one of the things that allows us to make to do that better is new technology like 3D printing and finite element analysis and so on. And that cuts cost in the design cycle and allows us to bring out those new products with lower cost than before. Those are the kinds of things we do. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: And even if we have \u2013 so, even if we have lower as reported revenues, our cost gets driven down because of some of that. And it doesn't happen every quarter, if it happens \u2013 if I reduce the cost of one particular product, well, maybe that product sells well this quarter and I get some good benefit out of it. That may not sell so well next quarter and I don't quite get the quote at the same benefit. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. I appreciate that clarification. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Okay. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah, I appreciate the clarification. Thanks. On the originations, it's up 16%. Once again it's kind of an up 9% number last quarter. Is that really just timing? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yeah, it's pretty much. Yeah, there's a lot of timing flowing through. Remember that originations have to do with the franchisees selling the products. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Right. And you also got an SFC that flows through this. So, in originations are things like loans that go through for the franchisees themselves, like van loans and things like that that occur. And so there's that noise in van originations in the month. So when we have a particularly great SFC, that can distort that as well. But when you step back and you look at the trend of everything, it really is \u2013 there is a lot of noise from quarter-to-quarter. You've kind of got to look back. And if you look at three quarters, you'll see it's pretty close to the same, between Tools Group growth and originations, pretty close to the same and if you say that Tools Group will pick a group faster, it makes sense. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Military and oil and gas, is there any way you can size that up for us as a percentage of critical industries... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Okay. (00:51:55). I'll try this \u2013 how about this one. We mentioned like five segments, six segments in critical industries, and the military is a big one, it's the biggest because we entered there first, because it made sense. Just as I said before, when the bullets are flying overhead -- I can assure you this from personal experience, when the bullets are flying overhead, people kind of want to make sure things work. And so we figured it was the most critical of industries. We invested in it and it (00:52:16) warrants bigger. So if you take our revenues which is somewhere north of $450 million or something like that let's say, and you divide them by six and you take one of the bigger ones, that would be the military. And oil and gas would be more in the middle some place. So that helps. I think that should give you some ballpark view of this. You got one big guy who is down strong double digits, can put a little over hang on you. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Let me just ask one last question, just relating to the call here and just kind of a big picture high level question, but if you could just walk us through with some quick comments on each of the four segments. You just discussed recessionary environment, how much downside would you expect in revenues? And also, I guess, with all the progress in RCI initiatives and the new product introductions in the much richer portfolio, how much better, if at all, would margins be in the trough than what we saw last time around? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Last time around we started at 12% and went to 10%. The 12.3%, if I remember 2008, the OI percentage was like 12.3% and it went to 9.9%. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: And that was \u2013 the 9.9% was, I would say, artificially depressed by the fact that we had the credit company in transition, somewhat, not huge, but that's a factor there a little bit. And so, you can say, all right, it impacted some, but maybe not much, but okay, we had that transition going on in Tools Group and so on, maybe arithmetically it didn't affect. But down there, we had some turbulence. And so then the big difference there now is we're starting at 17.5%, all right. So I mean, I wouldn't expect it to be worse than that duration. The other factor I'd offer is this, is I believe \u2013 two factors. One is, I believe we are stronger in our market positions, therefore even more resistant, number one. Number two \u2013 number three, and this is harder to predict. Last time, our customer base, which was principally the \u2013 70% of the customer base, the automotive repair technician, I spent a lot of time talking about the fact that they were cash rich and confidence poor, they were getting up every day and reading bad news for breakfast. It was the worst recession of our lifetime. People were talking about putting dollars in mattresses. Well, I'm not sure \u2013 and so therefore they didn't buy big ticket items even though they had a lot of cash. That would happen again, but I'm not sure it'd be the same extent. I don't know. That's a judgment call of course. And one more experience at RCI than we were. And the other thing is, we're just better at RCI, and so we probably step that up. If you can't, you only have 24 hours in a day, so if you can't \u2013 if you think the prospects for growth are less, you turn more toward improvement. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : That's really helpful. Thanks a lot. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Good morning. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Good morning. Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Just as it relates to the Tools Group, certainly positive results from both the domestic and international businesses. Nick, I was wondering if you could maybe give a little additional color in regards to the contribution for the international franchise business in the Tools Group? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: The international franchise business is about, is also up double-digits. The U.S. is up strong double-digits, the U.S. is up, the international is up just about the same. I would say that in order the strength, Australia and UK were actually up more than the U.S., Canada was up somewhat less, so you put those together in a cocktail and I think it all came to about the same as the U.S. Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then I guess looking a little bit of bigger picture, I think you've kind of tested on some components so far today. Clearly an opportunity for you is to get a larger percentage of the shop related spending. Just what are your thoughts on where you are on the penetration rates when you look at complete shop spending and some of your initiatives to expand that? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Well, let's look at it this way. I think I would say that we are less than half of where we are in terms of our position with tools. And so, if you think of it that way, yes, people respect our brand, shop owners respect our brand as much as technicians. So I would view that as kind of an \u2013 view of the opportunity. We think we have runway in the tools itself for the technicians and we're well behind that in terms of shop penetration. So, I think we've got quite a bit of runway there. I would say if you want to use baseball terms, we're in the third or fourth inning. Tom L. Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to Leslie Kratcoski for any closing remarks. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. A replay and transcript of the call will be available shortly on our website. And as always, we thank you for your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : This does conclude today's teleconference. You may now disconnect. Thank you and have a great day.",

With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year. As usual, I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the environment and on our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials The Snap-on fourth quarter; organic sales up and profits well above last year. The period continued our positive trajectory of performance. Again this quarter, we had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Organic sales grew 3.1%. If we include the impact of $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, overall sales in the quarter were $851.7 million, a small decrease from last year. Our EPS was $2.22, up 12.7% from $1.97 in 2014. And that rise reflects an OpCo operating margin of 19.1%, an increase of 220 basis points. Financial service earnings of $45 million in the quarter were also up, leading to a consolidated operating margin, including both financial services and OpCo, of 22.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points. The results were encouraging. Our markets, the automotive repair-related segments, they continue to be favorable. Changing technologies and aging vehicles are requiring new tools and more repairs. Our Tools Group and our Repair Systems & Information, or the RS&I Group, took advantage of those opportunities and grew across our franchise network and with repair shop owners and managers. Now, for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or our C&I Group, markets were mixed, headwinds a bit more pronounced in the quarter, impacted by few down sectors and macro economically challenged geographies, leading to organic volume just under 2014. A couple of those difficult environments were natural resources and the U.S. military, both substantially lower in the fourth quarter. Oil and gas, a market we've identified as a long-term strategic growth opportunity for us and we continue to see it that way. But in the quarter, we experienced similar issues to those businesses with more prominent exposure in that arena and we saw a deep decline. The military sales : ongoing troop drawdown's and budget restraints led to a substantial year-over-year drop. But we continue to maintain our presence in that segment and we're poised to increase our position when the variability subsides. C&I's also the most international of businesses and was also challenged in the quarter by economic turbulence across the globe and some of the European markets and in parts of Asia Pacific. That said, C&I progressed through the quarterly headwinds, taking advantage of the opportunities in critical industries like aviation, and in national markets like Japan and Germany and Mexico, and in emerging markets like India and Indonesia. So, overall, our businesses I would characterize \u2013 overall across our businesses, I would characterize our markets as mixed. We have tailwinds in automotive repair and we have pockets of turbulence in some afflicted critical industries and in challenged geographies. Having said that, we believe that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with Snap-on's presence with repair shop owners and managers, extending into critical industries, and building in emerging markets. These are the strategic initiatives we see as decisive for our future. And we'll continue to strengthen our position along those runways as we go forward. And also, looking ahead, we also see clear runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation processes; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement or RCI, driving significant progress, and our fourth quarter and our full year results confirm those ongoing improvement possibilities. Let's speak about the full year. Snap-on's EPS in 2015 was $8.10, an increase of 13.4%. Driving those earnings was an OpCo earnings margin of 17.7%, up 140 basis points for the full year. And when we include the income from financial services of $170.2 million, which rose $21.1 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation in the year was 21.3%, up 170 basis points. That performance came on sales for the year of $3.4 billion reflecting a 7.1% organic increase, broad growth. Tools Group up 10.9%; RS&I increasing 4.9%; C&I rising 5.8%, all performances in the year reflecting significant advances down our runways for growth and for improvement. Now, let's move to the groups and their fourth quarter results. C&I: sales were down in the period 5.5% from 2014, impacted by 490 basis points of unfavorable currency. Organic sales were slightly lower than last year with varied results across the group, gains by SNA Europe, our European hand tools business and the power tools operation and decreases at the Industrial division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.9 million. That represents an operating margin of 14.9%, a rise of 130 basis points. Encouragingly, SNA Europe posted a sales increase again in the midst of significant European headwinds, continuing its progress now, nine quarters in a row of year-over-year growth, and the profits rising even higher, now up 11 straight quarters, reflecting RCI and Snap-on Value Creation, new products and new processes; positive trends in some difficult geographies. Also in C&I, our power tools division advanced in the period, bolstered by an array of new products. Innovations like our CDR8815 18V Lithium Cordless Drill launched in the quarter. It's our latest in the successful line of cordless tools; an oversized variable speed trigger, less finger stress and more accurate torque control; a heavy-duty gearbox reducing operating wobble and run-out, important for power tools. A precision single sleeve keyless chuck with carbide jaw, increasing grip and torque and enabling one-handed bit changes; a nice time saver for professionals. And all those features contained in a powerful but compact design. With the CDR8815, we believe we have a winner and the early results confirm it. Now, the Industrial division had weaker sales in the quarter, as we mentioned, and there were difficulties in military and oil and gas. That said, we've maintained our growth strategies of extending in critical industries even during this turbulence. We remain committed to ongoing advancements made possible by Snap-on Value Creation especially in customer connection and innovation, authoring new products specifically aimed at customers facing critical challenges. One of those new products, designed for the natural resource sector, is the Snap-on gas meter wrench, custom engineered for a safer and more efficient service of gas meters, rugged and lightweight with an aviation-grade aluminum body, five interchangeable heads for maximum versatility, and a 19-inch handle to more easily generate the full range of force required. Over 500,000 gas meters are replaced annually in New York City area alone and 20% to 30% of all injuries in the utility sector are attributed to the gas meter service. This innovative new Snap-on wrench was guided by customer connection, direct observation of the work and it includes an improved ergonomic design for better grip and less hand stress. And, of course, it incorporates our Snap-on Flank Drive wrenching system, eliminating slippage and requiring less force to complete the job. It's more versatile. It ends the need for a technician to carry a heavy bag of assorted pipe wrenches, and it's safer and more effective. We believe the Snap-on gas meter wrench will be a big seller; a must-have for service technicians throughout the power generation industry. It's just another example, another example of customer connection and innovation, strengthening the C&I position in critical industries. Now, on to the Tools Group; an 8.7% rise in organic sales; an encouraging increase again this quarter. The operating earnings of $71.9 million represented a margin rate of 17.5%, up 100 basis points from last year. And that gain included a 70-basis point impact from negative currency. We speak quite a bit about the runways for coherent growth. Strategic avenues of sales advancement and clearly large among those opportunities is enhancing the franchise network. The Tools Group once again demonstrated significant progress along that runway. You can see it vividly in the financial numbers for the quarter and for the full year and it's evident in the health metrics we monitor each period whether it's franchise profitability, turnover or delinquencies. The measures of franchise health are all trending upward. And that speaks to the growing strength and to the widening advantage, the widening advantage of our band network in the robust vehicle repair arena. But beyond the numbers, there's qualitative but clearly observable evidence of forward momentum. I can tell you that the franchisees at our fourth quarter National Franchise Advisory Council and more recently at the 2016 kickoff events held earlier this month demonstrated the enthusiasm and confirmed the optimism that has marked the Tools Group from route to route for some time now. And there's more evidence. We continue to be recognized as a franchise of choice. Again, this year, Snap-on ranked among the top 25 in Entrepreneurs Magazine's List of Top 500 Franchises. And the Franchise Business Review, which collects franchisee satisfaction feedback, listed Snap-on as a Top 50 Franchise in its latest ranking, marking the ninth consecutive year we received that award. It also goes without saying that the Tools Group's performance would not have been possible without the benefits of Snap-on Value Creation, particularly innovation and customer connection creating an assortment of exciting new products, born from our unique customer interactions. And for the sixth straight year, the Tools Group increased this number of hit products, million dollar sellers developed from that direct customer observation, from our onsite experience in the workplace. Let's consider our new SPBS series of striking prybars; an upgrade in performance, in durability, and most importantly, in safety. These next-generation tools include a precision ground blade with angle design for maximum lift. It also features a new grip material which performs in extremely low temperatures, in important place like Chicago today, and has greater resistance to common shop chemicals. And it features a new ergonomic handle that not only offers a more comfortable grip, but the flared design provides technician hands greatly improved protection from off-center hits. Not a small feature. It's an exceptional design made possible from customer connection, and it represents progress even in a long, established product line. Finally, I'd be missing a huge contributor to our van channel and a major strategic advantage if I didn't mention Snap-on Credit, financing the network's big ticket items. And as you would expect, the Credit operation was well represented at our kickoff meetings \u2013 at our recent kickoff meetings held in the first part of the year. And they were working to increase the power of Credit and making our finance operations an even greater strategic contributor. Snap-on is wielding its tools network more effectively every day. And the support of our Credit company is a major element in that progress. Moving to RS&I. Sales in the fourth quarter were $280.6 million with organic gains of 2.2%, reflecting a rise in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a low single digit increase to OEM dealerships, and essentially flat sales of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $72.1 million rose $6.9 million. And the OI margin, it was 25.7%, up 260 basis points from last year's 23.1% with RCI paving the way. RC&I advanced in the quarter, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, but particularly with the independents. Mitchell 1 offers independent shops leading shop management software, innovative marketing services to gain more repair customers, and the most comprehensive and capable repair information anywhere. And based on customer connection, it has thousands of customer contexts every year. Mitchell 1 keeps improving its advantage, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the ease of navigating its ProDemand system, building on the millions of actual repair events it already catalogs, making its unique SureTrack big data repair base even more powerful and customers, shop owners and managers have taken notice. The quarter saw more fleet placements, more attention to industry shows like APEC and more penetration of shops across the country. From our diagnostics division, also selling to independents; another solid quarter, including positive results from our newest handheld unit, the VERUS Edge. I mentioned it last quarter; it was in the midst of its introduction, while the enthusiasm continued from our customers and from our franchisees. It's our most successful launch. Customer satisfaction is high and we regularly receive testimonials when I go out and visit with franchisees and customers and technicians. We receive testimonials like the VERUS Edge, it helps my shop fix cars faster and be more profitable. VERUS Edge is quite a product; faster, easier, smarter. Technical service bulletins at hand, comprehensive diagnostics, and the power of SureTrack big repair data. Simply the best handheld in vehicle repair and is another winner with independent shops, it's clear. And speaking of diagnostics, this time in the heavy truck area, we continue to expand our coverage. More engines, more power train combinations. The PRO-LINK Ultra, already the go-to diagnostics in truck shops across the nation, got stronger again. Finally, in the period, RSI Equipment Division recorded essentially flat activity, impacted particularly by Eastern Europe. That said, we keep driving to expand our position in equipment with repair shops. With innovative new products like the B1200P wheel balancer system, designed for more sophisticated independent shops with specialty or a dealer-like operation. A series of customer connection with those locations help us highlight the need for features like fast run-out measurement, automatic data entry via scanners and Smart Sonar, a pin-point laser light for positioning the adhesive weights on the wheel, and a highly intuitive and rapid touch screen interface. The B1200; faster and more accurate. It's now available in European markets and the North American introduction is scheduled for later this year. So, that's RS&I using Snap-on Value Creation, authoring innovative new products, capturing opportunities and securing an expanded presence with shop owners and managers. And that's our fourth quarter; organic sales rising 3.1%; EPS, $2.22 in the quarter, up 12.7% against the $0.11 of unfavorable currency; progress along our runways for coherent growth; and clear advancements down our runways for improvement; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, driving a 19.1% operating margin, 220 basis points higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $851.7 million in the quarter were up 3.1% organically, reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, notably, the Snap-on Tools Group, as well as our diagnostics and repair information business, partially offset by some headwinds in our C&I segment. On a reported basis, net sales, which included $33.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased $5.7 million or 0.7% from 2014 levels. As you know, Snap-on has significant international operations and is subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Largely due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q4 sales comparisons by 400 basis points. Consolidated gross margin of 48.4% in the quarter improved 40 basis points primarily due to higher organic sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $250 million yielded an operating expense margin of 29.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 180 basis points from last year, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower performance-based and stock-based compensation expenses. No restructuring costs were incurred in the quarter. We incurred $1.1 million of such costs in the fourth quarter of last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $162.3 million in the quarter, including $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 11.8% as compared to the prior year and as a percentage of sales, improved 220 basis points to 19.1%. Financial services revenues of $63.1 million in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2014 levels and operating earnings of $45 million increased 6.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $207.3 million in the quarter, including $9.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6%. And the operating margin of 22.7% improved 230 basis points from 20.4% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 31.1% compared to 32.1% last year. Finally, net earnings in the quarter of $131.4 million or $2.22 per diluted share increased $15.2 million or $0.25 per share from 2014 levels representing a 12.7% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on slide seven, sales of $281.8 million in the quarter decreased 0.6% organically, primarily due to a high single digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely reflecting deep declines in sales to the military and to customers in the oil and gas sector. These organic sales declines were partially offset by a low single digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a double digit increase in the segment's power tool operation. Gross profit in the C&I Group was $107.6 million in the quarter. The gross margin of 38.2% increased 20 basis points as savings from RCI initiatives and lower restructuring costs were partially offset by a shift in sales that included lower volumes of higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries, and an increase in lower gross margin sales from the power tool operations. Operating expenses of $65.7 million in the quarter compared to $72.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 110 basis points primarily due to a 70-basis point gain from the sale of a former manufacturing facility, as well as benefits from the sales shift already mentioned. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.9 million, including $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 3.5% from 2014 levels, and the operating margin of 14.9% improved 130 basis points. Turning now to slide eight, fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $411.2 million increased 8.7% organically, reflecting continued strength in sales both in the U.S. and internationally. Gross profit of $173.7 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from 2014 levels. The gross margin of 42.2% decreased 70 basis points primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $101.8 million in the quarter decreased slightly, and the operating expense margin of 24.7% improved 170 basis points principally due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $71.9 million, including $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.5%, and the operating margin of 17.5% improved 100 basis points from 16.5% last year. Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on slide nine, fourth quarter sales of $280.6 million increased 2.2% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships. Sales of undercar equipment were essentially flat year-over-year with continued weakness in East European markets, including Russia. Gross margin of 46.7% improved 20 basis points from 46.5% last year. Operating expenses totaled $58.9 million in the quarter, and the operating expense margin of 21% improved 240 basis points, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $72.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.6% from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 25.7% improved 260 basis points from 23.1% last year. Now, turning to slide 10, in the fourth quarter, operating earnings from financial services of $45 million on revenue of $63.1 million, compared with operating earnings of $42.2 million on revenue of $59.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.8% compared with 17.6% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $252 million in the quarter increased 8.5% from 2014 levels. Moving to slide 11, our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 80% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In 2015, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $206 million. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. Now, turning to slide 12, cash provided by operations of $144.4 million in the quarter increased $47.2 million from comparable 2014 levels, due in part to higher 2015 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $74.6 million included $66.8 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $16.1 million in the quarter compared with $17.3 million last year. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $80.4 million. Turning to slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days compared with 61 days at 2014 year-end. Inventories increased $22.3 million from 2014 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions, as well as the addition of inventories related to the acquisition of Ecotechnics. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.5 turns compared with 3.7 turns at 2014 year-end. Our year-end cash position of $92.8 million decreased $40.1 million from 2014 year-end levels. The net decrease include the impacts of funding $844.2 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $127.9 million, the repurchase of 723,000 shares for $110.4 million, $80.4 million for capital expenditures, and $11.8 million for the acquisition of Ecotechnics. These cash decreases were largely offset by $624.8 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $496.5 million of cash from operations. Our net debt to capital ratio of 24.6% compared with 26.3% at 2014 year-end. In addition to our $92.8 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. At 2015 year-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. This concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. Now, briefly review a few outlook items for 2016. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2016 will be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full year 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2015 full year rate of 31.7%. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on's fourth quarter, an encouraging period; taking advantage of tailwinds, overcoming headwinds, growing organically, improving performance significantly, again. There is turbulence, deep decreases in the military and oil and gas and difficulties across the geographies. But there are tailwinds. The aging and changing of vehicles continue, so vehicle repair remains robust. In this environment, we keep driving down our strategic runways for growth, launching innovative new products and advancing our position. And despite the difficulties, we continue moving down our runways for improvement. Snap-on Value Creation, safety and quality. Customer connection and innovation working better and better. We had more new hit products in 2015 than ever before, not just for the Tools Group but for the corporation overall. Runways, growth and improvement, authored 3.1% organic growth in the quarter against the wind. EPS of $2.22, up 12.7% over last year's fourth quarter, against $0.11 of unfavorable currency. And a 19.1% OpCo operating margin, a rise of 220 basis points, all extending our ongoing upward trend that has continued for some time. And we believe that the strength of our business model, the power of our brand and the capabilities of our team position us well to continue that positive trend as we go forward. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll say a word to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are hearing this call. The encouraging results of our fourth quarter and the year and our potential for continuing the encouraging trends reflect your capability and your dedication. For the success you've achieved, for your contribution to our future and for your commitment to our team, you have my congratulations, you have my admiration and you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to Tom Hayes of Northcoast Research. Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Good morning. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Good morning. Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Yes. Nick, I was just wondering maybe you could talk a little bit more or provide a little bit more detail on the critical industries side. Certainly, military and oil and gas has been kind of a challenge in the year. Maybe talk about the cadence as it went through that quarter and then the outlook for 2016? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Well, I mean, I think, we're seeing deep declines in both of those places. We're talking multiple double digit declines in the military again and oil and gas in particular. If you're talking about the outlook we've set for some time that military \u2013 those two businesses are driving C&I in general. If you look at C&I beyond those businesses, it grew by about just over 5%. So, you see how much they influence the situation. So, you say to yourself, well, what's going to happen with those businesses? And we've said for the military for a long time that it's uncertain. And so you say to yourself, well, that uncertainty is dependent on the government situation and so we're poised to take advantage and it could come back in a short-term or it could continue for a while. In terms of oil and gas, I think we're seeing a historic downturn, 70% decline in the business. I mean, in the oil price just in the last \u2013 in a recent time. And we haven't \u2013 we saw that at the big recession in 2009. We saw at the Iran-Iraq War. So, it's kind of an unusual situation. When that comes back, I expect oil and gas to come back. Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. And maybe just a little bit... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: On the other hand, as we said in our release and our comments, aviation was pretty good for us in the quarter. So, you see some goes-ins and goes-outs, but the dominant factor in those businesses are the oil and gas and the military. Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then maybe just a question on the expense line, the operating expense was down meaningfully. How much of the decline was tied to \u2013 you called out less stock-based comp, how much of that was contributed to the decline? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't know. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Let's say about 20 basis points. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yes, 20 basis points. The big thing, if you're looking at operating expenses, there's quite a few goes-ins and goes-outs, but a lot of that is RCI. But also, if you step back last year in the fourth quarter, we talked about the \u2013 there was a 53rd week. But 53rd week, in general, if I looked at it from the trajectory of the corporation, it was kind of not significant. It wasn't significant. It shouldn't change your view of where we're going. But if you start to look at it on account by account, it, of course, becomes an issue associated with the operating expenses, because you have that extra week of operating expenses. You start to look at accounts, you had an extra week of sales, 1.7% extra sales, but last year, so that wouldn't be an issue. But if you step back and look at it, we don't think the 53rd week was significant, in general, or would change your view of the corporation. But if you look at it on account, like operating expense, it really is a factor. And you have currency in operating expense as well. So, you have those things rolling through, RCI, currency and things like the special events of last year. Thomas Hayes - Northcoast Research Partners LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Up next, from Longbow Research, we go to David MacGregor. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, everyone. Nick, can you just talk about demand patterns in January and any deterioration that may be visible beyond critical industries? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: We almost traditionally never talk about the current quarter. We never give guidance. But I will say, look, I will say, that I was just on a van out here in Addison Itaska (37:03), and I have to say that when I talked to the people in the field, both our franchisees and the customers \u2013 you get out of a van and you go from \u2013 you know this, you go from shop to shops. They all seemed very positive and that might stop with the positiveness and the optimism that I saw at the kickoff meetings. We have a lot of these around the country. And I was at one of them and the rest of our staff was at others and they come back, and certainly, we're seeing a qualitative view of optimism. And so, I can offer that. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Is there \u2013 just within that SG&A pullback, notwithstanding it was 70 basis points in the C&I business, I guess, I get that. But how much of that was just attributable to the weaker military and oil and gas business versus what may have been in that number in terms of structural cost takeouts? And I guess, also, can you say to what extent there may have been some cost items that were pushed forward into 1Q or pulled back into last quarter's... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't think we did that. I think \u2013 look, I think if you look at \u2013 if you're talking about \u2013 are you talking about the 130 basis points of margin improvement in C&I? David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : I was talking about the $16 million of SG&A drop, which was great. But I'm just trying to get a sense of what the nature of that was. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: That's overall, though. The $16 million is overall. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Right? That's not just for C&I. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Correct. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: And that didn't have much push or pull. What's in there is, like I said, you had currency, a big number of currency, with the currency year-over-year affects that SG&A and shrinks it. You have RCI. You've got \u2013 as somebody mentioned before, you have some goes-ins and goes-outs in terms of pension going the other way, compensation going one way. And you also have the 53rd week last year which was an extra week of operating expenses. Like I said \u2013 and so, therefore, the comparison issue isn't favorable, you get paid back at the sales line for that because the sales ends up being a little bit smaller. But if you look at it \u2013 I don't want to \u2013 I want to focus that, if you look at that one account, you start to see the effect of the 53rd week. If you look at it in total, it wasn't much of an effect for us. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Last question, just if you could talk about the trends you're seeing in tool storage and whether you're seeing a deceleration in demand patterns. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: No. No. Our big ticket items in total, we never talk particularly about tool storage, but our big ticket items in total were up a little bit more than the tools did (39:27) in the quarter. And I don't see that, really. I really don't see it. We haven't identified any particular cooling of that activity. Now, from quarter-to-quarter, these things always change. But I don't see as a downturn. Like I said, our big ticket items continued. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Great. Thanks very much. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Liam Burke of Wunderlich. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Hey, Liam. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Good morning. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Nick, can you give us a sense \u2013 you had a good year in new product introductions and hit products. What can we look forward? I mean, are you continuing to see growth in that area with more new introductions to create more hit products? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yes, I am. But, look, I hate to pin myself to the rack of continual increases in million-dollar hit products. I'm trying not to do that. But that's our drive. I can tell you this. We're getting better and better at customer connection and innovation. And if you think about it, a complex product line (40:37) 65,000-plus SKUs is asymmetrically (40:40) enabled by new technology like 3D printing and finite element analysis and some of the other things like X-ray diffractometers, which is new to us, and electron microscopes and so on. So, from a design point of view, we're getting better, so we don't have to put as much upfront into every product. And from a calling-the-airstrikes point of view, in other words, reacting to customer connection, we're getting better. And that has authored the continual improvement of our hit products. This year, it was up again. I would be aiming to bring it up next year, but we're not \u2013 it's not something we always report about. But I think every year, our new products become more impactful and more effective. I mean, just look at the VERUS Edge. The VERUS Edge is simply the best product available in diagnostics. And diagnostics is a rising category. It's faster, smarter, easier to use, and it gives you handheld access to our unique millions of records in \u2013 database of millions of records that allows technicians to shortcut the repair process. This is revolutionary, and that's just one thing. We pointed out the prybar today in our \u2013 now, we use the prybar for a reason. The prybar is just \u2013 it's a prybar, yet customer connection and innovation showed us how to make that long-standing category so much better. That's what's happening in Snap-on. That's what's driving the business for us. And it works in the Tools Group. And we're confident it's going to work for critical industries, although there's turbulence as you can see in critical industries with oil and gas. I mean, oil and gas, I think, we \u2013 oil and gas, and military, we never \u2013 we always said that our penetration was low and we wouldn't see an impact, but we didn't contemplate going from $115 oil to $30 oil, which is cataclysmic. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Okay. And with the end markets in the automotive repair continuing to grow, are you seeing any change in the competitive front? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't think so. I listen to the same publicity that you would listen to. And so people are \u2013 I think it's a robust market, so there's room for everybody to have some kind of good news in this market. But, when I go out \u2013 and I checked this the other day with our people, when I go out to the franchisees around the vans, they don't talk about the competitors. They talk about our business and how we can make it better. So I don't think we're seeing any kind of change at present. I rode on a van where the guy talks about the numbers of competitors that left his route, in other words, gave up the business and went out. He keeps track of it, but that's all. I mean, he doesn't worry about the competition. He worries about himself. He worries about, well, okay our \u2013 things like, questions like, our power tool is actually a lot better than our old power tool, the one I replaced. Or maybe it isn't as good. We need to make it a little bit better. Those are the kinds of things we talk about. Or how much our productivity advancements like providing \u2013 for the vans, providing a mobile tablet for van drivers, a couple of mobile tablets for a van. 570 of our van drivers have assistance and the mobile tablet allows them to spread both the principal and the assistant out into different areas, greatly increasing their reach. They talk about that and the efficacy of that. They don't talk about the competitors. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Nick. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Operator : From Barrington Research, we'll go to Gary Prestopino. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Hi, Gary. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Couple of questions here. I know somebody asked this about million-dollar products, but, Nick, could you maybe quantify what was the growth in million-plus products that you put out this year versus last year? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I'm not going to actually quantify. I've tried to avoid quantifying that, and I'm not going to change that in this call. But I would say it was up this year by a reasonable margin. In fact, you might even call it a substantial margin in terms of what was launched. So we had a pretty good year in terms of new products. And remember, what I have said is that the number is now five times or six times what it was in 2006. That's a pretty... Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: ...good number. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Pretty good increase. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. And you would anticipate that, obviously, you're going to continue to try and strive to put out more new products, especially -- Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. The whole point is yes. I'm probably not going to slit my wrists if it doesn't increase as much next year, you know what I mean? But certainly, we do target that and that's part of our plan. We would expect that to happen. We put the capabilities and the elements in place to make that happen. And we're getting \u2013 it's simply, Gary, we're getting better at it. We're getting better at it. You can see it in the Tools Group numbers. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: You know, okay, 8.7% against 1% or 2% GDPs. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Right. Can you maybe \u2013 we've \u2013 at least we think that you've had a recovery here for -- we're going into year seven, especially in the U.S. and the automotive market. Is there anything different that you're experiencing in this recovery versus maybe prior recoveries in your experience with Snap-on? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Actually, no. I don't think so. Actually, the recovery has been going on since 2009 and so I don't think so. I do think automotive repair, which is 70% of our business \u2013 70%-plus of our business -- is relatively robust determined by the aging of the vehicles and the changing of the vehicles which isn't interrupted so much by economics. And so, I think automotive repair is in a good place and makes us resistant to these \u2013 not immune to these kinds of changes, but resistant. I don't see any change there. Look, I think, if you look at other geographies and industries, they go up and down like you see in oil and gas and in military, like in anybody else, but I don't see anything different about those that I haven't seen in a number of different ups and downs except that maybe the oil and gas (47:37). Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Hello? Oh, Jesus. Operator : Please stand by, while we reconnect with our speakers. One moment. Once again, ladies and gentlemen, please stay on the line. [Music] (48:27 \u2013 48:37) Please stand by, as the speakers are joining. Give us just one moment. And you have rejoined. Please continue. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Hello, Gary, are you still there? Operator : Yes, Gary, your line is open. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yes. Sorry. What did you hear last? Sorry. We got cut off here, I guess. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: No. That was fine. I think we were talking about just maybe differences in the recovery, what you're seeing. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yes. I don't think that much. I mean this is just \u2013 I mean certainly oil and gas is a bigger downturn than anybody's seen in a while. It's unusual, right? But other than that, I don't think so. This isn't our first rodeo. So, we've seen it. And automotive repair seems to be chunking along, I think. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then one last... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Doing pretty well. Sure. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: That's good to hear. One last question for Aldo; in terms of your international sales, they run, what, about 25% of your business, right, somewhere around there? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Yes. That's a \u2013 I think you have Europe is about 18% of the mix and emerging markets add another 10%. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: That's what I'm getting at. In terms of currencies, the currencies that really impact you would probably be the pound, the euro and then what else? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: You have it pretty much right. If you're looking at the sales line, Gary, the most important currency that creates a headwind is the euro. In addition to the euro, you have the Canadian dollar. Lot of people forget about that, but the Canadian dollar, the British pound would be the next most significant ones. When it comes to the bottom line, we have more natural hedges throughout the continent of Europe. So, the euro actually has less of an impact on the bottom line. The biggest impact to our profitability is actually the Canadian dollar, the British pound. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. So, the Canadian dollar and the pound are on (50:37) Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Gee, that's why you see most of the impact manifesting itself in the Tools Group. If you think about the Tools Group is largely a sales footprint. So, they don't have a lot of cost that enjoy the benefit of the haircut in the weaker currencies in the United Kingdom and in Canada or Australia for that matter. So they don't enjoy the protection that you get where you have a euro-based organization. There's a lot more cost that decrease in U.S. dollar terms. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yes. The Tools Group was up 17.5% \u2013 was up 100 basis points. But that was against 70 basis points of negative currency. So, you can see where that affects, okay? Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-on Inc.: Sure. Operator : We'll go next to David Leiker, Robert W. Baird. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink in for David. Unknown Speaker : Hi, Joe. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): The one slice of C&I that I don't believe you commented on yet was Asia. Any updates on growth rates or trends from the Asia Pacific region? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: It was mixed in the quarter. China was weaker than we've seen in a while. And so, we had China being weak and we had some \u2013 whereas Indonesia had been weak before. Indonesia was up, India was up, so we kind of had a balance there in terms of our mix in Asia Pacific, China being more difficult in this quarter. We see a lot of variation from quarter-to-quarter in Asia Pacific. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And in China, is it possible to determine \u2013 this will sound strange, but if a slowdown in new vehicle demand, which may actually cause the fleet to age a bit ultimately ends up being more beneficial to Snap-on? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't know. I don't think so. I mean, I kind of think the cars that are there in the park, they're going to age anyway. I don't think that the cars or the new cars that are being purchased are making the old cars go away. That's what I think. I don't think they're shipping those overseas to any big extent. Now, I could be wrong about that, but that's our general impression about China, it's a lot of different markets and a lot of different areas. I think the slowdown would probably help some, but I don't think it would be as big a factor as you might think. It's usually the size of the park. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then one last one on C&I. Is there any correlation in the military business for Snap-on to the wheeled vehicle programs getting rolled out? So if JLTV production starts ramping at Oshkosh, does Snap-on typically see a benefit in their defense business? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Well, I don't know if we've tied to particularly Oshkosh or something like that, but certainly, wheeling out of new programs help us a lot. For example, the F-35 is a help to us, the fighter vehicle, the fighter, because we have a lot of the business associated with supporting that for both production and for repair. So that kind of program is an underlying program. But across the programs in the defense department, particularly around the projects, around with those new products, that business is very weak \u2013 was very weak this quarter. If they launch new products, like you say, a wheeled vehicle product at Oshkosh, that provides an opportunity and we're well-positioned to take advantage of that. So those kinds of programs, new vehicles do help us. But I don't know... Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And so... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I don't know if you can just trace it to an Oshkosh program. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): No, no. I was thinking more broadly on the programs that you commented on. And so, is it, maybe, fair to say the duration of this pullback in military spending might be shorter than what's Snap-on dealt with in 2012, 2013, around the sequester? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yes. Gee. I don't know. I think the government business is kind of uncertain. We've said, the military business was up in the quarter \u2013 up in the first two quarters. And we said we knew it was going to be uncertain. And now when it's down, I still say the same thing. Certainly, the things you're talking about. New programs are going to help and would shorten the cycle. That's true. Stabilization of the budget would help. It may be not as chronic as the controller of the prior cycle, but I can't really say for sure. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : From Jefferies, we'll hear from Bret Jordan. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Good morning. This is actually David Kelley in for Bret this morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of quick follow-ups on RS&I here. And I guess first regarding the flat undercar sales you mentioned. I know U.S. service chain reported a fourth quarter comp decline and largely due to some mild winter weather conditions along the East Coast. Just wondering if you saw some weather-related headwinds in the quarter and I guess how was domestic undercar performance? And how do we think about that segment going forward given the robust auto repair market we're talking about and really some of the significant miles driven gains we've seen over the last three months... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Yes. Look, there's a lot of goes-ins and goes-outs in the undercar equipment business. First and foremost, that flatness is impacted by Eastern Europe. Among all our businesses, the undercar equipment business had the strongest position in Eastern Europe and Russia. So, the dips in those places impacted that business as just squeezed down to a smaller place the most. That's number one. In terms of the other businesses, of course, weather can be a factor in undercar, and that might have been \u2013 say, it might be entitled to some of that in the fourth quarter and some of that bad weather. And then the other thing is, it was up quite \u2013 our undercar business is a longer wave business. It isn't just a quarter business. When we have a good quarter like we had in the third quarter, sometimes you'll have resources devoted to installation of those new products, flowing into the next quarter which will put a weight on the next quarter. So, you see those three things rolling through it. I would expect \u2013 to your question about the longer-term, I expect that undercar repair will follow along with the generally robust vehicle repair market in the U.S. and in Europe as the cars get older. And by the way, as the cars get lighter and need more fuel economy, the precision of balancing and alignment needs to be stronger. So, we're very positive about the long-term future of that business, and we have a major share of it. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : All right, great. I appreciate the color. And then, just quickly, if you can provide some, maybe, color around the 260 basis points margin expansion for RS&I just wondering how much of that is basic blocking and tackling around these RCI initiatives that continue to provide you, guys, tailwinds here? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Well, RCI is a big dollop of it. And then, of the 260 basis points, I would say, you've got a little bit of negative currency, and you got about 70 basis points or so, what I would call favorable mix. As you follow us over time, you will see that RS&I has quite a variation from business to business in terms of operating margin. It could be thousands of basis points. And so, what happened in this quarter is we had another strong quarter of diagnostics and Mitchell, the business to independents which are high margin business, and a reduction of the hardware business which is equipment. So, that generated that 70 basis points, or so, of help from business mix. So, that's what you're seeing. RCI and business mix. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : All right, great. Thank you. And then, just a final one from me and this is more kind of a big picture thought question here. You're mentioning sales to OEM dealerships were up again single digits. And I guess as we think about maybe being on the back end of a cyclical recovery in new vehicle sales, do you think there might be a shift in dealership ordering patterns of equipment, either they're focusing more on parts than service retention or maybe they're spending less due to a flat retail sales market? How do you think about the dealership channel over the next... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: I'm not sure. Having worked in the auto industry for 11 years myself, I would say that's a hard call. I mean, I don't think you can make a lot out of this. I guess, we were saying mid-single digits or low single digits in the OEM dealership business this quarter. But I don't think you can make a conclusion on one quarter. Some of that got driven by programs out of OEM manufacturers, the essential diagnostics and so on. I do think you make a point that as new car sales attenuate, dealerships tend to focus a little bit more on parts and service. I think that is true to the extent that the time constants on which that rolls into our business, I'm not sure. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : All right, great. Thanks for taking my question. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Operator : David MacGregor of Longbow Research has a follow-up question. Please go ahead. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Just a follow-up, Nick; somewhere within your portfolio, there's got to be a line of business or a product or some franchise that serves as a pretty reliable leading indicator for you. And I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you're seeing leading indicators in your business and basically what they're telling you. There's obviously some concerns here about your ability to sustain growth in 2016. I just wanted to give you an opportunity to talk a little bit about why you're feeling confident to \u2013 certainly in the first half of 2016? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Well, our leading indicators are pretty much what we hear from our franchisees and what we see about the programs in terms of the changing of the vehicles and what we hear from our franchisees about their outlooks for the demand in their businesses. You can go out and talk to them, and the leading indicators are, gee, are we providing the kinds of tools that would solve the new problems that are coming on the horizons in the independent garages? Now, this isn't a quantitative leading indicator, but it's been pretty reliable for us. And so what we see is the optimism coming out from them saying, boy, I think things are good and the fact that we our new product portfolios, our innovative new products are solving more problems than ever. Those are the kinds of things and that hasn't abated. So, I feel pretty good about that business. And in terms of the other businesses, I just think we also feel good about our growing strength in the critical industries. It's just that you see some very big headwinds in some of those critical industries. And I can't predict where those are going to go. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Can you just remind us again what... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: On the other hand, I will just offer that, we've seen up and down before and we've been able to grow profitability against the winds; not every quarter necessarily but in terms of a trend. We view our situation as a trend. If you go back and you look at our numbers from 2006 onwards, sales and profits, the trend continued and even through the recession, and the dip in the recession, that trend continued. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : So, you continue to see growth in your future-dated orders? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: We don't have future-dated orders, really. We're not a future-dated order business. So, we don't have much of an order backlog. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: We don't have that kind of thing. We have to rely on the kinds of things I've talked about. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Okay. And just last question. Can you just remind us what critical industries represents as a percentage of total C&I? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: It represents about I'd say 40%. David, you can say given for government worth, it's $450 million business roughly, right? David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Right, right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Okay. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks, Nick. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Sure. Operator : And our final question today will come from Richard Hilgert of Morningstar. Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Research : Congratulations on a great quarter, guys. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks, Richard. Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Research : Just wanted to get your feel for what you're seeing in terms of puts and takes with some of the issues that we're facing right now on the new car side of the business. We're seeing diesel being a big issue right now. We're seeing hybrids being a big issue. We're seeing active safety coming into play over the next couple of years. I would imagine that with more and more electronic control, there's going to be more opportunities for diagnostics, maybe, but also I'm wondering on the Tools side, if there's any opportunities there. What's some of the puts and takes that you're seeing with all these changes coming down the pike? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Actually, Richard, all of those things are positive for our business. When the vehicles change, that requires new tool loads, new electronics, new undercar equipment to deal with the changes. If you just take one and if you think about self-driving vehicles and things like that, I mean, the more people rely on internal mechanisms inside the car, the more precise calibration has to be, and therefore, the more careful and more detailed the mechanical job is, the mechanics have to be. And so if it gets more electronic, there's opportunities for diagnostics. If it gets more attended to onboard computers to control the car, more equipment and more diagnostics. And, ironically, during the time in which the cars have electrified, it's gone from \u2013 in the 1990s, it went from 50, 60 engine codes for a car to now thousands of engine codes. In that time, demand for hand tools has only increased because the reparability of the car is so far down in terms of the design considerations that the cars have become more and more difficult to physically repair, let alone diagnose associated with electronics. So, all of those things are good for us. We see a very positive future and trend, and we're confident. That continues the trend that you see in our numbers. If you look at our numbers and you see over periods of time, sales and OI margin, continual trends in good times and challenged times. Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Research : Great. Thank you very much. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-on, Inc.: Okay. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Leslie Kratcoski for closing remarks. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-on, Inc.: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. A replay of today's call will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we thank you for your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : And again, that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for joining.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please, go ahead. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks, Lindy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's first quarter results which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website under investor information. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. With that said, I'd now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks Leslie. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I will start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter and along the way I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we made, and on what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. We believe that our first quarter provided confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming headwinds, advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our EPS in the quarter was $2.16, up from last year's $1.87. That rise includes an opco operating margin of 18.6%, an increase of 190 basis points. When you combine those opco gains with earnings of $47 million from financial services, it bring Snap-on's consolidated operating margin to 22.5%, up from the 20.1% in 2015. And that EPS, $2.16, it represents an increase of 15.5% over last year. That improvement came on an organic sales growth of 2.5% and the continuing contributions from our Snap-on value creation processes, the suite of principles we use every day around safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. Once again, you can see it in the results, those processes contributed strongly to the earnings climb. Our reported sales in the quarter of $834.2 million were up 80 basis points, and that gain included 200 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Now currency has been a headwind for some time, both to sales and profit, but we've been able to overcome with the help of Snap-on value creation, especially with innovation and with RCI. Innovation; taking practical insight and matching it with the latest technology, generating product excitement while making work easier for professionals with an array of new products. You see, that's been part of our DNA from the very beginning in 1920, and we are only getting better at doing it. There are more new products than ever before. RCI; ongoing improvement, finding operating efficiency and achieving cost reduction, up and down and across the corporation. Innovation in RCI; overcoming the challenges, extending the trend of rising profits again. Now let's consider the markets, the markets we serve. The first quarter once again highlighted the extensive opportunities of the auto repair segment, more solutions to service the growing complexities of new vehicles requiring advanced solutions. And an aging fleet, driving more repairs, both factors in play not only in the United States but worldwide and the numbers of our quarter reflect those tailwinds. They show and -- they not only reflect the tailwinds, they show our ability to take advantage to progress down our runways for growth. Consider the tools group; organic sales up 8.1%, clearly enhancing the van channel, providing innovative new tools to engage continually changing tasks, making work easier for technicians and our franchise team more prosperous and more powerful. And repair systems information, or our RSI group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, capitalizing on a broader product line, growth across all the divisions but most notably in diagnostic and repair information businesses, in the diagnostic and repair information businesses serving independent repair shop owners and managers. C&I it includes the businesses that serve critical industries and is the most international of our groups. And in the quarter the results showed the challenges of turbulent industrial sectors and the difficulties of a few trouble geographies. In critical industries, the headwinds from the fourth quarter continued and they were a bit more pronounced. Sales to the US military and to oil and gas customers were down significantly with both segments showing the impact of ongoing measured spending and budget constraints. At the same time, we saw dips in some international markets, specifically the Middle East, where aerospace project activity was down due in part to macro development in that turbulent -- in that region, pretty turbulent there. That said, all that said, C&I did demonstrate strength. SNA Europe delivered mid-single digit growth in places like the UK, Spain and the Nordic region, while Asia Pacific registered double-digit increases in countries like India, Thailand and Indonesia. So overall I'd describe our C&I market as mixed turbulence and strength. Deep challenges, but we're also encouraged by the advancements, taking advantage of the opportunities that are available. And when coupled with the string of positive performances surrounding our auto repair related businesses, on a whole, we believe there is clear progress along our runways for growth -- enhancing the van network, expanding repair shop owners and managers, building in emerging markets, and yes, extending to critical industries. Even in this quarter, we can see progress in our growing product line, in our increasing understanding of the work, all of that creating confidence in our forward trajectory across those critical sectors. That's the overview of the markets. Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were down 1.3% with declines in the critical industries attenuated by gains in SNA Europe, Asia Pacific and the power tools division. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.1 million, representing an operating margin of 14.3%, a decrease of 50 basis points, pretty much authored by lower sales in our higher margin critical industry business. But as I said, we do remain committed to extending in critical industries and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture new business as the segment improves. You can see this particularly in our innovative new products, fortifying our ability to make work easier outside the garage in a range of industrial settings. One new product family in that category is -- in our collection is the Snap-on three-quarter inch flank drive 12 point impact socket. You pick these up, they are a handful, big, but effective and durable, aimed at power generation, mining and oil and gas sectors; perfect for turning large bolts on wind turbine engines, earth-moving equipment, oil wells, multiple other places, anyplace where heavy work gets done. They are ideal for pneumatic or hydraulic bolting systems and they incorporate Snap-on's flank drive which move stresses away from fastener points, delivering more turning power right in the field without slipping or rounding off a fastener. Those sockets are made down in Alabama at our Elkmont plant, and they are a great addition to our tool line, they fill a vital need for our critical industry customers. Now in past quarters, I'm sure you may remember that we discussed Snap-on's lineup of tool control solutions, safeguarding the assets and improving productivity. I've spoken about our innovative and sophisticated automated tool control system, or AGC, the smart tool storage unit which electronically keeps track of the who, the when, and the where of individual tool usage, it's popular. In the quarter, our industrial division introduced its latest and another version of tool control, the Snap-on 5S Dual Visual Control Cabinet. The 5S Dual, off-the-shelf or custom-built, utilizes visible control trays to quickly identify missing tools with the help of custom cut foam or with CAD-designed tool silhouettes. It's the perfect addition to any place where work is performed within the site of tool storage, like assembly line, and where the shop is aiming to drive improvements through 5S or RCI. And I mentioned the strength of SNA Europe and the continuing new advancement there was clearly evident in its mid-single digit sales gains, marking now ten straight quarters of year-over-year sales progress across several challenged geographies. And once again, sales rose but profits were up more, now the 12th straight quarter of margin improvement. And speaking of gains, our Asia Pacific division, an area of strong potential and these days of significant variation, we're building our physical capabilities and we saw progress in the quarter with sales rising compared to last year. So now onto the tools group; organic sales increased 8.1%. The operating margin of 16.6% was up nicely versus the 15.8% recorded last year. The tools group, the results continue to speak for themselves, ongoing progress along their runway for coherent growth enhancing the franchise channel. And there is abundant evidence of growing strength and of ongoing positive trajectory across that channel, all on display in our franchisee metrics, important financial and physical indicators like cash, like turnover, we monitor those metrics very closely and again this quarter they are favorable across the Board and they continue to trend upward. There is also evidence in sort of anecdotal and direct interaction with the franchisees at events this year like our January kickoff meetings held all over the network, orders were up considerably, and atmosphere, enthusiasm and optimism and a team marked by commitment and energy. When you meet our franchisees, you clearly see they are brimming with confidence, reaching higher and expecting to achieve and grow. The tools group was marked by growth, but it was also driven by Snap-on value creation. It's always a critical component of the group's progress, offering [ph] innovative new products, sometimes just an improvement on an established line but making work easier, solving new problems, delivering productivity gains from observing the work in shops on a daily basis. An example of that is our Snap-on 312 CF heavy-duty diagonal cutters manufactured up the road in our Milwaukee plant, the next generation of our most powerful diagonal cutting pliers, utilizing Milwaukee sophisticated cold forging technology. They've been redesigned for better overall strength, substantially increased cutting performance, and longer life, more precise cutting edges and a repositioned pivot point for increased leverage. The 312, using both those edges in a new leverage, the 312 CF cuts material ranging from plastic cable ties to hardened spring steel, tremendous versatility. And the pliers head has been improved. Our designers better pinpointed the failure points, added material in those places, reducing the breakage, tip breakage, even when these pliers are engaged in the toughest task. And we matched it all with the latest in Snap-on cushion grips. Our customer connections showed that there was a great need for pliers with improved versatility, durability, and comfort. The 312 CF provides just that, and we expect strong sales, even in an established category. Also in the quarter, the tools group introduced the low-profile swivel impact socket set. Now we've been selling sockets for a dog's age, a long time. But this new set expands our line of confined space solutions with a reduced height, provides better -- that reduced height provides better access to fasteners, great for tight engine compartments, underneath dash spaces and any difficult to reach area. The new design also features laser welded pivot points and the weld beads are machines flushed to the socket for improved appearance and safety. It adds a smooth full 30 degree swivel action for more efficient power. Power and access, just what's needed for the tight spaces and the challenging tasks of today's more complex engine compartments. Snap-on innovation; a tradition in Snap-on since 1920, but we believe getting much better helping technicians perform their work more efficiently and enabling solutions in a rapid changing environment. But the tools group is not just product, it's also based on amplifying the capability of our franchisees and the power of our network. The Rock n Roll pads and the Techno Express are great examples of that. But now we are also enabling our team with the Chrome Express Plus System, supporting multiple mobile terminals. A number of our franchisees have chosen to add an assistant to the route. While Chrome Express Plus enables that add, making it possible to multiply selling time and to reach more customers, it's another clear opportunity for more growth. And we can't talk about tools group without speaking of its strategic partner, our financial services team, tapping the power and insight of our franchisees, financing big ticket sales, serving as a great assist to our tools business and you can see it in the strategic relationships playing out vividly in the quarter's results. Now let's speak of RS&I first quarter organic sales rose 3.1% led by sales to independent shop owners and managers, operating earnings of $69 million, up $5.1 million from 2015. The operating margin, 24.7%, a rise of 120 basis points. RS&I we're clearly seeing the power of RS&I -- RCI, rapid continuous improvement, driving margin expansion, it's evident again in this quarter in the strong earnings. I often speak of this, the successful handheld -- our successful line of handheld diagnostic units, well received in the market, driving growth throughout independent repair shops. In the first quarter, that advantage was again highlighted publicly. Our SOLUS Edge and our ETHOS Tech handhelds were honored by Undercard Digest, both recognized by that magazine as a Top 10 tool. The SOLUS Edge, faster processing, larger screen, the power of Mitchell 1 SureTrack, all combining for the fastest fixes. It's the tool for experienced technicians. And the ETHOS Tech with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, great for the first-time diagnostic buyer. Both handhelds were selected by the votes of technicians and shop owners who use these tools every day and who read Undercard Digest. One clear reason why the RS&I margins have continued to climb all these quarters is the ongoing stream of innovations made possible by customer connections with professional tool users. An example of that in this quarter, RS&I launched its shift -- launched and shipped its new advanced touchscreen diagnostic workstation. It features our most powerful diagnostic tool, the VERUS Edge handheld, and it's paired with a custom roll cart for easy mobility and a large 27-inch touchscreen monitor for increased readability and productivity. This workstation, all of this visibly reinforcing independent repair shops capabilities, building that customer confidence, so important in an environment of rising vehicle technology. In addition this quarter, our equipment division launched what we believe to be a game changer, the V3300 wheel aligner, a next generation unit targeted specifically at specialty shops and dealerships, faster readings, real-time data to the technician and a significant reduction in cycle time. We've already received enthusiastic feedback in just a few weeks from a wide range of potential customers and we are confident it's another share taker. Finally, RSI continued its expansion into the heavy-duty segment, strengthening the Snap-on Pro-Link Ultra's position as the go-to handheld in big truck shops, adding coverage, enhancing functionality and building and expanding presence in the heavy-duty repair shops across the U.S. So that's the highlights. Continued progress; organic sales rising 2.5%, gains achieved through Snap-on value creation processes, especially innovation in RS&I, strengthening our businesses and driving to an 18.6% opco operating margin, up substantially. And in the face of currency and industry headwinds, EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%, it was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Our first quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.2 million were up 2.5% organically, primarily reflecting increases in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. On a reported basis, net sales, which included $16.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $2.6 million of acquisition related sales, increased $6.4 million, or just under 1% from 2015 levels. Largely due to the strengthening of the US dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q1 sales comparisons by 200 basis points. Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% improved 30 basis points from 2015 levels as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $259.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.2% in the quarter, an improvement of 160 basis points from last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation and other expenses as well as lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $155.4 million, including $7.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency FX, increased 12.7% as compared to the prior year, and as percentage of sales, increased 190 basis points to 18.6%. Financial services revenue of $66.3 million in the quarter increased 15.5% from 2015 levels and operating earnings of $47 million increased 16.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $202.4 million, including $8.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 13.6%. And the operating margin of 22.5% increased 240 basis points from 20.1% a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full-year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $128.3 million or $2.16 per share increased $17.8 million or $0.29 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 15.5% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with commercial and industrial, or C&I, group on Slide 7, sales of $287 million in the first quarter decreased 1.3% organically primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries. This decline was partially offset by a double-digit increase in the segment's Asia-Pacific operations, a high single-digit gain in the segment's power tools operations, and a mid-single-digit sales increase from the segment's European-based handtools business. Gross profit in the C&I group of $110.5 million compared to $116.5 million last year. The gross margins of 38.5% decreased 70 basis points primarily due to a decrease in higher gross margin sales to customers in critical industries and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $69.4 million in the quarter compared to $72.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of 24.2% improved 20 basis points from 24.4% last year. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.1 million, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 14.3% compared to 14.8% last year. Turning now to Slide 8, first quarter sales in the Snap-on tools group of $402.5 million increased 8.1% organically, reflecting a high single-digit gain in the company's U.S. franchise operations and a mid-single digit increase in the company's international franchise operations. Sales gains continue to reflect strong demand, including for big-ticket items such as tool storage and diagnostics. Gross profit of $173.2 million compared to $166.3 million last year. The gross margin of 43% decreased 100 basis points for the most part due to unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses were $106.5 million in both the first quarters of 2016 and 2015. The operating expense margin of 26.4% improved 180 basis points primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 50 basis points of lower stock-based cost associated with the Company's franchisee stock purchase plan. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $66.7 million, including $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.9 million and the operating margin of 16.6% improved 80 basis points from 15.8% last year. Turning to the repair systems information or RS&I group, shown on Slide 9, first quarter sales of $278.8 million increased 3.1% organically. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products, a low single-digit increases in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $131.6 million compared to $127.3 million last year. Gross margin of 47.2% improved 40 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $62.6 million in the quarter compared to $63.4 million last year. The operating expense margin of 22.5% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. First quarter operating earnings for the RS&I group of $69 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $5.1 million from prior year levels. And the operating margin of 24.7% improved 120 basis points from 23.5% last year. Now turning to Slide 10, operating earnings from financial services of $47 million on revenue of $66.3 million compared with operating earnings of $40.3 million on revenue of $57.4 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared with 17.7% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables was 9.5% in both periods. Originations of $264.6 million in the quarter increased 14.7% from 2015 levels. Moving to Slide 11, our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.6 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.4 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 81% of our US financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first quarter of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $53.3 million, continuing to reflect the previously mentioned higher sales of big-ticket items like the Snap-on tools group. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operations of $141.6 million in the quarter increased $63.5 million from comparable 2015 levels due in part to higher 2016 net earnings and lower growth in working investment as compared to the prior year. Net cash used by investing activities of $79.6 million included $56.8 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $19.5 million in the quarter compared with $18.1 million last year. Turning to Slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 61 days compared with 60 days at 2015 year-end. Inventories increased $13.8 million from 2015 year-end levels primarily to support continued higher customer demand in the auto repair sector and new product introductions. On a trailing twelve month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end. Our quarter-end cash position of $106.3 million increased $13.5 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $174.1 million of cash from collections of finance receivables, and $141.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $230.9 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $35.4 million, the repurchase of 157,000 shares for $23.1 million, and $19.5 million for capital expenditures. Our net debt capital ratio of 23.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. In addition to our $106.3 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of the first quarter end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. This concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. That's our first quarter, performance against the wind. We believe it's a period that authors strong confidence going forward, authoring or auguring progress along our runway for both improvement and growth. Enhancing the van channel, the tools group grew 8.1% organically and the OI margin reached 16.6%, up 80 basis points. Franchisees confident and committed, a stream of exciting new hit products and a continuing line of ways to wield the van channel more powerfully, the Rock n Roll CADs to the Techno Express and now the Chrome Express Plus enabling the franchisees to reach more customers. Expanding repair shop owners and managers. Sales up 3.1%. OI margin rising 120 basis points to 25.7%, great products. The V3300 aligner, the ETHOS and the SOLUS handheld meeting the growing complexity of vehicle repair. Building in emerging markets, expanding the physicals, sales increasing in a varying landscape. And finally, extending to critical industries. Turbulence, but we still see progress. Clear to us in terms of expanding product lines aimed at solving the critical in those sectors outside the garage. And you can't look at our quarter without seeing the hallmarks of Snap-on value creation, driving improvement against the difficulties, authoring an OI margin of 18.6%, up substantially versus last year, again. And when you add that opco performance to our financial services progress, it rolls together for an EPS of $2.16, up 15.5%, extending our trend of rising profitability, a 15.5% rise in what most would call a turbulent environment. We believe it was an encouraging quarter, and one which points clearly to continued and significant gains as we move forward. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, it's appropriate that I say words to our franchisees and associates. Once again, I know many of you are listening, the progress of our first quarter most clearly reflects your extraordinary capability and your unique dedication. For the skills you bring to our company, for the energy you devote to our efforts and for the commitment you give to our team, you have my admiration and you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Please go ahead, your line is open. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. The auto repair and maintenance end market seems to be working in your favor. The macro trends seem to be strong now and sustainable. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment? Nicholas Pinchuk : Not really. I'm sure -- you know, we have a fairly strong position in these markets, as you know. And generally, as I've said many times on these calls, built on I think the overwhelming capability of our van network and the skill of our franchisees, and the ongoing understanding of the repair shop, we generally reflect back on ourselves. So when I talk about franchisees, they almost never really mentioned the competition although I'm sure is formidable. They mention about how we can improve back on ourselves. And I'm seeing no change in that really. And I think the tools group numbers seem to say that. Their numbers look pretty good. They continually make this up. They've been up 6% or greater 23 of 24 quarters. One of the things I like to say about that, I think one of the investment theses about Snap-on is that Snap-on is a company that is so much more -- so much more to do, so many more places to grow and improve. And the tools group, the van channel, has been around for decades, and yet they have been able to do this by creating a bigger plume and being able to expand so dramatically by creating a greater plume of new product and figuring out through things like these Rock 'n Roll cads and Techno Express and now Chrome Express Plus, how to wield those vans more effectively. That's what's happening with us in the market. Liam Burke : Thanks Nick. And also on the diagnostic side, you mentioned the handheld as some of the key product introductions and innovation you're getting there. If you look at the diagnostics business in general, is most of the growth coming out of handheld or do you have some innovative products coming into the service station owner and manager? Nicholas Pinchuk : If you look at RS&I we are getting growth in a broad range. Diagnostic stuff is growing very strongly. If you look at big-ticket items in the tools group, which is the bigger diagnostics and the tool storage and so on, they are up higher than -- they're growing faster than the tools group. So that looks pretty strong. We keep innovating around handhelds, and that's of course some of the spiffy stuff people like to talk about because people want more diagnostics as the cars get more complex. But also if you look at equipment, you will see that in terms of the new aligners we brought out. And behind the aligners, there's an array of new balancers and so on. And then finally, we keep enhancing our software product like this SureTrack, which accesses hundreds of millions of actual repair events and allows technicians to pinpoint the possible repair and shortcut to that repair through big data. That's an exciting product which is going into the garage at the same time. Liam Burke : Great. Thanks, Nick. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go next to David Leiker with Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open. David Leiker : Good morning everyone. A couple of things I want to walk through. In C&I, you still have I think at least another quarter here of tough comps year-over-year. Is that right? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, look, I think at C&I if you look at this, I think you could say you'd be allowed to the fact that oil and gas gets -- it wasn't as we did in the first quarter last year, if you remember, in oil and gas. The second quarter started tail off. So I think oil and gas tends to get a little easier moving into the second quarter. But military was strong and international aviation was strong in the second quarter. So we still have another quarter of batting up against that. It tends to get easier in the third and fourth quarter. I don't want to say easier, but it tends to be less high of a bar. David Leiker : Yes, and if I remember correctly, your fourth quarter for oil and gas, energy, military, that Q4 tone was slightly weaker than Q3. What does it look like in the first quarter versus Q4? Nicholas Pinchuk : It's weaker. Both of those are weaker in the first quarter than they were in Q4. I think marginally. I'd say marginally weaker. It's somewhat weaker though. It's hard to say, David, because you've got fourth quarter over first quarter. You might have some mild seasonality flowing through that, but I would say mildly weaker. David Leiker : Do you think when we get to that point through these comps in the second half that they are more normalized, that those businesses are down single digits instead of double digits? Nicholas Pinchuk : I'm not in the business of forecasting that, but certainly we'd come back to substantially lower comparisons. And so that by arithmetic changes the whole situation. And then remember, we keep investing in those businesses. We brought out -- I just want to point out, we had a tough year in the military, and we brought out over 700 new products aimed at the military. So, we keep positioning ourselves for this, so we are ready to go. We are all dressed up. When the party comes, we are ready to dance. David Leiker : And then Aldo, just a question for you on currency, a lot of details you split out there. Is there a way that you can, on the EBIT line, split out how much of that currency effect was translation versus transactional currency? Could some of these cross-currency relationships seem to be a little bit out of balance with what we normally would see? Aldo Pagliari : We do. I don't want to actually give the internal calculus around that number, but I think, to help you out, as you look forward looking at today's currency rates, transaction will be the greater burden that affects the EBIT calculation so to speak and translation abates a little bit as you go forward using today's rates if you march forward in time. David Leiker : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open. David Kelley : Good morning everyone, this is David Kelley in for Bret. Thanks for taking my questions. And a couple ones, and first I guess a follow-up to an earlier question. The US franchisee base posted really another excellent quarter here. And I know there's been some discussion of a sequential slowdown through Q1 from an aftermarket distributor that reported earlier this week. Is that something that impacted you at all either from your franchisees or let's say RS&I sell-through to the non-dealer channel? And I guess to that point, could you give us maybe a general feel for cadence and tools and RS&I performance throughout the quarter? Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't think we want to give you cadence throughout the quarter, I don't think \u2013 look, I think we are not seeing -- I wouldn't say we are seeing any marked change in the auto repair related businesses. When we go, either in our numbers or when I go out and visit the garage, when I ride these vans. One of the interesting things about our view of the economy is this, is when we look at -- we parse it between auto related and the industrial. We did it in my remarks. But you know, I think one of the fascinating it's about today's environment is it's big to small -- I mean small-to-big. If you're out in the small garage, if you're out in these garages, they are feeling good. They are confident. They are great. So those businesses, the small businesses, to us in our sectors seem uniformly to be enthusiastic and confident and doing very well. As you rise in the size of business, the amount of cautiousness increases. And you can see that in our businesses as well. So when we are selling to the garage from garage to garage, from dealership to dealership, we see good things. When we are engaging with let's say the OEMs or the manufacturers, that's a little bit more tepid. But to answer your question directly, at the grassroots level, we are not seeing any abatement in this. In fact, our franchisees are only getting more confident as far as I can tell. David Kelley : Great. I really appreciate that color. And I guess just a quick follow-up. As you talk about the grassroots movement and the strength at the garage level, what do you see as the better opportunity in 2016? Are we selling more to the mechanics or the shop owners with some of diagnostic equipment? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, actually, it merged a little bit because what's happening is that it used to be that much of the bigger diagnostic equipment was sold to the shop, and it was spread around. It was shared between technicians. What's happening now is while 40% to 50% of the repairs in a -- of the car-park, the 300 million car, vehicle car-park, 40% or 50% of those repairs require a diagnostic unit. 80% of the new car repairs require a diagnostic unit. So every technician is going to need a diagnostic unit from that ETHOS read and reset to all the way up to our VERUS PRO that will solve the most puzzling of problems. And so we are seeing more sales now to individuals. But we are also seeing -- that's the market situation. But RS&I has only within the last, let's say within the last five or six years started -- five, six, seven years -- started to focus on repair shop owners and managers as a particular customer base. So, you see that opportunity unfold for us as we learn what they need, and we arm our quiver with more products. We give us more to sell to those guys. So I would say the market is going really robustly for the technicians. Shop owners and managers are still buying but we have a particular share gain opportunity with owners and managers. David Kelley : Okay, great. Thank you. And then one more for me and I'll jump back into queue here. Can you maybe give us some color on the impact of the lower stock-based compensation and pension expense on corporate expense? And then if we think about the last few years, you've run I think roughly $100 million annualized corporate expense. How do we think about the full-year run rate for 2016? Nicholas Pinchuk : I think we kind of give guidance around $25 million a quarter or so on. So it's interesting. Last year in the quarter, we had a particularly expensive mark-to-market event that drove corporate expense up. I think it was $29 million and change. This year, we had a particularly favorable one which brought it down to $21 million and change. Really the $21 million compares to a $25 million run rate if you really want to think of it in those terms. If you talk about operating expense, yes. In operating expense, there's that mark-to-market and the pension expense that's in there that's making some of the improvements in operating expense. What we do is when we look at our numbers, we say this, yes, we've got good news from mark-to-market but we got bad news from currency. They about balanced, mark-to-market and pension currency, and we still grew EPS at 15.5%. David Kelley : Great, I appreciate the color. Thanks again. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. David MacGregor : Good morning, everyone. You caught my attention with the observation of franchisees adding help on the van, and that should drive sales productivity. Do you have a count on -- I know you've got 3,500 trucks running in the United States. Nicholas Pinchuk : That's a ballpark, it's 3,475. I don't know that number. It's written on might shorts here. That's why I see it every morning. David MacGregor : Do you have a figure on growth, just to what extent you are selling\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : No, I don't want to get in the business of reporting that, but let's just say that that is a small number so far. In the 15% to 20% range of the franchisees have those as systems. As you know, most of them -- and it's a franchisee's choice to make the decision. We enable it with things like Chrome Express Plus and other things. But what I see when I go to these kickoffs or go to the National Franchisee Advisory Council and talk to these, the more the franchisees see the success of other people with these assistance, the more they say, hey, maybe I could do this. I could hire new guys. I could reach more customers. I can increase my sales. And they are looking at that because, now, having grown for 23 out of 24 quarters 6% or greater, they want this growth. They expect it and so they are looking for things which could make their businesses better. David MacGregor : The other question I had for you was just the disparity in growth rates between your originations on the credit business and the tools growth. And I'm just wondering if you can talk were there any changes within the credit model and the extent to which this has helped you with your most creditworthy customers, drive\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : Look, I think there are lots of things floating through here. It depends how long wave you want to look at it. If you look at it in any one particular quarter, you are talking -- first of all, you are talking big ticket items. So, big ticket items in this particular quarter, tool storage, big diagnostic and so on, they grew faster than the tools group, so it's hard to match that. Plus there's a timing question and then a sales tech on top of it. So there is a lot of things that goes on in the individual quarters. If you are saying have we wielded credit more effectively or more broadly, we have, because what we've done is we've spent a lot of time determining, determining, determining who are our best franchisees, and how they are good at credit. There's been no change in the credit model really. There's been no change in the credit model. But we have done a great job I think of using those franchisees who have the best instincts and insight and capability around credit, and enlisting them in the credit company to advance this kind of activity. David MacGregor : You have a history of managing credit very effectively, so I was more focused on the extent to which this may put more purchasing power in the hands of your customers to buy bigger ticket items going forward. Nicholas Pinchuk : There is some of that, but we haven't really changed it. It can make it possible for certain people who couldn't get credit before, who happen to be in a route that's superintended by one of the people that we now think is a great credit guy, what we call a Platinum Elite guy. That could make that change. But generally we've kind of held it. We've kind of held that model I think, except for this engaging the knowledge of the franchisee. David MacGregor : Got it. Thanks very much. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : And our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Gary Prestopino : Good morning everyone. Nick, is the Chrome Express Plus, is that the program of putting assistance on the vans? I'm a little confused there. Nicholas Pinchuk : You know what it is? The Chrome Express Plus is an adjunct to our new computer system. Several years ago, we rolled out a new computer system, point-of-sale system, for the van. And then more recently, we have added Chrome Express Plus, which allows mobile, tablets, multiple tablets to roll out from the van. And what I am saying is the franchisees, the franchisees have looked at their situation and realized that, boy, they would like to add selling time. So they have made the decision, on an individual basis pretty much, it has been a grassroots effort, to try to pick up assistance. And then this Chrome Express Plus is a response to that help enable them. We don't have a program to bring on assistants. We are not sponsoring a program or anything like that. It's fundamentally the franchisees themselves because after all these are independent businessmen who make these decisions. But we have created Chrome Express Plus that really leverages -- if you have an assistant, chrome express plus really helps you. And it really helps the assistants that is there. That's what I was trying to say. Gary Prestopino : Okay. I was just a little confused on that. And then on the diagnostic side, interesting comments about -- you are saying number of cars or amount of cars that now need some kind of diagnostic usage and repair. But is there something within these diagnostic products that you are putting out that make older ones more obsolete? Is it just computing power, amount of information they can show? I'm just trying to get an idea of how long one of these techs can use a diagnostic tool effectively before he or she has to switch\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : In a way, Gary, it's a little bit like a TV. You could still be using a tube, I suppose, but every time there are two pieces here. One is software, we keep updating software. I want to say a couple of times a year we keep updating software. Then we bring out so you could be having an existing handheld and keep updating the software, keep updating the software. Eventually that software might not be run so effectively on some of the older models. That is one, so you would want to change. Secondly, again, it's like a TV. We bring out the newer models, and they have features, touchscreen feature. The new SOLUS, you turn it on, it comes on in like seconds, five seconds. The older one was slower. VERUS Edge, you can get technical service bulletins. You go out on the Internet and you get SureTrack on it, different capabilities. By the way, it's about -- it's substantially lighter and better ergonomics than it was. So you have these two things going on. So if you behold one of these new diagnostics, and this happens all of the time, because people say, gee, I'd really like to use this; it is a lot lighter; it would be effective for me; it's a lot quicker; it's more easy with a touchscreen. So people tend to want to upgrade. So we keep enhancing those. And there is software on top of it. Gary Prestopino : Thanks. And just for Aldo, did I hear you right that you said currency has negatively impacted net earnings by about $8.1 million this quarter? Aldo Pagliari : That's correct. That's the bottom-line impact. Gary Prestopino : Okay. So in terms of translation, which currency is going to have more impact as we go forward? Is it the euro or the pound? Aldo Pagliari : The euro historically would be the biggest currency, and in 2015 was the biggest decrement to sales. That is starting to wane now as the euro has stabilizes. So as you go forward I think you look at the pound and the Canadian dollar will start to factor in, but I would say that's my best description right now, Gary. I think you'll see less translation negative impact coming from the euro, yet within the Company, there is still some transaction drag that's created from the currency mix that we have. Gary Prestopino : Alright, that's what I thought. Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Please go ahead, your line is open. Richard Hilgert : Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. How are you? Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning. How are you? Richard Hilgert : Doing well, thanks. And thanks for taking my questions this morning. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Richard Hilgert : I just wanted to go back to a couple of things. The corporate expense line for coming to operating earnings, that was an $8.4 million reduction from last year to this year. And did I hear you right, this is related to pension expense but it sounded like you were talking about currency too. So am I to assume that this is the\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : No, there is couple pieces to that, one is of course pension expense, it's between -- I think that's between $1 million and $2 million, something like that. And the rest is principally marked-to-market around the stock-based compensation. So basically when the stock price goes down, you get good news. When it goes up, you get a mark-to-market. So what happened last year is a little bit misleading because last year -- that difference is versus last year, and last year the stock price went up in the quarter. So we had bad news in mark-to-market. And so you are comparing the bad -- the good news this year with the bad news last year, and so you get an expanded number in the $6 million range. Richard Hilgert : Okay, got you. So mark-to-market on the stock compensation expense. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Richard Hilgert : Alright. And then on receivables in the finance group, you guys did a great job bringing on receivables that were up 17% in the quarter. So really good loan origination going on. I'm curious. You mentioned earlier about Premium Elite status franchisees. Is this because of their efforts to increase the credit portfolio, or is this driven because there is a different mix in what loans are being originated or\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : No, no, no. What this means is this is the kind of framework which we've had for some time. The broader characterization is Platinum. These are people who are engaging in the credit program. They are spending time thinking about how to deal with credit. And the better guys, the top end guys, are what we call the Platinum Elite. And what this really means, Richard, is certain franchisees can judge credit, can add to our credit model. We have -- our credit process is like this Richard Hilgert : Okay, great. And it sounds like these guys, being more adept at credit policy, are better able to identify potential risks that even though you're penetrating your market more so on the finance side, the risk that you are taking on hasn't changed. Is that a fair statement? Nicholas Pinchuk : Any other -- most other credit facilities, through the eyes of these people, we actually know the borrower very, very well, and that's the essence of how we keep the losses down so low. Richard Hilgert : Okay, very good. Thanks again for taking my questions. Nicholas Pinchuk : Okay. Operator : And this concludes our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Leslie for closing remarks. Leslie Kratcoski : We appreciate you joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on Snapon.com. And as always, we thank you for your interest in the company. Good day. Operator : And this does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you and have a great day.",

Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Operator : Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Snap-on Incorporated 2016 Second Quarter Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski, Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, ma'am. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's second quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer, and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under Investor Information. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs, or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. This presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or they substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our Q2 earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I'll start this call with some of the highlights of our second quarter. I'll speak about the general environment and the trends we see, and I'll take you through some of the progress we've made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. Our second quarter was encouraging, and we believe it once again offered evidence of clear advancements that along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Reported sales were up 2.4% or to $872.3 million and that included unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter, an impact of $10.2 million. It also reflected an incremental $5.9 million from last year's Ecotechnics acquisition. Now, organic sales for the quarter rose 2.9%. OpCo operating margin expanded by 140 basis points and earnings per share, they reached $2.36, up 16.3% compared with the $2.03 the last year. The OpCo operating margin reached 19.1%, up from 17.7% in 2015. And that 140-basis point increase reflects a higher sales, but it also represents the power of Snap-on value creation. For Financial Services, operating income grew to $49.5 million from last year's $41.4 million, combining with OpCo to drive our consolidated operating margin to 22.9%, up 180 basis points. From an overall macro perspective, the automotive repair arena remained strong and that can be seen clearly in the businesses serving that sector, the Tools Group and the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group. They continue to make progress in the quarter both in and outside the United States. The Tools Group organic activity increased 5.8%, once again demonstrating its ability to expand on our already-strong position, leveraging a stream of new products and innovative solutions, capturing more business by helping technicians keep pace with changing vehicle technologies and with the aging fleets. In RS&I, organic gains of 5.2%, higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, increased volumes with OEM dealerships, expanded activity in undercar equipment, and broad progress in most regions. For the Commercial & Industrial Group \u2013 well, for Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, organic sales were down 2%. Results were mixed across our industrial sectors and geographies. And in critical industries, headwinds surrounding our military business remained, spending stagnation from Washington continued in the quarter. We also witnessed ongoing inactivity within the Middle East. Aviation customers delaying project work due in part to the turbulence throughout that area, that region. That said, there were positive industrial sectors, in places like U.S. aviation and power generation, where we made progress based on our understanding of the tests, our increasing understanding of the tests and our extending product lines that enable that work. Also a positive for C&I, SNA Europe advanced. SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering positive results, broad strength across the core of Europe, in places like the U.K., Germany and Spain, in a period when the word Brexit entered our vocabulary accompanied by uncertainty. So the overall results remain positive, strength in vehicle repair, mixed performances from critical industries and advancements against the wind in Europe. Opportunities outweighing the challenges and the sales growth confirms it, and the operating income clearly demonstrated the leverage and the power of Snap-on Value Creation, our Snap-On Value Creation Processes in safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. In this quarter, special note should be made at customer connection and innovation, keeping pace with the aging car part and the changing technologies across the workplaces of the world. And another broad trend, as we move toward automatic control and more drive-by-wire, is the growing need for more precision in mechanical adjustments and more insight into data trends. Snap-On innovation is responding to that opportunity and the products that support the need for precision and insight help drive our sales and our margins in the quarter. Customer connection and innovation and in fact all of the Snap-on Value Creation Processes helped us advance down our runways for improvement everyday driving our 140-basis point OI gain and overcoming the challenges. So that's the overview. That's the macro overview. Now, let's turn to the groups, let's move to the groups. We'll start with C&I. As I just said, a 2% organic sales decrease with lower critical industry activity and higher volume at SNA Europe and our Asia/Pacific and power tools operations. The operating income margin was 13.8%, a 50-basis point decrease impacted principally by the reduced sales in the higher-margin critical industry business. For the Industrial division, we had headwinds, but as we said, we also had sectors of growth. U.S. aviation sales were higher bolstered by innovative new products like our latest in Tool Control solutions, the Automated Tool Control locker. You may remember, our ATC smart toolboxes, visually keeping track of workplace hand tools. Well, the new ATC locker brings that asset control to a regularly shaped items, like extension cords, toolkits, and plastic or fabric carrying cases, personal protective equipment, all common in aviation shops. The new ATC locker makes tracking those non-standard tools easy and reliable, and like the smart box, the ATC locker is fully networkable. It enables tracking from a central site, displaying the tool control status for easy surveillance and avoidance of foreign object damage. Avoiding foreign object damage are really important feature in those critical aviation applications; we can all relate to that. And based on the early reception, we believe we have a winning extension to our flagship tool control line with this locker, doing well. Now, we often speak about customer connection, direct observation of the work and guiding new product innovation based on that observation. While the Industrial division is constantly introducing new products, born out of that value creating process. One example is our SGDE series of electrostatic dissipative screwdrivers, great for places like avionics maintenance shops or any critical application where static discharge can damage sensitive equipment, special conductivity to dissipate static and in a rotating handle mechanism that's ideal for precise, detailed electronics work. Safety and precision, two special needs made clear by direct observations at aviation MRO back shops across the world, customer connection and action making work easier in the aviation sector, that's what these screwdrivers are. Another customer connection, this time the offset crowfoot adaptor for the specially configured fasteners at power generation sites. It replaces homemade welding tools that frequently break and damage those high-voltage insulators \u2013 we've all see them on the top of transformers \u2013 damage that equals critical failure. Visiting those substations, observing the work, we also saw Frankenstein-like modified tools, welded out of multiple tools, trying to do the transformer task and we knew we could do better. So we designed a Snap-on professional tool, that's more durable, safer and easier to use. It's a great attraction in power generation and it's products like that, that are behind this quarter's positive results in that sector. Now, let's speak about SNA Europe. During the double-dip in Europe, we said we would use RCI energetically and we did. But we also said we wouldn't reduce capacity. Well, that faith is paying-off. SNA Europe registered its 11th straight quarter of year-over-year sales growth, a positive trend in a very uncertain economic environment of Europe. And profit, Q2 marked the 13th straight quarter of margin improvement. SNA Europe up again in sales and in profit. Our Asia/Pacific operations also contributed positively and we kept investing in that region, more products, more distribution, more capabilities, positioning to take advantage of that building potential. Well, that's the C&I story, turbulence in certain critical industries partially offset by progress in other divisions. Now, let's move to the Tools Group. Organic sales were up 5.8%, reflecting mid-single digit gains in the U.S. and internationally. Operating margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points, overcoming 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. That 18.3% and 120-basis point rise, it's a clear demonstration of our improving position and progress along one of our most important runways for growth, enhancing the van channel. The advancements are evident in the sales and in the margins, and perhaps most importantly in the overall franchisee health metrics, which are all trending positively again this quarter. We believe our franchisees are growing stronger armed with an array of innovative products. Products like the new 1/4-inch Drive Extra Long Flex Head Ratchet. At 10.5 inches, it allows technicians to work in difficult-to-reach spots under the dash, in tight engine compartments or anywhere that access is limited, and it combines our patented dual pawl system with a finely machined 72-tooth gear, more power in less lateral space at a distance. It's manufactured in Elizabethton, Tennessee, in our Elizabethton, Tennessee tool plant, and it's the next in the series of extra-long handle tools, designed specifically to make the technicians toughest jobs much easier and we believe it does just that. And early sales have been robust. Now, we've been making torque products for some time. In the second quarter \u2013 but in the second quarter, we launched the heavy-duty 0.5 inch drive mechanical torque wrench. We call it the Brutus, the Brutus 300, targeted at technicians servicing larger vehicles. It solves a critical need, making it possible to torque a wide range of fasteners using a single tool in places where a number of special tools would normally be required. Today, the trend I described, many larger vehicles, large SUVs and pickup trucks, responding to the need for more precise specifications require a wider range of torque, some in tight places, some on buried components, some above 250-foot pounds, big components like brake calipers, pitman arms, and wheel hubs. Previously, a technician would go through a time consuming multi-tool procedure or sometimes just torque by judgment. The Brutus uses Snap-on's unique metallurgical capability to reach in the farthest places, fit in the smallest spaces, but have the strength necessary for larger torque values, all in a relatively light package for less fatigue. It's manufactured at our plant in City of Industry, California. It's long, small, light and strong responding to a growing need for precise torquing in larger vehicles. Along with the innovative product, the Tools Group has another special advantage, our Financial Services arm, Snap-on Credit, strategic program aimed at supporting those essential big ticket purchases. The credit company is focused on enhancing our van network and again this quarter it did just that. So that's the Tools Group. New products guided by customer connection driving sales growth and strong margins. Now onto RSI, solid across the group, organic sales growth of $14.2 million or 5.2%, operating margin 25.2%, rising 80 basis points, broad-based progress, operation-by-operation, the diagnostics and information businesses selling to independent repair shops driven by our award-winning handheld diagnostics products and by our extensive database of repair solutions. Whether it's the top of the line, VERUS Edge with its comprehensive diagnostics, technical service bulletins, and the power of SureTrack big repair data for advanced professionals and working on those really difficult repair, whether it's that big VERUS Edge for advanced professionals or for the entry-level technician, the ETHOS Tech with its considerable functionality and attractive price point, the Snap-On line-up of handhelds makes work easier across the garage. Some of today's vehicles now have over 100 electronic control units, all requiring service, so the demand for diagnostic tools and data insight is rising. And to support those growing complexities, our Mitchell 1 team continues to refine its ProDemand product, expanding make and model coverage, adding the most recent vehicle platforms, broadening search results, improving navigation, providing even more shortcuts to a quick fix with its SureTrack big database, all of it saving the technician's time. The Mitchell 1 solution gets better every quarter, and we see it in the results. In sales undercar equipment, also up mid-single digits with growth registered in the U.S. and our international markets. The U.S. gains included a particular strength by a pair of our recent acquisitions, the Challenger Lifts, and Pro-Cut break lathes, both expanding the Snap-on presence in the garage, and both progressing well in the quarter with products like Challenger's versatile CL12 lift, 3-stage Low Profile arms from more flexibility, and Pro-Cut's new X9 on-car brake lathe, more positioned in rotor matching, more repeatability of \u2013 stay calibrated over thousands of cuts. The trend in vehicle repair, more precision, that means more wheel alignment and more rotor matching and Snap-on has the products that make it easier. Speaking about hit products and alignments, last quarter, I mentioned the launch of the V3300 wheel aligner. I said it was a game-changer, and so it was. Based on it \u2013 so it was, based on the enthusiastic reception from many prominent dealer networks, now with the full quarter in the book, the results are in and the sales have been strong, and it's no wonder. We spoken about the trend to more precision and that means more frequent alignments, enabling some of the new features like lane departure systems or adaptive cruise control and the V3300 fits that trend. More alignments are in the future and the speed and the accuracy of the V3300 is a great asset. So to wrap-up RS&I, we see it as a confirmation together with the Tools Group of the strength of the auto repair market. RS&I great diagnostics, new repair information and expanded offerings of undercar equipment, all driving positive trends and improving our position with repair shop owners and managers. Well, that's the highlights of the quarter. Growth and improvement. Progress, along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancements down our runways for improvement. When you step back and you look at these numbers, sales increasing organically by 2.9%; OpCo operating income margin of 19.1%, up a 140 basis points; EPS $2.36 in the quarter, 16.3% higher than last year, it was another encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Nick. Our second quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $872.3 million were up 2.4% including $10.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales. Excluding foreign currency translation and acquisition-related sales, organic sales increased 2.9%, primarily reflecting higher sales in our businesses serving automotive repair, partially offset by lower sales to critical industries in our C&I segment. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q2 sales comparisons by 120 basis points. Consolidated gross margin of 49.4% improved 20 basis points from 2015 levels as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $264.9 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 120 basis points from 31.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as lower stock-based mark-to-market compensation and other expenses, and a lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings from Financial Services of $166.4 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 10.3% as compared to prior year, and as a percentage of sales, increased 140 basis points to 19.1%. Financial Services revenues of $69.3 million in the quarter increased 18.1% from 2015 levels and operating earnings of $49.5 million increased 19.6%. These increases primarily reflect the continued growth of the Financial Services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $215.9 million, including $6.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 12.3%; and the operating margin of 22.9%, increased 180 basis points from 21.1% a year ago. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 32% last year. For the full year, we continue to anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full-year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $140.1 million or $2.36 per share, increased $20.1 million or $0.33 per share from 2015 levels, representing a 16.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, on slide seven, sales of $285.7 million in the second quarter decreased 3.4%, excluding $4.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales declined 2%, primarily due to a double-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, largely in the military and international aerospace market segments. This decline was partially offset, by mid-single digit increases in the segment's Asia/Pacific and power tools operations and a low-single digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business. Gross profit in the C&I Group of $111.4 million compared to $112.9 million last year. The gross margin of 39% increased 80 basis points, mostly due to savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives. Operating expenses of $72.1 million in the quarter compared to $70.7 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.2% increased 130 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily as a result of unfavorable sales volume leverage and 70 basis points of higher cost including cost associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $39.3 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $2.9 million from 2015 levels and the operating margin of 13.8% compared to 14.3% last year. Turning now to slide eight. Second quarter sales on the Snap-on Tools Group of $416.7 million increased 4.5%. Excluding $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $22.7 million or 5.8%, reflecting similar gains in both the company's U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $182.1 million compared to $176.5 million last year. The gross margin of 43.7% decreased 60 basis points, largely due to 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $105.8 million in the quarter compared to $108.5 million last year. The operating expense margin of $25.4% improved 180 basis points primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of lower stock-based cost associated with the company's franchisee stock purchase program. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $76.3 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 18.3% improved 120 basis points from 17.1% last year. Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on slide nine. Second quarter sales of $295.2 million increased 6.4% from 2015 levels, excluding $5.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 5.2%. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, as well as mid-single digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $137.8 million compared to $129.6 million last year. Gross margin was 46.7% in both periods. Operating expenses of $63.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.5% improved 80 basis points, principally due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Second quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $74.5 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $6.8 million from prior-year levels and the operating margin of 25.2% improved 80 basis points from 24.4% last year. Now, turning to slide 10, operating earnings from Financial Services of $49.5 million on revenue of $69.3 million compared to operating earnings of $41.4 million on revenue of $58.7 million last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 17.9% in the quarter compared to 17.8% last year. And the average yield on contract receivables of 9.3% in the quarter compared to 9.4% last year. Originations of $281 million increased 10.9% from 2015. Moving to slide 11, our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.7 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.5 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 82% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first half of 2016, our worldwide Financial Services portfolio grew $121.3 million. As for finance portfolio loans and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectations. Now, turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $162.1 million in the quarter, increased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 levels. This higher net earnings and improvement in working investment were largely offset by the timing of cash tax payments. Net cash used by investing activities of $95.3 million included $76.9 million to fund the net increase in finance receivables. Capital expenditures of $20.6 million in the quarter compared with $27.7 million last year. Turning to slide 13, days sales outstanding for trade receivables of 60 days was unchanged from 2015 year-end levels. Inventories increased $9.3 million from 2015 year-end levels, mainly to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.4 turns compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end. Our quarter-end tax position of $119.9 million increased $27.1 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $341.4 million of cash from collections of finance receivables and $303.7 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $475.1 million of new finance receivables, dividend payments of $70.9 million, the repurchase of 377,000 shares for $58.5 million and $40.1 million for capital expenditures. Our net debt to capital ratio of 23% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. In addition to our $119.9 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of second quarter-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. This concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's the Snap-on second quarter; continuing the trend of positive performance with ongoing year-over-year gains, runways for growth, enhancing the van channel, and expanding with repair shop owners and managers. Vehicle repair, a space with strong tailwinds, aging car parts, changing technologies and a need for more precision, abundant opportunity, and you can see it in the results. The Tools Group growing 5.8% organically and an OI margin of 18.3%, up 120 basis points. Something we haven't seen. And it was achieved against 80 basis points of unfavorable currency. RS&I in the vehicle repair space, broad gains, growing at 5.2% organically. OI margins of 25.2%, up 80 basis points. Tools and RS&I up again, clear evidence that vehicle repair is strong and it has abundant opportunity and that Snap-on knows how to take full advantage. C&I, battling the difficulties in the military and international aviation, but proving it can extend and advance in sectors like U.S. aviation, power generation and in geographies like Europe where our efforts with SNA Europe are paying off, and all of it combined to author organic growth at 2.9%. The second quarter also bears the mark of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation, creating a growing list of new products to provide higher value, matching the needs for greater precision and performing the work of today and of tomorrow. And RCI, people all over the corporation getting up every day and making our complex business more efficient. Snap-on Value Creation drove our OpCo operating margin to 19.1%. Again, stepping back and looking at the performance and at the numbers, growth up 2.9% organically, performance OpCo operating margin of 19.1% up 140 basis points, a significant rise again this quarter. And EPS of $2.36, a 16.3% increase. It was another encouraging quarter. And we believe that we have the abundant opportunity and the demonstrated capability to continue that positive trend on through the remainder of 2016 and well beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll directly speak to our franchisees and associates. I know that many of you are once again listening to this call. The encouraging results of this quarter reflect the special capability, energy and dedication you bring to our effort every day. For your clear achievement in this period, you have my congratulations and for your contributions and your commitment to our team unfailing, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. And we'll go first to Scott Stember with C.L. King. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Good morning. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Could you maybe just talk about the overall industry backdrop for the automotive aftermarket, doesn't seem to have that much of an impact on your quarter, but just specific to weather and whether you saw any mechanics or end-markets that were backing off on tool purchases somewhat in the quarter? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Not really. I mean, I think, look \u2013 I think, every quarter is different and there are ups and downs in every quarter in terms of the growth and in terms of the types of products that sell and so on, big ticket was very strong. I was just on a van within \u2013 just a little over a week ago and the franchisees and the garages we visited were all very, very optimistic. So I didn't get any feeling from that, from an anecdotal point of view. And then, during the quarter, I met with our \u2013 a group of our franchisees several times from the United States and Canada and so on and they seemed uniformly positive. And when I look at the numbers, I think this market looks like it has looked to us for multiple quarters now, for a long time. So empirically with the numbers and anecdotally from what I get from talking to franchisees and technicians, I think this is pretty positive. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And focusing on the Tools Group, maybe just talk about some of the higher-priced electronics versus traditional tools and power tools, maybe how that trended in the quarter? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah. Well, big ticket items. What we've \u2013 diagnostic sales were strong in the quarter for the Tools Group. We \u2013 you have kind of a secular trend in the market, what I characterize in my remarks is a tailwind, the need for more diagnostics because 40% to 50% of repairs in the parts today need a diagnostic to effect it efficiently and new cars are 80%, so there is a growth toward everybody needing a diagnostic, we see that in our everyday sales and the trends in the market. But in this particular quarter, big ticket items were fairly strong, high value, some of the things I talked about high-value tools that attack precision like the Brutus 300, strong-seller. So the idea \u2013 hand tools in fact were also up very strong. So we saw I think pretty wide strength, but again in this quarter, big ticket led the way. And that's what we expect, because our marketing age around Rock N' Roll Cabs and we've just done a major refurb on the Techno-Vans have kind of support those purchases. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. And just last question on currency. When you would expect to start to see some of the easier comparisons with the... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: For your information, for example, you can look at it this way. In the second quarter, the numbers were in sales, we had about $16 million and $0.09 of currency impact between transaction and translation. In this quarter, we had $10 million and $0.07, $10 million \u2013 just north of $10 million and currency in sales. And I think that's 1.2% or something like that and about $0.07 of currency impact on profitability, 50 basis points in the OI, impacting the OI margin. If you go forward, if everything stayed where it is, for us the pound is a big \u2013 is kind of a big deal. So I think you would say that in the third quarter, the comparisons are such that there would be a slight easing if everything stayed the way it was and then the fourth quarter would get easier I think for us, so that's the way we'd see the year going on, an easing of the pressure of currency, but I think that happens more in the fourth quarter and the third quarter, primarily because of the pound and the pound does carry uncertainty around the exchange rate today and anyway in that situation. But if it stays the way it is today, that's how it'll be. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And just a quick follow-up, sales that are bound by the pound, what percentage of your total sales are coming from that region? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: About 8%... Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: 8% or 9%. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: About 8% or so. And no one knows what the \u2013 what Brexit is going to do. The roll up to Brexit was I think a time of uncertainty. We didn't really see much change, but we're selling into a very basic critical industry, so our people are going to \u2013 I think our people buy. We've even see it. So on a deep recession, people bought the small \u2013 the low payback \u2013 the short payback items, even in the deepest of recession. So it remains to be seen what effect Brexit will have, but we're optimistic about it. Okay? Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got you. Thanks for taking my questions. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Good morning, Gary. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Good morning, Gary. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Nick, what \u2013 you didn't give a percentage on the European hand tools up in the quarter, can you share that with us, or maybe I missed it? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: It was up low-single digits in the quarter. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: So we usually don't give percentages, but we have given it in those kinds of terms, mid-single digits, low-single digits, high-single digits. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: It was up more in profitability. We're pretty encouraged by that though. Like I said, it's the 13th straight quarter growth. And what's really encouraging I think is the growth in core Europe. We haven't seen growth in the core of Europe like this before uniformly. So I am a little encouraged by U.K., Germany and places like that. France, it was encouraging for SNA Europe. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: And then, the previous caller asked a question about currency. Did you say that currency comparisons for the pound should get easier as we go through the back half of the year? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: I said \u2013 what I said, well, hard to predict, you know. I mean, the thing is \u2013 and you got the cocktail of what you sell and all that stuff. But if all things remain equal, what will happen is, is that currency in general will get \u2013 currency in general, the pound becomes more difficult I think as you rollout through the year, but then the other currencies abate. So if you look at the total, it gets \u2013 if everything stays the way it is, and the mix stays the way it is, you end up having a little softening in the third quarter and more softening in the fourth quarter. I think that's the way to think about it. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: (40:43) problematic and in fact it might be... Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: ... more problematic (40:46). Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Right. So would be the Canadian dollar and the euro... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Canadian dollar, Aussie dollar, you know, the euro, the SEK... Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: ...those kinds of \u2013 those kinds of currencies, the comparison simply get easier later. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: And then did you see any disintermediation in Europe post-Brexit for the first couple of weeks of this quarter, can you discuss that at all? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: No. We don't comment on the forward quarter, but I don't really think so. I mean, certainly I'll say this, there was a lot of uncertainty in the \u2013 going \u2013 I was in Europe just before the Brexit vote and there was a lot of uncertainty floating around, around that and we didn't see it impact then, I don't know what will happen going forward. But again, I say, we sell items that solve critical tasks, that tends to be less effective by the economics. It can go up and down in a short period, but I think over time, it doesn't get affected. So I don't really think we expect in that situation. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: If the exchange rate changes dramatically that would have a transactional effect of course. If it affects the interest rates that would have another thing around other than \u2013 in other parts of the corporation, but I don't really \u2013 we didn't see anything so far. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: And then in terms of the Snap-on Credit, it keeps growing in excess of the sales of the Tools Group, are you seeing more of an appetite or are more products being financed by the technician that... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: No, not so much. Not really that. I mean the thing is fundamentally, what's happening in the Tools Group, if you look at it from our perspective and we look at it, you can't look at any one quarter because there is a secondary market and there is a lot of \u2013 that's actually the franchisee sales not our sales, so it doesn't match up. There is a lot of noise from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at overall the last year, the originations are roughly the same as the sales of the big ticket items. So it's being driven by the sale of those big ticket items. And if you've been a student of Snap-on, you know that we have been energizing big ticket sales through we think better product of course in diagnostics and tools storage, but also in terms of the marketing, in terms of the marketing, the Rock N' Roll Cabs and the Techno-Vans. So if I didn't know anything, I would say Snap-On puts Rock N' Roll Cabs and Techno-Vans in it and makes clear cold boxes, I'm going to see high originations because it's going to have a higher big ticket sale. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Nick. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. Operator : We'll go next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the call. Nice quarter, Nick. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Thank you. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Just talking about the growth though in the Tools segment, you guys peaked out in the first quarter of 2015 at about 13% organic growth. And just because of the comping process, obviously that's not a sustainable level and you're going to be coming down. But that organic growth has been sort of settling back down for six consecutive quarters now; you're back to 5.8% this quarter. You talked many times in the past about the long-term growth in the Tools segment, it's probably closer to about 4%. And I just wonder, are we on our way back to that kind of level here in the second half of the year or is there something -? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: I think, what I said is \u2013 I'll say \u2013 I'll make two comments about that. One is, is that, all through \u2013 there has been periods when we grew it like 6% or 5%. During the string of 23 out of 24, I think a year before in 2013, I think, we grew it like \u2013 we threw a bunch of 6%s during that period. So it goes up and down. This is a risk fluctuation. I've said this, I think \u2013 look, I think the Tools Group goes in the 4% to 5% range if based on the tailwind. It's got \u2013 that's a great market, automotive repair is the market, one of the market \u2013 in our model is one of the business models that Saturn (44:59) automotive repairs, one of the great, great markets, you've got tech \u2013 you've got aging of the part and you've got changing its technology, you've got more precision and that will drive us in a 4% to 5% range and things like Rock N' Roll Cab and Techno Express in the system program drives us up into higher levels depending on how effective that unleashes these \u2013 how much more effective that makes the van business. So from time-to-time, we get above this. And I think our ability to grow above the 4% to 5% depends on our ability to keep coming up with those things. That doesn't mean we can grow at every quarter so I think that's how I view it. I think we were at a solid 4% to 5%. But I think if we can keep coming up with ways to amplify our business, the technicians are there. There's 1.3 million technicians, we're calling on 850,000 of them, so a lot of them we'd be hiring every year. So we see a great market there. The other thing I will offer about the quarter, yeah, it was 5.8% but 18.3% OI margins. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : The incremental margins were fantastic and you said... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Try to find one of those in the Tools Group history. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. But... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Now, it's again 80 basis points. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Could you... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: So I guess the less than 6% sales and 7% sales didn't affect the profit \u2013 so they're still bringing the money... David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: ... to the bottom line. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : And you've said repeatedly that during that period of superb growth that you're not too focused on costs, you're more focused on just bringing in the business. But at some point that growth would ease and that's where we will see the margin improvement, just there was a lot of low-hanging fruit. I guess, which is part of why I asked the question, and now you're starting to see the margin growth which would confirm as a milestone that maybe we're at that point where the growth starts to ease. But you also said earlier in the call that you're still seeing strong double-digit growth in originations and originations attracts big ticket. So I guess the question I would next ask is what's easing within Tools, what do you see that if big tickets are holding up, what's easing on you? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, look, I didn't say in the quarter that was \u2013 I didn't match the double-digit growth of big ticket to the \u2013 or double digits of originations in the quarter, because you can't do that. You got to look at it over a longer period. So what I did say was the double digits in 2000 \u2013 of originations in 2015 maxed, almost pretty close to dead-on the big ticket items in 2015. In any quarter, it's hard to say that. I don't think in the quarter, the more robust businesses were around diagnostics, around hand tools. I think we had a dynamite hand tool quarter, but maybe we had a possibly less of a power tools quarter than we did in the prior quarter, that's the kind of characteristic we had. So we had some goes-ins and goes-outs, if you want to look at it by product. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yeah. And you're not adding any more tech or Rock N' Roll Cab Express, so I presume that the storage part of this is starting to level out a little as well, is that correct? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: No. Yeah, yeah. But we actually did add one in the quarter. So went from 66 to 67, I mean, okay, it's not much. Look, I don't \u2013 I think it's one quarter. I'm not saying that \u2013 I'm not \u2013 we don't give any guidance, I'm just saying it's one quarter, so I think it's a little wrong to explain to view it totally as what were the mix in one quarter and, will tool storage go down, I don't think so. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Last question was just you talked on the last call about extending a little more credit to your most discerning franchisees, guys with the strongest track record at dispensing credit. And I'm just wondering where did that credit get put to work in the quarter and where does that show up in the segment numbers, if in fact it did get put to work? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: It shows up in the originations and in the Tools Group, those are the big ticket items. Those guys are wielding big ticket items. So that's part of the support system that allows us to sell those big ticket items. I mean big ticket is basically \u2013 and it has been for Tools, this has been 30 years of this or 50 years, I don't know how long, but it's been since the 1980s at least that they have been and I think longer that they've been financing big ticket items in this way. And what we did, as you said, is \u2013 what we did was just bring striking to the franchisees where we listen more to some guys and listen less to other guys depending on the record to call in the air strikes about appropriate credit. And in the quarter, that kind of \u2013 I think in the quarter, that kind of was relatively stable. But over like the last 18 months, we've had \u2013 we strike more guys that have been better at credit, and they've been able to aid the credit process more effectively. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Thanks very much. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Bret Jordan at Jefferies. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hey, good morning, guys. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah, good morning. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Good morning. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Just to follow-up your comment on the secondary market in the \u2013 on the credit side, I'm just sort of trying to line up the growth in the finance book relative to the growth of sales. Has anything \u2013 and I guess we've decided that there is not an increase in penetration of credit on a transactional base, so you're not lending at a higher rate. It's been more a growth of high-value sales, but then you had a comment about the secondary market sort of creating some volatility there. Is that when your lending on a transaction where a franchisee is selling a used tool they took on trade? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah. Let's take it this way. Yes, that's essentially what it is. But what I meant was, what I offered that comment for is, it's harder to take one quarter's numbers in origination and relate it from originations, the credit action to the actual sale, which is a movement of product from us, from Snap-on Tools to the franchisee. The product moves from Snap-on Tools to the franchisees, it might go into inventory, it might sell directly, and it might ignite say, okay, I've sold you this, Mr. Big Box, it's like 15-feet wide and I took your 7-foot box in trade and I'm selling that, both transactions would be financed. And so while the net, you get a discount from the original for the amount in trade and then that would be on. So the total amount tends to be sort of the same. The timing of those two things can be very different. So a franchisee might end up in his garage, might have three boxes, used boxes waiting there, and then one quarter might roll them all out, might find a seller for them (51:53), you see what I mean. And so... Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Yes, I do. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: ...that tends to distort the timing, not the amount, but the timing. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then back on the Tools, on the contribution from RCI versus leverage, did you discuss sort of what the RCI impact was in the prepared remarks, I didn't hear it? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. I mean, the Tools Group is more or less like this. The OI margin is up 120 basis points and they had 80 basis points of negative currency. The principal offset is RCI. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then one question on C&I. You talked about U.S. aviation and power generation being highlights. Did you say anything \u2013 are you seeing any shifting trends? I mean, energy was a category you used to call out as being challenged? Is there any sign of improvement in some of the other big pieces like energy or mining that have been lagging in C&I? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, mining, I don't think so. Energy, generally, oil and gas is still lagging, but not by the mammoth proportions we saw in the in the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year. So that came back a little bit. That got better. And for C&I in general, as we go into the third quarter and fourth quarter, we start to get into, I'll say less demand in comparisons in military and in international aviation as well. So you see that kind of effect going on. In terms of the quarter-to-quarter business, we saw \u2013 I think we saw rays of hope in places like U.S. aviation and power generation. And general industry seemed to be fairly nice in the quarter. So we're encouraged by that, but I'm not \u2013 given the fact that we're down 2% in the quarter and down more in the critical industries, I'm reluctant to predict any turnaround until I actually see it. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then one final question on RS&I, just to cover all the bases. In the mix of software versus hardware, are you seeing a shift where you've got this great penetration of diagnostics in your selling software upgrades and that's increasing as a percentage of the mix or is that business kind of stable? It would seem like the software margin should be pretty good. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Software margins are pretty good, but I'd say in the quarter, it was relatively stable. From time to time, we can see a bump from software based on, we'll issue 18.4 (54:38), will come out in a quarter and that will bump the software sales. But generally, I would say our software sales go up with the general push of diagnostics. Remember, we tend \u2013 when we're looking at RS&I, we're looking at the sales we show you have quite a bit of software in it in Mitchell 1. Mitchell 1 is a pure software business. Repair shop information and repair shop management, that's where that SureTrack business is. Generally though I don't think we've seen a big change in the mix yet. It might be entitled to the idea that going out future as we get more installed base, you may see some improvement in that. I tend to think as we get more installed base, we'll see both because people will buy in first. The entry-level technician will buy in at the bottom level for that ETHOS. And then when he starts to get more experience, who want to trade up and buy both software and hardware as he trades up. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. So the penetration rate of hardware is still growing. It's not just... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: No, we don't. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : You don't have a cycle where you get to sell a lot of \u2013 a very high-margin software to a large installed base of hardware? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: No, we eventually will. I mean, but I think now, we're still seeing a growing of the penetration. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. All right. Thank you. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. Operator : We'll go next to David Leiker at Baird. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Hi. Joe. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Hi, Joe. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I just want to circle back on your C&I comments. I think it was last year in Q3, when military took its first step down and then energy followed in Q4. So when you look at spending levels in those two businesses as we head into this year's Q3, do you think you could actually get to the point where the comparisons flip around and C&I reports a positive comp in Q3? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, as I said, I think the comps get easier. Clearly, the military comp gets easier, the international aviation comp gets easier, the oil and gas comp kind of is starting to get easier now. So I think those get better. Whether I can predict the turnaround in the military business, the oil and gas business, or the Middle East loosens up, hard to say. They do loosen up and I think you see favorable comps. I mean, like I said, I am positive about our mechanism there, our proof-of-concept. We keep investing in those businesses. If you look at the C&I SG&A or OI this quarter, you see quite a bit of investment, that's because we invested in Asia, we kept investing in these markets because we believe in them. So we obviously believe a turnaround, whether that's a third quarter or not is another question, but these comparisons do get softer. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Great. And then shifting back to the Tools Group, not to belabor this question, but growth slowed more than two points sequentially and your comparisons versus a year-ago got easier. So by saying that hand tools were good in the quarter and big ticket items were strong in the quarter, there just seems to be a missing link in the equation that would explain why growth ultimately did decelerate? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, as I said, I don't really want to go through all the items, but the power tools is down and so on. I don't necessarily recognize that the comparison was necessarily soft versus last year. I'm not really sure about that. But the thing is, is that, from our view, we're not seeing \u2013 all I can say is, we're not seeing anything in the market that's a difference. And so the 5.8%, yeah, it's down from the 8.1%, but we still see it as a pretty strong quarter and we don't have any other view of the future of the Tools Group or the auto repair market based on that. In terms of how the numbers, how the numbers work out, like I said, big ticket, still strong, sold better than the average, hand tools are sold better than the average. The other ones were \u2013 obviously if you talk about arithmetic, they were lower than the average. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Fair enough. My last question, with Fortive being its own company, Matco has been a little more visible and it looks that their van count has grown pretty dramatically in recent years, but it doesn't really seem to be diluting Snap-on's growth at all. And so is it the case where the two of you or really the three of you in this market co-exist? Is there any deterioration or things that you're concerned about, just maybe an update on the competitive dynamics? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, the science of Danaher are strong managers. And so Fortive is a formidable competitor with Matco and so is MAC. But I haven't heard their names mentioned on the last several \u2013 in many, many van rides now. So \u2013 and including the last one, which was just a little while ago. So we don't seem to be seeing them and pinging on them. Whatever they are doing, they are doing it invisible to most of our people. I tend to think people decide to buy Snap-on Tools as they look at others. They make that choice. It's kind of a binary decision. You buy Snap-on because that's the best. If you don't, if you don't, if you don't want that, you look at a bunch of others. Generally if you think about the numbers of people that we have in the field, the 3,487 vans and versus the \u2013 even the advanced Matco numbers, we're \u2013 our people are much more focused and spend more time with the certain amount of customers and calling those customer bases. The Matco and MAC guys chew a lot more dirt. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Very good. Thank you. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yes. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Kratcoski, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks everyone for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on snapon.com and as always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We would like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

As usual I'll start with the third quarter highlights providing update on the environment, and speak about some of our trends. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financial. In the third quarter we again showed progress along our runway for growth and for improvement. And we saw those gains across all our operating segment. Total reported sales were $834.1 million up 1.5% and that included $9.7 million of unfavorable currency. It also included the incremental $1.1 million of sales from last year's acquisition of Ecotechnics. Organic sales were up 2.6% and the OpCo operating margin it was up 140 basis points reaching 18.9%. When you add in the $50.6 million of operating earnings and financial services and that was up from $43.5 million in 2015 but consolidated operating margin was 23%, an increase of 180 basis points. Our EPS was $2.22, up $0.24 a double digit increase, rising 12.1% from last year. Let's consider the environment. Automotive repair continues to be favorable and we believe our Tools Group and our Repairs Systems and Information or RS&I Group, they're both well positioned to take full advantage of that opportunity. The Tools Group clearly demonstrated enhancements to the franchise network, gains in both the North America and European markets continuing to make the most of the opportunities so abundant in an aging and changing vehicle fleet. At RS&I serving repair shop owners and managers, sales progress was mix. The volume of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop was up mid single-digit. For the OEM side, activity with individual dealers was up, while programs commissioned by the OEM manufacturers, a historically lumpy space was down. Under car equipment was flat with variations from product line to product line. For Commercial and Industrial or C&I the group was up organically 1.5%. Snap-on Europe, SNA Europe was higher again making progress against the turbulence of Brexit and the other uncertainties across its market. The industrial business was flat reflecting the challenges we\u2019ve seen now for a year. Significantly however the critical industry activity recorded the second straight quarter of sequential growth following more than year of decrease, reductions driven by the difficult macro environment in areas like oil and gas, military and the Middle East. Now there will always be headwinds across our operations. They\u2019ve been a factor in other quarters and they were present in the third quarter but we did overcome, we did see it growing because we\u2019re well positioned to confront the challenges and continue to proceed down our runways for growth, enhancing the franchise network, expanding with repairs shop owners and managers, expanding to critical industries and building in emerging markets. These do represent our growth strategy and we continue to make progress along those quarter. At the same time, those growth drivers are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, rapid continuous improvement or as we call it RCI. Together these are the processes, the tools we use each and every day to drive improvement and improvement is written all over our results especially customer connection, understanding the works of professional technician and innovation matching that insight with technology to make work easier. Snap-on value creation once again led to more prestigious awards. We were recently honored with two MOTOR magazine top 20 and with five professional tool and equipment news or P10 innovation award. Those winners represent only a fraction of a wide array of new products born out of insight, of the insight of our franchises and our direct sales people, transplanting workplace observations into productivity solution and in the quarter those customer connections were a big factor in our results. To see some of that let's move to the individual groups. Commercial and Industrial, organic sales is up with an operating margin reaching 15.1%, an increase of 80 basis points from last year\u2019s 14.3%, the benefit of Snap-on value creation evident in the ongoing stream of innovative new products developed for the critical industry. One of those products launched in the third quarter by our Industrial division is the PWZ five pliers wrench. This wrench is the latest and the largest model in a popular Snap-on PWZ series. It\u2019s a long 41.34 in inches. It can handle jobs that would traditionally require a pipe wrench with much less slippage for better overall performance and for better safety. It features inwardly angled teeth, fine at the back, large at the front for stronger and more secured grip on objects of all sizes and the narrow jaw design gives improved accessibility in tight compartments and in those cramped corners. It\u2019s perfect for applications on tie rods and other areas that are hard to reach in industries like railroad, oil and gas, for serving fleet, actually any heavy duty application. You heard me speak about in the past about our growing industrial product line. Well this wrench is another great ignition to our handful line up for critical industries. Now SNA Europe, 12 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth navigating some difficult geographies and some taped economies. SNA sales activity continues to be positive but its profits are even more encouraging now up for 14 straight quarters and we believe there is still more opportunity. And the Asia Pacific operation mixed environment across the region, we continue to invest in building our physicals and the Asia operation has gains contributing to the progress in the quarter. So that's C&I. Now on to the tools. Organic sale is up 5.6% significant growth both in the U.S. and international and the internationally. Operating income of $64.6 million compared to $56.3 million in 2015, the operating income margin of 16.3% rose 150 basis points from last year\u2019s 14.8%. Volume gains as well as operating improvement from RCI translated into a significant margin rise and that 150 basis point gain it over attained 60 basis point of negative currency. When you consider the Tools Groups\u2019 success you can see the power of Snap-on value creation of customer connection and innovation. The MOTOR Top 20 and the P10 award represent just a few examples of the recognition our products continue to receive. Awards from industry publications but also awards from the professionals that use our tools every day. Innovation is consistently innovation, it\u2019s consistently been a key contributor to our Tools Group and in the third quarter more new products. Like our reversible ratcheting combination wrench, the latest in the line of a Snap-on wrench of adding a reversible feature to our patented ratcheting mechanism utilizing our dual 80 technology combining dual pulls with thin walls, box end designs, smooth operation, more torque transferring tight basis and a port it incorporates the iconic Snap-on plank drive profile biting into fasteners without rounding corners preventing slippage. The new reversible ratcheting combo wrench it\u2019s more turning power, enhanced durability, compact design and built stronger to last longer. This is the core of Snap-on value creation. Customer connection and innovation solving specific problems in the shop. Take the new 20 millimeter 12-point impact socket born from hours of observations in the workplace, hours of observation at workplace. This socket is designed to remove head bolts in large industrial engines, long enough to reach the deepest of inaccessible and strong enough to remove the toughest fasteners a unique combination. It\u2019s produced in our Elkmont, Alabama plant and it\u2019s essential for servicing large off road equipment. It may not be needed often but when it is it\u2019s critical and Snap-on has it. It\u2019s just another example of our commitment to make work easier solving our technician\u2019s most challenging problem. In the third quarter it\u2019s also when hold the annual Snap-on franchisee conference or SFC. This year it was in Orlando with more than 8,700 attendees franchisee and family members from over 3,000 routes, three days of showcasing the opportunities, the opportunities to enhance the franchise channel and I can report to you because I was there that based on the optimism and the confidence of our franchisees it was big success in orders because we orders at these events and orders while they were up once again beating the record levels of 2015. Now when we speak of the wrench, we also have to consider the strategic combination of Snap-on credit. Our financial services are on help to create opportunities across the organization but especially within the Tools Group it\u2019s been an ongoing partnership for over 50 years and our credit company had a strong presence at this year\u2019s SFC supporting franchisees with unique program. 270,000 of our approximately 875,000 about 30% of our technician customers in the United States have credit company contract enabling those big ticket item. The credit company has been a key part of franchisee success and the third quarter was no exception to that. Now let\u2019s move to RS&I. Organic sales were up 1.7%. The operating market of 25.1%, it increased 50 basis points from the 24.6% registered last year. As I mentioned RS&S clearly show progress in providing repair information and diagnostics to independent show owners and managers. And certainly a portion of that growth came from innovative new product several launch at the SFC. Product like the MODIS Edge, our latest diagnostic offering an enhanced industrial design, improved ergonomics, reduced weight and Code Scan capability that allows the Tech to scan all of the vehicles computer system with the systems with the push of a single button. It also contains fast excess oil change and recent information, automatic vehicle identification and are unique SureTrack expert database. All features specifically designed to save the technician significant time. This new handheld is lighter, faster and smarter and simply based on the excited crowds of franchises at the SFC that carved out precious time to a 10 MODIS Edge handheld training. We expect this to be a very popular item. Another exciting SFC launch was our Diagnostic Thermal Imager, this completely new Snap-on offering a breakthrough and pinpointing drop with a graphical display illustrating surface data, temperature data and a referenced library of nominal and respect thermal images for a variety of auto parts found in break, emission system and in vehicle electrical equipment. We believe we have a winner with the Diagnostic Thermal Imager and autos at the SFC prove it, its sold out. And RCI innovation wasn\u2019t just an diagnostic product. Take the brand new polytech air conditioning unit from our recent acquisition eco technique. Develop and manufacture specifically for the North American market meeting a very aggressive launch both our US and our Canadian customers have a firm strength of the units designed performance. Its been our real testament to the capability of the eco techniques team. And speaking of products, I\u2019m getting more to sell to repair shop owners and managers. This week we entered into a definite agreement to acquire Car-O-Liner based in Gothenburg, Sweden, but reaching around the globe. Car-O-Liner product offering in its special expertise are important editions to the Snap-on team providing extraordinary capabilities in collision repairs at segment were changed now authoring opportunity. It\u2019s an operation that strengthens our position both in auto and in the heavy duty. Car-O-Liner is another coherent business and we believe that match with Snap-on team, it offers substantial possibilities for both growth and for improvement, all of that. Great opportunity going forward. So that\u2019s the highlights of our quarter. Organic sales, up 2.6% gains across all group progress along our runways for growth. Snap-on value creation trying our customer connection insights into innovative new products and along with our ongoing RCI initiatives driving margin improvement and it all shows in a result. Optical OI margin arising to 18.9%, up a 140 basis points. EPS of $2.22, up 12.1%. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our third quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $834.1 million were up $12.6 million or 1.5%. Due to the strengthening of the US dollar or currency moment adversely impacted our Q3 sales comparisons by 120 basis points excluding $9.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition related sales. Organic sales increased 2.6% reflecting pretty good progress and serving the vehicle repair sector as well as well as improvements in sales in our commercial and industrial segment. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% grew 70 basis points from 2015 leveled, primarily due to benefits from higher sales in savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $261.5 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.3% in the quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and lower pension expense. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of a $157.6 million including $4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 9.7% and as a percentage of sales improved 140 basis points to 18.9%. Financial services revenue of $71.6 million in the quarter increased 17.2% from 2015 level. And operating earnings of $50.6 million increased 16.3%. Consolidated operating earnings of $208.2 million including $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 11.3% and the operating margin of 23% improved 180 basis points from 21.2% a year ago. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 31.2% compared to 31.6% last year. For the full year we now anticipate that our 2016 effective income tax rate will be slightly below our full-year 2015 rate of 31.7%. Finally, net earnings of $131.7 million or $2.22 per diluted share increased $14.9 million or $0.24 per share for 2015 levels, representing a 12.1% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with commercial and industrial, our C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $289.3 million in the third quarter increased modestly over 2015 levels excluding $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased 1.5%, primarily due to a mid-single-digit increase in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a low single-digit increase in both the segment's power tools and Asia Pacific operations. Organic sales to customers in critical industries were essentially flat and the decline to the aerospace market segment was largely offset by gain in sales to the military and increases in both the technical education and natural resources market segments. Despite the continued presence of certain headwinds in the industrial space, we were encouraged that sales performance has improved what we had seen earlier in the year. Gross profit of the C&I Group of $112.7 million compared $109.5 million last year. The gross margin of 39% improved to 110 basis points primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives and 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effect. Operating expenses of $69 million in the quarter compared to $68.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.9% increased to 30 basis points, primarily as a result of higher cost including cost associated with continued expansion initiatives in Asia and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $43.7 million including 0.3 million of favorable foreign currency effects increased $2.4 million of 2015 levels and the operating margin of 15.1% improved 80 basis points from 14.3% last year, representing a recent high for C&I and up a 130 basis points sequentially. Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $397.2 million increased 4.4%. Excluding $4.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, organic sales increased $21.2 million or 5.6% reflecting mid-single-digit gains in both the company\u2019s US and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $173.3 million compared to $166.5 last year. Gross margin of 43.6% declined 20 basis points as benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives were more than offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effect. Operating expenses of $108.7 million in the quarter compared $110.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 27.3% improved to 170 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI and other cost reduction initiatives. As a result of these factor, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $64.6 million including $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 16.3% improved 150 basis points from 14.8% last year. Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9, third quarter sale of $286.1 million increased 1.1% from 2015 level excluding $2.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $1.1 million of acquisition related sales, organic sales increased 1.7%. The organic sales increase primarily reflects a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. In the quarter, sales of both undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships were essentially flat. As Nick mentioned, sales to OEM dealerships this quarter were practically impacted by the timing of essential tool of facilitation program sale. For example, sales in Q3 of last year benefited from a refrigeration related facility action program which has since lapsed. Gross profit of $133.1 million compared to $130.9 last year and a gross margin of 46.5% improved 20 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives partially offset by 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $61.3 million in the quarter compared to $61.2 million last year. The operating expense margin of 21.4% grew 30 basis point principally due to savings from RCI initiatives. Third quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $71.8 million including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $2.1 million from prior level and the operating margin of 25.1% improved 50 basis points from 24.6% last. As we announced earlier this week and as Nick mentioned in his remarks, we have entered into an definitive agreement to purchase Car-O-Liner. Car-O-Liner annual sales are approximately $95 million and we expect them to generate operating income margin somewhat similar to those of RS&I undercar equipment business which are typically in the low teens. We expect to complete the acquisition of Car-O-Liner within the next month. Our plan is to fund the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and approximately $125 million in issuances of commercial paper. Now, turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $50.6 million on revenue of $71.6 million compared to operating earnings of $43.5 million on revenue of $61.1 million last. Financial services expenses in the quarter included some additional headcount related expenses to help better serve our growing portfolio. But, as a percentage of the average portfolio financial services expenses were 1.2% in both periods. The average yield on financial receivables of 18% in the quarter compared to 17.9% last year and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.4% compared to 9.5% last year. Originations of $269.8 million in the quarter increased 4.7% prior year level. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $1.8 billion of gross financing receivables including $1.6 million from our US operation. Approximately 81% of our US financing portfolio relates to expanded credit loans to technicians. The first nine months of 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $190.3 million. As per finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continue to be in line with our expectation. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $111.9 million in the quarter decreased $1.8 million from comparable 2015 level. Its higher net earnings were more than offset by $11.4 million of higher cash tax maintenance and $5.4 million of higher US pension contributions. Net cash used by investing activities of $69.2 million included $56 million fund, a net increase in finance receivables and $16.5 million of capital expenditures. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $26.6 million in 2015 year-end levels reflecting both higher sales in an increase in days sales outstanding from 60 days year-end to 63 days at third quarter end. Inventories increased $25.8 million in 2015 year-end levels, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. On a trailing 12 months basis, inventory turns of 3.3 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end. Our quarter end cash position of $117.5 million increased $24.7 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net increase includes $501.7 million of cash collections of finance receivables and $415.6 million of cash from operations. These cash increases were largely offset by the funding of $691.4 million of finance receivables, dividend payment of $106.3 million, the repurchase of 492,000 shares for $76.4 million and $56.6 million for capital expenditures. Our net debt to capital ratio 22.6% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. In addition to our $117 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of third quarter end, we had $8 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. And I'll now turn the call back over to Nick. Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks Aldo. Stepping back and looking at the Snap-on third quarter; we believe a number of things are apparent. Our part of the auto repair market is solid. As we've seen in the past that followed the different trajectory that new car sale. It was reliable even in the withering discussion of 2009 and strong today. And we believe our ability to take advantage of that opportunity grows every quarter and you can see it in a result.  Tools Group, sales up 5.6% organically. The franchises were prosperous and stronger. The group's OI margin up 150 basis points against 60 basis points of unfavorable currency. The credit company continue to serve as the Tools Group's strategic partner and enabling franchises and technicians as it has done for five decades to recession after recession without disruption.  RS&I selling to repair shop owners and managers mixed growth in uncovering the usual ups and downs of OEM sponsored programs, but showing real progress with individual shot, both independent and dealers. And C&I a mixed turbulence but now growing again, showing year over year and sequential gains despite the difficult macros and despite the difficult macros registering operating margin of 15.1% up 80 basis points. Showing what we believe is confirmation of the great value it offers as run rate of coherent growth. And finally in the result you can see the effects of Snap-on value creation more new product driving gains and the engine of rapid continues improvement offering efficiency, it all came together for organic sales growth of 2.6% and an optical operating margin of 18.9%, up 140 basis point and an EPS of $2.22 and increase of 12.1% a double digit gain again. And the Car-O-Liner acquisition giving us more to sale, more opportunities for coherent growth and providing more possibilities for the Snap-on value creation to drive progress. The great opportunity. It was an encouraging quarter and we believe it clearly confirms the future of continuous Snap-on growth and improvement as we move through the end of this year and into 2017 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator for questions, I'll keep directly to our franchises and associates. I know that many of you are listening or will listen to this call. Once again you should know that the encouraging performance of our corporation is only possible because of your capability, your energy and your dedication. For your extraordinary contribution to our progress you have my congratulations and for your unfailing commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Leiker with Baird. Joe Vruwink : Hi, good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David. I wanted to discuss the deceleration in origination growth this quarter. So maybe for context, can you revisit the driver of the double-digit origination growth, that has been seen in recent quarters? And then maybe comment on whether demand conditions or other items change for those same drivers, or those same products in the current quarter? Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Look, a couple of things, first of all big ticket the idea of Snap-on tool storage and diagnostic were strong in a quarter, in fact stronger than - so much stronger than the overall Snap-on tools growth and incidentally this is side hand tools were also pretty strong in the quarter. So it was still a good quarter for big ticket items, which are the principle driver for these things. Secondly and the reason that is the case. Reason why big ticket has been the case it's because we've been investing in product, great new tool storage products and number of used features and number of great attractive product that get customers excited. The fact that diagnostics are more important in the repair shop than ever before and technicians are trying to - I guess caliber off to have better and bigger diagnostic take care of those products. It's natural that big ticket items would be stronger, so you would see that. So I think that looking at the Tools Group and seeing that lead the way is just a consequence of our investment in the marketplace and as the kinds of product we've had and the demand to the market associated - the shift in the market associated with more diagnostic. And also our investment in enabling event that breakthrough the original structural barriers of the bands that is the space and time the Rock n Roll CADs which we talked about quite a bit which helped tool storage and the Techno band we have 67 of them now. In a Techno band we have 49 of them and that drive fairly robust bigger ticket items sale. In terms of higher-double digit before - double digit origination before and somewhat less originations now, you can't trade quarter-to-quarter, because there isn\u2019t a perfect one-to-one correlation. Remember that when you are looking at originations you are looking at franchisee sales. When you are looking at the Tools Group you are looking at our sales. We sell for the franchisees but the timing is different then you have on top of that the franchise margin and then we have on top of that the idea that a tool storage sale or diagnostic sale may ignite the couple of trading type sales which would also be somewhat supported by the credit card. So, you put those all together and that shows the landscape, but when we step back and we look at the say, 2015 numbers, when we look at the 2015 numbers about origination and the Tools Group big ticket sale, they seem pretty much the same. And this year we start to see year to date the same kind of thing. Joe Vruwink : So I'm sure you know, in the market, there seems to be this idea that tools group growth is only strong because origination growth is strong. This quarter, you actually maintained a strong rate of growth, organic growth, stable quarter over quarter, originations came down. That either to me seems like the hand tool category may be strengthened quarter over quarter, or this whole relationship of painting tools group as a byproduct of the credit business maybe isn't the most accurate relationship. Nicholas Pinchuk : This is the most accurate. The tools group is a strategic partner- I mean the credit company is the strategic partner of the Tools Group. But if you think about it, yes, okay, but only 270,000 of our 875,000 customers, they have a credit company contract that's only about 30%. So if you think as a Tools Group growth been driven exclusively by the credit company mojo, think again. It just isn\u2019t that wide, of course, it is grown because the market has - the customers have turned that way and we have invested into support that with new product and also part of the way we figured out how to enable the band has been associated with that segment. But it's a natural thing, I've been talking about the Rock n Roll CADs for multiple quarters and that would naturally of course drive a little bit more credit company activity. Okay? Joe Vruwink : And then my last question if I can, the comps are difficult, so to do the growth you did this quarter was positive. I'm just thinking, you took 3,000 routes down intra-quarter for the franchisee conference. Is there any indication based on vans coming back online, and your order activity, that\u2019s the pace of sales you got strength in year-over-year in the Q4? Nicholas Pinchuk : I am not in the business of projecting out. I'll only say this is what I said on the call, look. The Franchisee Conference was baffled. It was really good and the enthusiasm was good, so I can tell it anecdotally or anybody was there was talking anecdotally I'm just with the national franchises, the National Franchise Advisory report and they are all positive. And quantitative piece is the orders were up, it was up over the record that we set last year at the SFC. Now they don\u2019t translate one to one in sale, they were up significantly. It doesn\u2019t translate one to one, but what it says is our guys saw the new product they were confident in the future they invested and they ordered so they think good things are coming. Joe Vruwink : Great, thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning Nick, good morning Aldo. Aldo, in your prepared statement, maybe you can answer, you talked about the physicals, the investment in emerging markets of C&I. Are you seeing any kind of significant revenue growth there to begin absorbing that upfront investment? Aldo Pagliari : The emerging markets tend to have their own volatility and lumpiness so to speak for lack of a better word but we believe that the secret to penetrating the emerging markets is to establish physical presence, people, place, products that suite those market and those environments. So through thick and thin we\u2019re continuously looking for opportunities to expand our footprint because we know that what we\u2019ve today could still be improved upon. So that\u2019s basically our philosophy when it comes to that Liam. Nicholas Pinchuk : We\u2019re investing in things like more Blue-Point stores, more products. You are trying to expand your product line and more sales outlets. For example we just opened another sales outlet in Vietnam this quarter. So that\u2019s the kind of investment we\u2019re doing because in the 11 years I lived in Asia I know I am confident that the building of the physical allows you to take advantage of the market as it matures. Liam Burke : And, same with C&I, on the new product introductions, you talked about that being a big driver of incremental growth. Are there any particular verticals that you, this quarter, saw opportunity to put new product into the market? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, we had - we talked about couple of those. I mean I think in this particular market the natural resources we\u2019ve been - I can only say that actually we\u2019re trying to play the long game in C&I. We believe we\u2019re trying to build our activity in each of these markets. So for example, not in this particular quarter because we wouldn\u2019t make product adjustment for a quarter. We see opportunities, we build out \u2013 our goal was to build up in each of the markets. For example last year we brought out 929 new products just for aviation, 313 for oil and gas even though it was, we\u2019re having probably one of the most difficult times, 313 for military even though it was a difficult time. So we just keep addition not so much targeting. Now we still have some great opportunities they are still on heavy duty, the substitute for the pipe wrench, that\u2019s been a great new product. And so we see things like that all the time. We see enhancements to our visual control system, our tool control system which we\u2019ve seen now. Amazingly we\u2019ve seen the tool control system more and go bleed into oil and gas. We have a major sale in Canada associated with oil and gas as opposed when we had been using it just for aviation. We can see it rolling into railroad with small enhancements. That\u2019s the kind of thing we\u2019re doing. Liam Burke : Great. Thanks Nick, thanks Aldo. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Good morning everyone. Congratulations Nick, on a good quarter. The question is on the tools group and your margin is up 150 basis points, including 60 BPs of negative FX. You have come through a period where you have a period of hypergrowth, as that term might be applied to this particular category. That growth seems to be slowing now. Obviously, there is a lot of cost opportunity that is out of reach when you're getting that kind of growth, but now the growth is easing a little bit. Maybe that cost opportunity becomes more accessible. The question is how sustainable are these year-over-year margin progression numbers, given that you now have a cost of opportunity you might not have had for the last couple of years? Aldo Pagliari : I think there is some truth in what you say there, I don\u2019t think you can predict quarter by quarter in this kind of situation. Of course one is with your eyeballs are looking for trying to double-digit growth that kind of things you maybe perhaps have some efficiency opportunities but we like to believe we take full advantage of those kind of things. I think though if you look at our overall number, if you look at the OI margin growth for the corporation and you take a look at the year-over-year OpCo margin and you go back and see it, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s been triple-digits on awful lot of times awfully far back in peak sales growth and small sales growth. So I think we\u2019ve been able to grow that margin in a lot of different situations on an overall basis. Now in the situation at Tools Groups it does give you a little more advantage, little opportunity to look at that but I wouldn\u2019t allow the characterization that 5.6% is low. I think that\u2019s pretty good growth. I mean we\u2019re taking about 5.6% organically in GDP that are throwing between 1 and 2 all over the world. So I think it\u2019s pretty good. David MacGregor : If I could just follow-up with a couple of other quick ones. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. David MacGregor : The slower growth in the origination, how much of that was just the flat under car? Nicholas Pinchuk : Say that again please. David MacGregor : The slower growth in originations I am just wondering how much of that might have been due to lack of growth in under car. Nicholas Pinchuk : No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that much. I mean the thing is that of course there some under car equipment that gets sold in to the Tools Group space but just primarily when you\u2019re talking about the origination, the primary driver is tool storage and the second driver is the big ticket diagnostics. So it\u2019s not real. There is some of it in there floating around but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s much of a factor. David MacGregor : Okay, last question, I know you are going to market through your franchisees but you have a pretty substantial distribution arrangement as well. Was de-stocking within your distribution partners \u2013 how much of a growth inhibitor was that in the quarter? Nicholas Pinchuk : I am sure there was some of it but I\u2019d have to say it might have been, it would have shown up in the industrial business that was flat like I said it was up sequentially which gave us some positives. I don\u2019t think it was huge factor this quarter, it might been some evolving. David MacGregor : Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research. Tom Hayes : Good morning gentlemen. On the RS&I group, Nick, your organic growth rates have been bouncing around the last couple of quarters. I wanted a little bit of clarity digging into that a bit. Maybe the route trajectory of the diagnostic equipment, versus the undercar that is in there as well. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, look, like we said in the I think the statements, the formal statements is that diagnostic information and products and diagnostics so that will be like Mitchell and diagnostics the software and the handheld hardware to independent repair shop owners and managers were up mid single-digit and it\u2019s been up. That kind of number gee I think every quarter for a long time. I can attest to it exactly but I think that in most quarters it\u2019s has been bouncing around mid to high single-digit. Tom Hayes : Okay. Nicholas Pinchuk : So I think that\u2019s doing pretty well. The big thing about diagnostics at this time I mean, not diagnostics but RS&I this time as I tried to make clear in the quarter we have this business in RS&I which produces, which takes contracts, OEM commission contract to distribute where you could talk potential tools or facilitate a project. So for example you might have somebody\u2019s Aldo referred to this to do some air-conditioning, provide an air-conditioning reclaim system for all its dealers. One of the manufacturers is like, I want you to provide this air-conditioning system, I want you to get it my dealers, I want it to be two per dealer and I want it to be rolled out in the next four quarters or three quarters. We rolled it out. That\u2019s a pretty big piece of sales. You might have another one that does an essential tool for a particular new product or a new technology that rolls out on an new truck that rolls to in a quarter but what happens is these are driven by the view of the OEM and the technology and the differences that are rolling through their new models. So they tend to be quite lumpy and what happened in this quarter for that particular type of business this was kind of a strong quarter in that business and that created the overhang, one of the overhangs in RS&I. Tom Hayes : Okay, and then on the\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : But the stuff we sell to individual dealers was pretty good. Tom Hayes : On the Car-O-Liner acquisition, that was roughly $95 million in revenue. Is that a little bit of geographic clarity, is that all Europe, or is that spread across? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, no. It\u2019s like about, it\u2019s like this. It\u2019s about 45% U.S. about 30% in Europe and the rest in the rest of the world but there is a big piece of that like 20 points or 25 points in Asia. That\u2019s the way it works. And the 275 people, 100 in the factories, 150 selling, 50 engineers and the rest to do in other thing. Tom Hayes : Okay. Lastly if I could for Aldo. Fourth quarter last year on the operating expenses it took a pretty big step down versus 3Q of \u201915. Is there anything in there that maybe you guys held back last year that we need to think about this year? Aldo Pagliari : No I mean the top of mind you can think about the creates little bit of volatility if there is a changes in mark to market, it's depending on stock price one way or the other. Tom Hayes : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. David Kelley : Good morning. This is David Kelley in for Bret. Just a quick follow-up on RS&I, and specifically the undercar business being flat. We have heard similar commentary from other aftermarket retailers and installers, and they mostly have been referencing the residual impact from last year's mild winter weather. Just thinking about some of the industry fundamentals and miles driven being up, it feels like it's a bit surprising that segment is still lagging. The question is, do you think there is some pent-up demand there, or some real opportunity for you as we lap last winter, and slowly inch to 2017? Nicholas Pinchuk : I don\u2019t know. For us the winter thing is a double-edge sword. I heard people say winter is tough and therefore we don\u2019t sale balances or we don\u2019t sale -- we don\u2019t do tire service, we'll service when winter is mild. So we don\u2019t do as much tire service. On the other hand I heard people say, yes, people are crashing into each other left and side there is lot of repair, we need more or less, we need more alignment going on. People are running into bumpers or bouncing into potholes. So it's a double-edge sword. I am not so sure, but I do think there is opportunity in our business. What we saw there was variation from product to product. We saw kind of stronger quarter and alignment and couple of the other product lines that are little bit weaker. We didn\u2019t really think it was very significant or indicative of anything actually for us. We do think there is opportunity for the equipment business going forward though because we like our product. David Kelley : Okay, great. So you don\u2019t see any real structural issue that for whatever reason undercars?. Nicholas Pinchuk : I don\u2019t think so. We don\u2019t see it anyway and we are in garage with every -- we have people in garage for hours every week. David Kelley : Sure, sure. And a follow-up on the strong tools organic growth, I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the drivers there, the specific product segments that are just really outperforming as of late? Or even regional trends, are you seeing some specific region or part of the U.S.? Nicholas Pinchuk : There can be regional trends, but they tend to very quarter to quarter, they tell you the truth. The thing is I can tell you I was just with a bunch of franchises, and from all over the country this is the National Franchise Advisory conference, they all seemed positive. And they are representing the region. So I didn\u2019t run into a single person who was saying, this is tough. And we are saying that they were positive. At the SFC I can't emphasize enough, how important is it when people order more year-over-year. What is means is they are putting their money on the line, they are committing to taking products that they think things are going to positive, so they got a positive outlook. So we feel good about that. What's driving our business I think maybe three factors. One is our new products pretty robust. You heard me talk about couple of them for handtools. Handtools were up in the quarter, tool storage were up in the quarter, diagnostic were up in the quarter. We talk about that product line because I think about customer innovation is better than ever before. We have more products than we ever had. Secondly, our franchises are stronger. They are stronger and the despite the fact they are stronger they seem to be hungrier for more products. And thirdly, we've invested in things in the vans like Rock N' Roll Cabs. The Techno-Vans and our franchises are so confident that taking on system, so the model itself is getting better that another way it's a great market. Auto repair is a great market and like I said every quarter we know how to take better advantage to the opportunity. You can see it. David Kelley : Okay, great, thanks. One more for me, and thanks again for taking my questions, I will pass it along. You referenced the jump into the US collision market with the deal. How do we think about US collision here? My understanding is you didn't have a ton of exposure to that market, and I know the US collision sector from talking to the LKQs and Coparts of the world, has certainly been strong, and feels like it is going to be strong for the next few years. What do you think you opportunity is in U.S. collision? Nicholas Pinchuk : We like it for a few reason, one is we believe car liner is a great brand, but we smear the Snap-on over it even stronger. Secondly, this is a space which is changing, different materials are requiring different modes of collision repair. And car liner's the out front on that regards with their product line and our research and engineering can augment those 50 or 45 engineers at car liners to make them better. Thirdly, we think that repair start to become more important in collision shops because there is intelligent distributor around the car. You get a dent you got repair things and so we can bring the repair aspect the collision shops something no one else can do in this space. Our products in terms of our physical products and data base associated with repair. So we think it\u2019s a great coherent acquisition. David Kelley : All right great. I appreciate the color. Thanks again. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Stember from C.L. King. Scott Stember : Good morning. Can you maybe talk about Brexit, your initial observations, whether you have seen any impact on the UK market? And either from a sales or a currency perspective? And then, maybe just to talk about your expectations for currency. It looks like we still have some headwinds. I know initially before Brexit there was a thought that later in this year, that the comparisons would start to flatten out. Can you maybe talk about those two things? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, look Brexit of course as I referred is a challenge for as part of the turbulence in Europe. But in fact if you look at the three pieces of our businesses in Europe, if you look at the Tools Group up strong in the U.K., you look at RS&I up nicely but you look at SNA Europe and SNA Europe was up in the quarter again I think it was the 12 straight quarter of growth. That was down slightly. So Brexit might have hurt them a little bit, it really would but generally overall volume it was great market for Snap-on. U.K. was one of our better market. The problem is in the currency so it becomes a big liner in terms of - it becomes a big effect in terms of sales, translation effect on our sales because we have pretty good sales in pounds and secondly remember we\u2019re selling into the British market, selling in pound but we\u2019re making in dollars, we\u2019re making in United States. So we have a transitional impact. So if you step back and you look at our currency overall for the corporation that $2.22 it has $0.05 of currency impact and a lot of that was the U.K., a lot of that was the UK. Of course there were some other factors in there. And then looking forward when you start at look at the UK kind of went down in the quarter so we think kind of like from a sales perspective looking forward we probably don\u2019t see as much pressure from translation but the profitability will be about the same maybe a little bit more impacted going forward because of the pound. Now going out beyond where are now. That\u2019s based on where we sit today in terms of the pound. If the pound gets weaker it will impact us more. But that\u2019s the major factor. We think our product and our improved capabilities overwhelm the sales factor, the selling factor just the currency sensitive factor. Scott Stember : Got it. And the last question on weather again, taking a different slant, the record warmth that we have had this summer, maybe for air-conditioning related products, have you seen any jump in demand for any tools that are related to any AC repair? Nicholas Pinchuk : I am sure that happened but I can\u2019t you quote you any figures on that, I haven\u2019t sliced the tools by virtually AC repair. That is one of the thing that does happen. Every year there is a new story about that, it\u2019s a hard winter or short winter and people have different tools. The cool thing about Snap-on is, we have the widest product line, so whatever the conditions we have something to sell into those conditions. Scott Stember : Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hi, good morning. A couple of questions. Did you call out what the European hand tools business was up on a percentage basis this quarter, Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : I did not but it\u2019s up mid single - I think maybe mid single-digit. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Aldo Pagliari : Sorry go ahead. Gary Prestopino : No, I was just going to say, that\u2019s about where it\u2019s been all year right. Aldo Pagliari : Yes, it\u2019s been around that level, yes, it\u2019s been growing. I mean, it\u2019s still, I hate to say this but it\u2019s still got headroom. I mean it\u2019s still below where it was at its peak, maybe 15% or so below where it was but we think it\u2019s got headroom and the profitability 14 up straight quarters. We know that has a runway. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Aldo Pagliari : That\u2019s a good thing for us. Gary Prestopino : Right, okay, so good things for it. And then, could you give us some idea of what Car-O-Liner's growth has been historically, and where you think you can take that? Top line growth? Nicholas Pinchuk : I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking backwards in terms of growth. We like to look forward and we see this as a kind of in the 5 plus vicinity, RS&I type. When you think of the RS&I type business growth that\u2019s where we see it, the 5 plus type business. I think it\u2019s a kind of a food errand to be true definitive looking forward but I can tell you that we think looking at it that\u2019s a solid projection. Gary Prestopino : Okay. That is good. And then in terms of, it looks like year-to-date the corporate expenses are down about $13 million. Your SG&A is down as well. Is that all dealing with the pension expense on the market to market on the stocks? Aldo Pagliari : It is Gary, the pension this year the way the accounting rules work we have a savings per quarter of about $1.9 million so you can multiply that by 3 and you get a year-to-date amount. And then the noise is created by how the stock price moves not just this year but remember you have to look at the movement relative to last year. For this particular quarter there is really no change of mark-to-market it\u2019s very benign. So most of the changes in corporate expenses this quarter is related solely to pension expense. Nicholas Pinchuk : How we look at it the quarter is down I think year-over-year like 1.2 million something like that, 22.5 versus 22.7 but the penalty for currency was well more than offsetting that. That's good news out of pension. So we think we ended up on the short end of that combination. Gary Prestopino : Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our last question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Richard Hilgert : Thanks for taking my question. Good morning everybody. All of my questions have already been asked, congratulations on a great quarter, good to see the continued improvement and the profitability across the group still, and still seeing that nice growth in the financial services area. And, appreciated that little bit of color earlier on the differentiation between what is going on in hand tools, and the growth in financial services. Just a final question remaining for me was, I noticed that on a percentage basis, if you take a look at your intersegment number, on the breakdown for revenue with the segments, it has gotten a little bit larger, compared to history. It is running now above 14% number as a percentage of the total, of the segment revenues. And on an absolute basis, now up to $139 million. Just curious what is driving that and should we be expecting that percentage to be a higher amount of the total going forward? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, no kidding, it will grow because of the Tools Group has been growing. If you think about it the Tools Group it\u2019s got its own factory but it\u2019s got that great distribution. So inside C&I there are factories like the power tools factory and so on like other places that sell, they sell externally but they also sell to the Tools Group SNA Europe does that, RS&I has some divisions that do that. We\u2019ve torque wrenches in C&I that do that do that out in California so sell in both places. So as the Tools Group grow, you will see inter-company sales grow, it\u2019s a natural outcome of that. Richard Hilgert : Okay, great. Thanks you very much and again congrats on the quarter. Operator : That concludes today's question and answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back to Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks everyone for joining us today. As usual a replay will be available shortly on snapon.com and as always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.",

I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and of our year and I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the environment and on our progress. After that, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. The Snap-on fourth quarter, sales increases and broad profit gains marking another period of encouraging performance; again this quarter we had opportunities and we had headwinds. We took advantage of those opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Overall sales in the quarter were $889.8 million, 4.5% higher than last year. That total included acquisition related volume from Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont and it also included the impact of $15.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Our organic growth in the quarter was 3.6% with gains registered across every group. EPS, it was $2.47, up 11.3% from the $2.22 registered in 2015. Our OpCo operating margin reached 19.8%, an increase of 70 basis points and those profits include $3.7 million of adverse foreign currency. Financial services earnings of 51.6% (sic) [$51.6 million] (3:27) were also up, leading to a consolidated operating margin including both financial services and OpCo of 23.6%, an improvement of 90 basis points in the quarter. And our markets, well the Automotive Repair segment continues to remain favorable, changing technology, the aging vehicles requiring new tools and more repairs. Our Tools Group \u2013 progress in all geographies, gains throughout the franchise network and the repair systems and information, our RS&I Group, advancements across our businesses serving repair shops, owners and managers. All of them. Taken together these businesses confirm the ongoing strength of the repair market, and clearly demonstrate the opportunity available. Now for our Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I, the markets were mixed but overall positive. There were of course headwinds and some still recovering industrial sectors and a few macro-economically challenged geographies but in total, progress was across that group. U.S. military sales were robust. Budgets restraints loosened, and we are on point to take advantage. And we're ready to act in the future as further opportunities arise in that area. C&I's also the most international of our businesses. And in the period, our overall activity in the regions outside the U.S. increased, overcoming the economic turbulence that exists in Europe, the Middle East, and in some parts of Asia. So across the corporation, I would characterize our environment as mixed but positive, with ongoing strength in automotive repair and some improvement in the afflicted critical industries and the challenged geographies. And we remain confident that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, on the opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding our presence with repair shop owners and managers, extending in critical industries, and building in emerging markets. In looking ahead, we also see clear runways for further improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement in RCI is continuing to drive significant advantages. Our fourth quarter and our full year results clearly confirm that progress. And our new acquisitions, they provide more opportunity to apply those processes and create value. Now for the full year, sales were $3.43 billion, an as reported increase of 2.3%. The organic volume gain was 2.9%, with the Tools Group up 5.6%, RS&I rising 4.7%, and C&I slightly ahead of last year. Our EPS in 2016 was $9.20, an increase of 13.6%. And driving those earnings was an OpCo operating margin of 19.1%, up 140 basis points for the full year. And when we include the income from financial services of $198.7 million, which rose $28.5 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation was 23%, up 170 basis points. Results achieved by taking advantage of the opportunities on our runways for growth, and by driving down our runways for improvement. Now let's move to the groups in our fourth quarter. In C&I, sales increased 1.6% from 2015, impacted by $6.2 million of unfavorable currency and helped by $4.2 million in acquisition related volume. Organic sales were up 2.4%, the second straight quarter of increases for C&I but with varied results across the group including gains by SNA Europe and by industrial, and decreases in the power tools and in places like India and Indonesia. C&I operating income was $43.9 million. That represents an operating margin of 15.3%, a rise of 40 basis points. That's our second quarter of 15%s. Encouragingly SNA Europe again posted increased organic sales, up high single-digits, continuing its progress. Now 13 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth. And the profit climb for SNA Europe was even steeper, now up 15 straight quarters. Snap-on Value Creation at work with innovative new products, and improved new processes creating those extended trends in some what I would call fairly challenging geographies. Also in C&I our Industrial division moved forward. As I mentioned before, on strong U.S. military sales, and also an array of new products. New products like \u2013 innovations like our radiator cap removal for the railroad sector, a specially designed offering used on locomotive or engine radiator caps replacing field cobble sockets, which were prone to early failure. The Snap-on solution incorporates deep machine grooves which provides the ample engagement and the strength necessary to remove what you might imagine are those very stubborn railroad caps. The new adapter can be paired with a standard ratchet, eliminating the need for the previously used long T-handled tool and therefore requiring less clearance to perform the task, making the job easier in those tight engine quarters. Another productivity solution born from a long list of customer connection made every day, this one for the rail industry. And for the Aviation segment, our Industrial division launched the Versatorq 2, torque data acquisition system, designed to verify and record torque ratings in tight and even hazardous environments. Places like aircraft fuel lines, the Versatorq 2 allows easy torque measurement deep inside air frames, where access is difficult and it includes an explosive-proof electronics making it safe, even in combustible environments. This unique Snap-on offering enables the technicians to record critical information, storing and recalling up to 3,500 torque readings. And the product is UL compliant for safety, and ATECH certified for use in potentially explosive atmospheres. And based on that, we believe we have a clear winner in the Versatorq. Our Power Tools division recorded lower sales in the quarter, as I said. That said, it did launch some promising new product. Product like our CTR714, a 14.4 volt quarter-inch drive cordless ratchet. It was launched in December so it didn't drive the quarter, but it has a great future. This latest tool in the Snap-on cordless family includes a tapered head designed for better accessibility, 35 foot pounds of torque output, perfect for applications with fasteners 10 millimeters or smaller that are delicate and difficult, a variable speed trigger for that all important control with those small fasteners, a built-in LED light to illuminate any work area, and new drive materials for increased strength, size, power and durability. Terrific for small fasteners in tight spaces, because of that, because of the size, power and durability and the applicability to tight spaces for small fasteners, we believe we have another best-in-class product with our cordless ratchet. Well, that's C&I. Now on to the Tools Group. A 3% rise in organic sales. Operating earnings of $73.5 million; a margin rate of 17.6%, up 10 basis points, a gain which includes 70 basis points impact from negative currency. So overcoming that fairly significant negative currency hit. Now, the volume growth in the Tools Group was not what we've seen in recent periods. The full year average for the group is 5.6%. But importantly, based on what we see in the shops, and what we hear from our franchisees, we don't believe there's been any significant change in the overall auto repair market. It's still robust, and offers abundant opportunity and we don't believe there's been any change in the positive trajectory of the Tools Group growing strength. We often speak of our Snap-on's runways for coherent growth, strategic avenues of sales opportunities. At the top of the list is enhancing the franchise channel, and we believe we're positioned to continue that positive trajectory. Throughout the year and even in the recent quarter, the Tools Group demonstrated significant progress along that runway, financials trending positively, the franchisee health metrics consistently gaining, both clearly representing a strengthening vehicle repair center, and an improved proposition for our franchisees. Beyond the numbers, there's a great deal of optimism throughout the network. You can see if you talk to these people. The franchisees attending our 2017 kick-off events held early last month all over the country, display a great deal of enthusiasm about the vehicle repair sector in general, and about their individual businesses in particular. I participated in the kick-off and I believe the level of excitement and confidence surrounding the van channel is stronger than ever. And our optimism was acknowledged by multiple publications, listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice. Again this year, Snap-on was ranked among the top 50 in Entrepreneur's magazine's list of top 500 franchises, finishing number one in the professional tools and equipment category, and the Franchise Business Review which collects franchisee feedback, satisfaction feedback, franchisee satisfaction feedback listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the tenth consecutive year we've received that reward. Finally, and my favorite, the Military Times included Snap-on in its Best for Vets annual ranking, coming in at number five, and representing the only mobile tool franchise on the list. Now this type of recognition would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new product, many developed from insights from our customers, guided by Snap-on customer connection and invested with Snap-on technical insight and innovation. And in 2016, for the seventh straight year, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products. Those million dollar sellers developed from direct observations gained in the field. Take for instance the ATECH 300 electronic torque wrench. Launched in the fourth quarter, this latest torque offering solves an important customer problem. Many light vehicles today, pickups and SUVs, now use fasteners requiring between 250 foot pounds and 300 foot pounds of torque, and specifications for accurate measurements of those higher torques are increasing in number. The Snap-on ATECH 300 is the first light vehicle half-inch electronic torque wrench to rate at 300 foot pounds. It's lighter, more accurate, and it eliminates the need to add heavy duty tools just to accommodate the new pickup and SUV torque requirements. Designed and manufactured in our City of Industry facility in California, the ATECH 300 incorporates the same great features as our other ATECH models-a reduced profile for better accessibility, a longer handle for easily applying the extra torque, power interruption technology to prevent power resets and protect the data, and a large LCD screen for greater visibility. Franchisee feedback? Well, we launched it late in the year and it's selling out. We said, I think in many forms including this one that there's growing opportunity in vehicle precision, in torque measurement. As vehicles become more automatic, there's more need for more precision. Even in the fourth quarter we saw confirmation in that trend. Our torque line grew nicely; it's one of the reasons why we acquired the torque skills of Sturtevant Richmont and we expect good things going forward in that growing product line. Now let's move to RS&I. Volume in the fourth quarter was $319.8 million with an organic rise of 8.9%, significant gains in diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a mid single-digit increase to OEM dealerships and a low single-digit rise of undercar equipment. Operating earnings of $82.5 million increased $10.4 million to 25.8% of sales, up 10 basis points, overwhelming, overcoming the impact of the newly acquired operations. RS&I expanded across the repair shop owner and manager sector, across the full sector, but particularly with independents. Our diagnostics and repair information businesses recorded double-digit volume growth with those important customers. Our Mitchell 1 operations offers independent shops leading facility management software, innovative marketing services, and the most comprehensive repair information anywhere. Using the Snap-on Value Creation principles of customer connection and innovation, our Mitchell 1 team utilizes thousands of customer contacts every year, adding repair information for new vehicles, improving the speed to solution of its pro-demand product, and expanding the literally hundreds of millions of actual repair events in its unique sure-track big database, and in the fourth quarter the RS&I results clearly show the effect of the Mitchell 1 progress. Now for our diagnostics division, another encouraging quarter, led by ongoing success of recent product launches. We mentioned a couple of these in the third quarter : the MODIS Edge, handheld scanner, very sophisticated handheld scanner, and our thermal imager. A whole new category of vehicle diagnostics will both continue to exceed expectations, and both drove the diagnostic division to strong double-digit gains. RS&I also advanced its work station product line in the quarter, introducing the new EPIQ diagnostic work station. The EPIQ work station combines two of Snap-on's top of the line products, matching our sophisticated VERUS handheld with our EPIQ tool storage box into one custom platform. This enhanced work station is targeted for shops desiring capability. This combo will address the most challenging repairs. Convenience, everything a technician needs is right at hand. And confidence : the visible presence of the work station tells the customer that this shop is serious and sophisticated and able to tackle the most difficult of repairs. Work station sales are up nearly 40% year-over-year, and the new EPIQ combo is part of that success. The RS&I Group also includes progress with OEM dealerships. Over the years Snap-on Business Solutions, SBS, has developed an extraordinary level of insight and capability in developing and running electronic parts catalogs for dealerships. And their skills paid off in the quarter. As SBS captured the contract to provide a state of the art EPC for another major vehicle OEM, another win, and more growth for Snap-on in the OEM space. Finally in the period, the RS&I equipment division registered a low single-digit organic increase with mixed results across our North American and International Undercar operations. That said, we keep driving to expand our position with repair shops, with new products to sell and with strategic and coherent acquisitions. And in the fourth quarter, RS&I made an important addition to the equipment division with the acquisition of Car-O-Liner. The Car-O-Liner business brings greater capabilities in collision repair and strengthens our overall position in the heavy-duty segment. Given the trends in the collision space, the higher emphasis on shop efficiency and the power of matching Car-O-Liner with our other RS&I divisions, we believe this acquisition will create even more opportunities to expand with repair shop owners and managers going forward. We're excited. Well, that's our fourth quarter. OpCo organic sales growing 3.6%; EPS $2.47 in the quarter, up 13.6%. Progress along each of our runways for coherent growth, progress along those runways for coherent growth and acquisitions that will give us more to sell and make those runways even wider, and clear advancements down our runways for improvements, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and Rapid Continuous Improvement driving a 19.8% operating margin, 70 basis points higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Nick. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $889.8 million in the quarter increased $38.1 million, or 4.5% from 2015 levels, reflecting a $30 million, or 3.6% organic sales gain, $23.3 million of acquisition related sales, and $15.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q4 sales comparisons by 190 basis points. The organic sales gain reflects continued progress in serving the vehicle repair sector, as well as its sales improvements in our Commercial & Industrial segment. Consolidated gross margin of 49.9% improved 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to sales leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $267.8 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.1% in the quarter, an increase of 80 basis points, primarily due to higher acquisition related and other expenses including operating expenses for Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont, which were both acquired in the fourth quarter, as well as a 30 basis point benefit in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily from a gain on sale of a former manufacturing facility. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $176.1 million, including $3.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased 8.5% and as a percentage of sales, improved 70 basis points to 19.8%. Financial services revenue of $74.2 million in the quarter increased 17.6% from 2015 levels, and operating earnings of $51.6 million, including $0.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 14.7%. Consolidated operating earnings of $227.7 million, including $4.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 9.8%, and the operating margin of 23.6% improved 90 basis points from 22.7% a year ago. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 30.8% compared to 31.1% last year. For the full year, our 2016 effective income tax rate of 31% compared to 31.7% last year. Finally, fourth quarter net earnings of $146.3 million, or $2.47 per diluted share increased $14.9 million, or $0.25 per share from 2015 levels, representing an 11.3% increase in diluted earnings per share. For the full year 2016, earnings per diluted share of $9.20 increased 13.6% as compared to $8.10 in 2015. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group on slide 7. Sales of $286.3 million in the fourth quarter increased $4.5 million, or 1.6%, reflecting a $6.5 million, or 2.4% organic sales gain, $4.2 million of acquisition-related sales, and $6.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The $6.5 million organic sales increase primarily includes a high single-digit gain in the segment's European-based hand tools business, and a low single-digit increase to customers in critical industries, largely as a result of higher sales to the military. During the quarter, our European-based hand tools business benefited from broad-based sales growth with particular strength in countries including Sweden, Spain, and France. These organic sales gains were partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in the segment's power tools operations and lower sales in certain emerging markets. Gross profit in the C&I Group of $115.4 million compared to $107.6 million last year. The gross margin of 40.3% improved 210 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, and 100 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $71.5 million in the quarter compared to $65.7 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25% increased 170 basis points primarily as a result of higher cost, including operating expenses for new acquisitions, 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, and a 70 basis point benefit in the fourth quarter of 2015 from a gain on sale of a former manufacturing facility. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $43.9 million including $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency effects increased $2 million from 2015 levels, and the operating margin of 15.3% improved 40 basis points. Turning now to slide 8. Fourth quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $417.5 million increased $6.3 million, or 1.5%, reflecting a $12.2 million, or 3% organic sales gain and $5.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. $12.2 million organic sales increase includes a low single-digit gain in the company's U.S. franchise operations, and a mid single-digit gain in the company's International franchise operations. Gross profit of $175.5 million compared to $173.7 million last year. Gross margin of 42% declined 20 basis points, as 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects were partially offset by benefits from higher sales. Operating expenses of $102 million in the quarter were essentially flat compared to last year. The operating expense margin of 24.4% improved 30 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $73.5 million including $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $1.6 million, and the operating margin of 17.6% improved 10 basis points. Turning to the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, shown on slide 9. Fourth quarter sales of $319.8 million increased $39.2 million, or 14%, reflecting a $24.6 million, or 8.9%, organic sales gain. $19.1 million of acquisition related sales, and $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The 8.9% organic sales increase primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a mid single-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships, and a low single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment. Gross profit of $153 million compared to $131 million last year. And the gross margin of 47.8% improved 110 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $70.5 million in the quarter compared to $58.9 million last year. The operating expense margin of 22% increased 100 basis points, primarily due to a 90 basis point impact from the Car-O-Liner acquisition. Fourth quarter operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $82.5 million, including $1.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $10.4 million from prior year levels, and the operating margin of 25.8% improved 10 basis points. Now, turning to slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $51.6 million on revenue of $74.2 million compared to operating earnings of $45 million on revenue of $63.1 million last year. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses of 1.3% in the quarter compared with 1.2% last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 18.2% in the quarter compared to 17.8% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.3% compared to 9.5% last year. Originations of $260.3 million in the quarter increased 3.3% from prior year levels. Moving to slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.8 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.6 billion from our U.S. operations. Approximately 81% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In 2016, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $224 million, or 14.1%. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these continued to be in line with our expectations, including a seasonal rise in delinquencies. In this fourth quarter, we experienced a slightly higher seasonal increase in delinquencies and the allowance was increased accordingly. Overall, profitability in the financial services segment rose by 14.7% in the quarter, reflecting both continued growth of the overall portfolio and higher average yields on finance receivables. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $151.7 million in the quarter increased $7.3 million from comparable 2015 levels as higher net earnings were partially offset by net changes in operating asset and liabilities, including $20 million of discretionary U.S. pension contributions. Net cash used by investing activities of $229.3 million included $160.4 million for the combined acquisitions of Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont, $53.6 million to fund a net increase in finance receivables, and $17.7 million of capital expenditures. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $74.3 million. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $36.3 million from 2015 year-end levels, reflecting higher sales, $21.5 million of receivables related to acquisitions and an increase in days sales outstanding from 60 days at 2015 year-end to 63 days at 2016 year-end partially offset by $13.8 million of foreign currency translation. Excluding acquisitions, days sales outstanding was 61 days. Inventories increased $32.7 million from 2015 year-end levels primarily support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions and $21.5 million of inventories related to acquisitions, partially offset by $17.8 million of foreign currency translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.3 compared with 3.5 turns at 2015 year-end. Excluding acquisitions, inventory turns were 3.4. Our year-end cash position of $77.6 million decreased $15.2 million from 2015 year-end levels. The net decrease reflects the funding of $915 million of new finance receivables, acquisitions of $160.4 million, dividend payments of $147.5 million, the repurchase of 758,000 shares for $120.4 million, and $74.3 million for capital expenditures. These cash decreases were largely offset by $671.7 million of cash collections from finance receivables, $567.3 million of cash from operations and $134.2 million of proceeds from a net increase in notes payable and other short-term borrowings. Our net debt to capital ratio of 26.3% compared with 24.6% at 2015 year-end. In addition to our $77.6 million of cash, and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us to access the commercial paper markets. As of 2016 year-end we had $130 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Since year-end, on January 17 we repaid $150 million of 5.5% senior notes at maturity with available cash and commercial paper. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2017. We anticipate that capital expenditures in 2017 will be in a range of $80 million to $90 million. We also expect that our full-year 2017 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our 2016 full-year rate of 31%. This assumes no major changes in existing U.S. federal regulations \u2013 tax regulations. Should there be definitive legislation on corporate tax reform, we will assess the effects of such at that time. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Aldo. Well, you heard about our year and our fourth quarter. I believe they represent continuing confirmation of the opportunities along our runways for growth and testimony to the possibilities inherent in Snap-On value creation and our runways for improvement. C&I growing again in a very turbulent environment, finding the opportunities where they exist in critical industries, continuing the upward trend in Europe in difficult and uncertain economies, reaching an OI margin of 15.3%, one of its highest, up 40 basis points. The Tools Group growing, not equal to recent periods, but still displaying the hallmarks of continuing achievement : a robust vehicle repair sector, positive franchisee health, strong product introductions, and a continuing enthusiasm across the franchisees and the customers. And through it all, profit growth, OI margin of 17.6%, up 10 basis points, despite a 70 basis-point headwind from unfavorable currency. And RS&I, 8.9% organic growth, confirming the strength of vehicle repair, progress with independent shops and dealerships, exciting new products spearheading those advancements, and OI margins reaching 25.8%, up despite the impact of Car-O-Liner and its lower profit levels. And the acquisitions, Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont adding more product fuel for growth and providing more opportunity for improvement. It all came together to bring our OpCo operating margin to 19.8%, up 70 basis points. And when you add Financial Services, the overall operating margin was 23.6%, up 90 basis points. It was an encouraging quarter and an encouraging year. And we believe we have the market and the position and the team to continue the trend of extended positive performance through 2017 and beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know, again, many of you are listening. The progress accomplished is a direct reflection of the capability and perseverance you contribute to our effort. For your achievements in the quarter and the year, you have my congratulations, and for your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : We'll take our first question from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Good morning, guys. It's David Kelley on for Bret this morning. Just a couple quick questions. And first on RS&I, strong organic growth in the quarter, Just want to drill down on the double-digit diagnostics growth you pointed out. Was there something specific to the quarter that drove the robust performance there, given some of the cadence of.... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yes, there was. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Go ahead. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yes, there was, there was. Look, the thing is, as we said, we launched two dynamite new products and actually the thermal imager for us is a whole new category of diagnosing a vehicle, not data driven but physically driven by looking at a vehicle. Like, for example, if you're looking for a bad cylinder, it's tough to tell from the electronic diagnostics, but you can tell if you focus the thermal imager on it and see which one is hot. That changed everything. That created a lot of volume in that situation, a lot of attention for diagnostics. And then the MODIS Edge was another extension of our already pretty robust line, but a pretty good tool. So those two really drove the business into that 8.9%. Then you had the Mitchell 1 had its usual strong performance in terms of selling to shops. And then we had some comeback with dealerships, which can be lumpy. The lumpy side can be dealerships. But mostly, the story is new product. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Great. No, appreciate the color. And I guess given the favorable secular tailwind that should benefit that sector, how do we think about maybe longer-term organic growth opportunity in RS&I looking out over the next two to three years? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, we always say, look, it's 4% to 6%. That's what we're targeting in most environments. We expect RS&I to be in the middle of that, and the RS&I numbers in the last three years are 4.9%, 4.9%, 4.7%. But this particular one with these new products we feel pretty positive. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. Thanks. And then one more from me and I'll pass it along. Just on the Tools growth, I was wondering if maybe you'd be able to give us a feel for cadence in the quarter. I was wondering if there was any pickup late in December or any uptick you've even seen in January year-to-date that's contributing to that confidence in a rebound in 2017 here. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: No. Look, okay, the Tools Group was not equal to its normal trend, but 3% isn't a poke in the eye with a stick in a 1.9% economy. So we still feel okay about that. But you could have reasonably expected more. But everything we look at, the enthusiasm of the market, the strength of our product, our franchisees, how they react, we feel pretty positive about that. So what I'm saying is, is that you look at those numbers and you may say, below trend but in anything you look at from a physical point of view or for a conversational point of view or seeing a product pipeline point of view, you feel confident. David L. Kelley - Jefferies LLC : Okay, great. Again, appreciate the color. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from David Leiker from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Morning. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Morning. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Guys, just as a follow-up on that last question on the Tools side, is there anything \u2013 obviously, that number is a lot weaker than what we've been seeing here for actually quite a while. Is there anything from a timing perspective or regional perspective or anything as you dig down inside there that could give us a little bit more color? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: No, I don't think so. The timing is not really \u2013 we have up weeks and down weeks. It's hard to make any interpretation in that, David. I think simply stated, I hate to use an analogy like this, but sometimes your clean-up hitter hits a single and a double and doesn't hit a homerun and you still win the game, and that's the way we see this quarter. I wouldn't use the word weaker 3%. I hate to use that word because I think it's a reasonable growth, but yeah, it is below trend and we are unsatisfied with that number. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I know you don't talk about numbers on a go-forward basis, but can you give us any sense of what our proper expectation should get zeroed in on as we look at 2017 for that business? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, we always say our growth is going to be in the 4% to 6% range, and that's the kind of thing we think of. And Tools Group grew at 5.6% in the last quarter \u2013 I mean last year, sorry, last year. And so I don't think we see anything to interrupt our trajectory, let's put it that way. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then the second item here is on the credit company. When you dig down into the credit stats, some of them at the margin are getting a little bit weaker I guess. The losses are up, the delinquencies, there's some seasonality there. The originations growth, which I'm sure is tied into the Tools number. But can you talk a little bit about what you're doing there? Your allowances you said you took up a little bit, but it looks like the losses are a little bit. Is this something that's just an adjustment, or do you think this is a start of a trend? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, I'll speak to the originations. Look, originations is in the Tools Group (44:02), it follows the Tools Group. And fundamentally in the quarter what you see is high growth in the diagnostics area. The diagnostics products were the hottest, in particular the thermal imager, which tends to be at the bottom end of the diagnostics range, we would still classify it as big ticket. But the origination, the credit penetration in that area of diagnostics tends to be lower. So you fundamentally look at the characteristics of the diagnostic sales and we shake our head and say, yes, lower administration, makes a lot of sense based on what we sold in the Tools Group. And so that's kind of our view in that \u2013 and It's perfectly explainable in those kinds of situations and seeing what happens with the Tools Group. It's a lot less change next quarter because of the characteristics of what sells and what new products come out. In terms of the reserves, I'll let Aldo talk about that. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, David, if you look at the cash flow statement, you'll see that our provision, if you look year-over-year, it's up about $4.4 million, just to give you a little color on that. If you just still look at what I would call the normal sized growth in the portfolio, that would account for about a third of the provision. So you have, yes, two-thirds of extra growth in the provision relates to the delinquency and characteristics of the trends. So at the end of the quarter, we think the reserve's adjusted accordingly. It reflects that. And as we move forward, we're not alarmed by any of the statistics. These are within the range of deviation that we've seen over recent times, so we're comfortable. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I got a few emails this morning. There are some who are saying that that's a sign that the end market, that your customer is weakening, and that the credit company is the canary in the coal mine. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, we don't see the end market weakening, actually. That was the whole point of half of my script here. I don't think we see that to the extent that anything we see \u2013 I was just on a van the other day, two days ago, and it didn't seem that way. I was in the garages and those guys seemed pretty robust in their view of the world, talking about how they've had to turn away business, in fact. I know this is a windshield survey, but in terms of the kickoffs were three weeks ago. And we all go out all over the country and everybody came back saying, our guys are more pumped than ever before. So we don't see that, anyway. We don't see the end-market weakening at all. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then just one quick housekeeping question, Aldo, on the acquisitions. It looks like the revenue contribution there was more than just what you would think given the calendar and the timing of the acquisitions. Is there some seasonality in there that skewed that contribution? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: There is a bit. If you look at the collision business itself, the fourth quarter tends to be one of their better quarters. We owned Car-O-Liner practically speaking for a full two months, Sturtevant Richmont to a lesser extent was really only about a little over about five-, six-week ownership period. But yes, the collision business does skew a bit to the fourth quarter. David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. And thank you very much. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David MacGregor at Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a question on the Tools segment. Can you just talk a little bit about the growth you saw in big ticket versus smaller ticket business? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: I think ticket was up, but it was \u2013 when we say that big ticket you can classify it into three pieces or three general pieces, David. You've got the tool storage boxes, right. They're the biggest of the big ticket, and almost all of them get financed. And then you've got diagnostics that goes through a range. And then you have some other dribs and drabs, like we'll sell welders and things like that, but that is not a big ticket item. Big ticket grew faster in Tools Group, but the lion's share of that growth was in the diagnostic product, the MODIS Edges, which are expensive, and they are \u2013 maybe list price is probably $6,000, $5,999, something like that. And then you've got the thermal imager, which was at the bottom of the range. The list price is somewhere I think around $1,300, $1,400. So the thing is, is that you've got a lower end at that level. So your big ticket was greater than the Tools Group, but more anchored in the lower end of big ticket than in maybe the quarters we've been used to lately. Tool storage was slightly off this quarter. So the tool storage representation was not as strong in this. So thus the smaller originations than it used to because thermal imagers, the penetration, the need for financing is a lot lower than for tool storage box. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : You're talking about stronger diagnostics. I realize in response to an earlier question you said timing wasn't an issue here, but I know you ran a storage promotion in late third quarter. Is it possible you just pulled forward some storage out of 4Q into 3Q, and that's accounting for the slower growth? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: No, maybe. There's a lot of things. I think \u2013 I don't know. Fundamentally these kinds of things are fairly judgmental in that situation (49:23). That's certainly a possibility, although we don't think \u2013 we try not to pull ahead those kinds of things, but certainly launches of new products really affect this kind of thing. And remember that you're talking about difference between 3% growth and 6% growth in the Tools Group, you're talking about one set of sockets once a week for every franchisee. So it's a difficult thing to \u2013 when you're talking about those differences, it's a difficult thing to pin down exactly the results. I would say if you're talking about tool storage, the biggest effect was hot diagnostics taking a lot of attention. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Same question. Just your net income margin continues to grow. You're now up to pretty impressive 16%. Just given the operating leverage in the business, is there an upside to this number in 2017 when materials' costs are going to be re-inflating and maybe big ticket growth in Tools may be slowing? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah. There is. I mean I think we say that we keep driving up the margin, there's a lot of reasons for this. I mean fundamentally we see a lot of opportunities even today for improvement in Snap-On in every division, that's number one. Number two is, yes, material prices are rising, but we don't buy that much and you've never heard me explain on this call variance associated with material costs and we've made a couple of acquisitions now that gives us more grist for the Snap-On value creation mill. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: So I see lots of opportunities there still. So I don't think, by no means have we hit the top anywhere. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Last question for me. Just on the balance sheet. You ended another year with roughly 1 times net debt-to-EBITDA. You're doing bolt-on transactions, you've obviously been successful in augmenting growth. But just given the strength of your free cash flow, is the capacity here to continue to bolt-ons and grow the dividend while also accelerating your share repurchase activity? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah, Dave, it's Aldo. Our principal focus for free cash flow is to look for investment opportunities whether that be organic or by way of acquisitions, that is what we look to. And, again, our strategy along share repurchase is still more or less to offset dilution. And, again, we continue to make contributions into our pension plan. So as we go forward and things change, we'll reexamine those on a quarterly basis, but that's kind of the pecking order right now. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Gary Prestopino from Barrington Research Associates. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. A lot of the questions relating to the Tools Group have been answered, but, Nick, I mean, with the Rock 'N Roll Express vans, which I understand are the ones that are selling these big ticket storage items, have you been increasing that on an absolute basis? Or year-over-year is it pretty steady in terms of the units that are out there? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Bingo! It was flat, but we increased the Techno-Vans, which sells diagnostics. We moved those up 10% in the quarter, 20% year-over-year. So that's a relevant question. I didn't add that before, but that's one of the things that helped drive the diagnostics business. It all come together, new product and more power in the field's marketing of all this. Now, as I've said in the past, I'm not so sure that has an effect, and the fact that we didn't increase Rock 'N Roll vans doesn't necessarily have an effect because we think we get better every quarter at using them, but the fact is we haven't increased them for some time. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. So that helps. And then the other thing you mentioned in your commentary that it was a record number of hit products this year, which I assume a hit product is one that generates over a million of sales. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Exactly. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Could you give us an idea of the magnitude of that growth on a percentage basis, or just the absolute number of hit products... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: I'll just say, I don't like to talk about the absolute number because I don't want to get pinned to the cross of reporting on hit products every year. But I'll just tell you this, versus 10 years ago we've reached more than 6 times. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: And we keep growing on a regular basis. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Scott Stember from C.L. King. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Could you maybe talk about currency, I know that heading into the back part of the year, before Brexit we were hoping that we'd get some bouncing out or some flattening of currency, but with the sterling falling off the way that it did certainly it started to hurt. But we've seen the pound actually rebound somewhat. Can you maybe just give us an idea of what your reset expectations are for 2017 for when we could start to see a bottom with impact from currency? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Just to ground ourselves, in the fourth quarter we took about a $15 million hit in revenue from currency and about $0.05 or $4 million on the bottom line in currency. And for the full year we had about $50 million, just north of $50 million, $51.5 million and $0.26 or $23 million in currency. Looking forward, this is the darndest thing; at the end of the year we would have said same stuff. It would have been the same numbers, right. When we looked at it we figured we're going to see more or less the same currency effect that we had last year. You kind of rolled it out maybe a little different in conversation. But since the year-end things have changed, and we think the currency number's kind of half, for ballpark numbers you can kind of look at a half type currency. Look, maybe a little bit more than that early, right now if rates stay right where they are today we think it ends up being about half. And the interesting thing about this is we talked about delinquencies and provisions in the credit company. The effect of currency, the $23 million, is humongous compared to our noise around that. And of course currencies can always change, so tomorrow I may wake up and this may all be different. But if you took them today, we'd expect some relief. And that relief would be big, would be nice. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. And going over to RS&I, you broke out some of the categories. I missed the growth for the independent shop owners. Could you give that number again? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Oh, we're saying double-digit growth for the independent shop owners. The repairs, the diagnostics and software for the independent repair shop owners, Mitchell 1 sells the software in terms of SureTrack with the hundreds of millions of dollars of records of repair. And then diagnostics is the hardware and software-based sale, things like a thermal imager or a handheld diagnostic that will decode everything a car wants to say. So if you take that together it's like double-digits. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Right. And just last question, you talked about the undercar equipment business being, I think, you said low single-digits. Could you just maybe flesh that out? Whether weather-related products for the wheel, tire aligners, wheel aligners and (56:42)... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: I don't know. I hear all that, but I'm not sure I believe it. The thing is that every time I go in a garage sometimes the guys will tell me the weather has shafted us, and other people will say, the snow will make it bad for us because people can't get in. Other people will say the snow makes it good because they have a lot more procedures. So I'm not so sure how to play with that. What I will tell you about this is the Europeans tend to follow this. And the European business was much more sluggish compared to the North American business in this particular area. And Eastern Europe hasn't been too good to us in the equipment business either. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. That's all I have. Thanks again. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Okay. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Liam Burke from Wunderlich. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Thank you, and good morning, Nick. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Good morning, Liam. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Nick, on C&I you've invested a fair amount in emerging markets. Are you seeing any meaningful move there to help absorb some of that upfront investment? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: No. I wish I could say that I was, but the problem is, it seems like when we take one step forward, we take a step backwards in another place. For example, we're up in China this year, India difficult. I'm sure you're probably familiar with the demonetization in India and people ran out of cash. And a lot of our smaller distributors do a cash business, so our business went \u2013 kind of weakened in the third quarter. So we're seeing that kind of balance. The turbulence has bedeviled us lately in terms of Indonesia being down and Thailand being up. So we see progress from a physical point of view, I feel better about the business, but we haven't been able to monetize it yet. I'm confident we will, but it hasn't been a meaningful contributor to us. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Okay. In terms of RCI... Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: It will be though. It will be. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: I'm just saying, I'm confident it will be. But it hasn't been yet because we're managing over all those differences. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And on RCI, you talk about, obviously, the internal processes. You've moved that out to the van channel, Rock 'N Roll Van and \u2013 are some of the examples. Do you have any RCI programs pushed out to the van channel beyond the company-owned vans? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, yeah. I mean the thing is, is that a couple of things. Of course, increasingly the franchisees are deciding on their own to add assistants. Now we have about 20% of them up with assistants; I think there's 695 or something like that, up about 20% year-over-year. And that gives them more \u2013 in effect adds time to each van. And what we've done is, we've put programs in place to support them : new computer systems, tablets that allow them to have two people wandering around a garage or separated off the van and can still have a cash register in their hand. And so that's been a kind of positive event. That's one thing I can think of for sure. And then, of course, just this quarter we expanded the Techno-Vans, another 10% growth quarter-over-quarter, 20% year-over-year. And that saves time because it puts an expert at the beck and call of a franchisee for a short period of time, and it also gives him and expands his selling space. So the Techno-Vans both amplify the time and allow him to time share more space for selling. So you have those two things going on. There's a number of smaller things which we focus on in terms of how they're going to manage their inventory, how they're going to do other things. Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Nick. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Richard Hilgert at the Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thanks, Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to ask about future technologies in the industry. We're hearing more and more about hybrids coming sooner, battery electrics coming sooner, and obviously some of these things are already out there today, along with autonomous features of vehicles. Are you already developing tools for some of these areas, and if so, what are some of the areas that you're already seeing coming through for new tooling and electronics diagnostics? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. I mean we are developing, actually remember : change is our friend. It requires the mechanic to change his tool set and to get new implements to allow him to repair these cars. And make no mistake about it, they need repair. And so we are working on this but just to be clear, unfortunately for us, it ain't happening next Thursday. There are 300 million vehicles on the road in North America and a very micro-percentage of them are really hybrids and electronic, even today. But we are doing new things. For example, hybrids and electronics, we have a whole line of insulating tools. If you're poking around inside those engine compartments whether they are electric or hybrid, there's a lot of voltage in there, you don't want to get fried. And in fact there's a lot of danger. So a whole set of tools has to be used to particularly do that and we have them available. In terms of automated cars, that's what I was talking about in terms of torque. Any time a car becomes more reliant on a system, it requires more calibration, more precise adjustment. And torque is one of the things that's more important. Of course, there's a whole bunch of other things like alignment and tire balancing, and a number of things that emanate from precision that opens up a whole new range of opportunities for us. So as cars become more automatic, we're investing in torque. You heard me talk about the AT300. Because of the need for that precision, that's why the SUVs and light trucks are requiring this precise torques of such large numbers. They didn't used to do that. And in terms of things like lane departure systems or self-parks or adjusting automated cruise control, they all need more of this and that means precision. That's why we're buying in the torque sector because we believe this is a natural emanation of it. And one of the bright spots of the Tools Group in the fourth quarter was torque was up substantially, verifying that, confirming that view of the world. Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Great. My other question, it deals with some of the questions that I'm getting from investors with respect to the finance operations. Aldo, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the credit policy there and how it works. Some of the pushback I get is that there's concern that the franchisees are given too much credit authority, and that collecting it back might be more difficult for them. Is there any kind of comments you can make about the credit policy standards right now? And the fact that the business isn't necessarily growing because policies are getting weak, it's just a matter of the business and its natural growth rates? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah, Richard. I think that last word is a good one. The business policy of sorts is to rely heavily on our experience. And when I say our experience that also includes the experience curve of the franchisees themselves. We have a traditional database that you get reports from various agencies and credit bureaus and things of that nature. We have our own internal history, which means a lot, and we keep that as a reservoir of information at the credit company. And we actually stripe and monitor the progress that our franchisees make along their path through a career in this business and track trends, and are able to instill in them some training. We provide training when we go to the periodic conferences. But they are in a position to meet their customers up close and personal each and every week for the most part, and offer back to the credit company, an informed credit decision that might not be apparent in the bureaus or in the database, such as, what's the peer group feedback on that technician in a garage. What is the garage itself doing? Is there a stream of work or does it look like a garage vulnerable to a downturn? My point is that there's a lot of information resident in the franchisees and their own employees, because some of them do have employees. And we try to incorporate that into our final decision when we make a credit choice. So as the model evolves, it's always enhanced. As the franchisees attempt to grow, they reach into new spaces, they meet new customers, those customers will have different credit profiles. And you adjust accordingly along the way. Richard Hilgert - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Very good. Thanks again for taking my questions. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. Operator : Thank you. And it appears we have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Savannah. We appreciate everyone joining the call today. A replay will be available on snapon.com shortly. And as always, we thank you for your interest in the company. Good day. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time and have a great day.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks, Laurie and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on\u2019s first quarter results, which are detailed on our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provide some closing thoughts, we\u2019ll take your questions. As usual, we\u2019ve provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab and the webcast viewer, as well as on our website, snapon.com, under investor information. These slides will be archived on our website, along with the transcript of today\u2019s call. Any statements made during this call relative to management\u2019s expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management\u2019s or the company\u2019s outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I\u2019ll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter. Along the way, we\u2019ll look at results, the markets, the progress we\u2019ve made and I\u2019ll give you a perspective on what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financial. We believe that our first quarter has convincing confirmation of Snap-on\u2019s ability to continue its trajectory of positive results to overcome period to period variations from business-to-business to offset macroeconomic headwinds and to still keep advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our reported sales in the quarter of $887.1 million were up 6.3%, including $29.1 million in acquisition related sales, partially offset by $9.6 million in unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 4.1%, with increases registered by every group. Those gains together with continued contributions from Snap-on Value Creation Processes, the principles we use every day, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, combined offer another encouraging quarter. Our EPS was $2.39, up 10.6% from last year\u2019s $2.16. The increase includes an opco operating margin of 19.1%, 50 basis points higher than last year and that rise overcame a 50 basis points unfavorable impact from acquisitions. When you combine those current opco gains with earnings of $52.5 million from the financial services, it brings Snap-on\u2019s consolidated operating margin to 23%, up from the 22.5% in 2016. Now let me pause here to note that these acquisitions may be margin attenuators at this point, but they\u2019re actually landscapes that are fertile ground for Snap-on Value Creation. As we go forward, they\u2019re actually great opportunities to achieve margin improvement \u2013 margin growth. Now let\u2019s look at the markets. We believe the auto repair market remains relatively robust. The Tools Group, organic sales growth somewhat lower than in previous quarters, but still positive, solving technician problems and making our franchise network more prosperous and more powerful. And in the Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I group, another vehicle repair business, encouraging strength in the quarter, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage, capitalizing on a broader product line. Within innovative new tools like the digital thermal imager and new acquisitions like Car-O-Liner, all leading to growth in independent repair shops as well as OEM dealerships across the group. C&I, the businesses that served critical industries, a wide range of industries and is the most international of our groups. And in the quarter, the results showed progress despite some challenged industrial sectors and some troubled geographies, and critical industries improvement in the natural resources segment overcoming the continuing economic turbulence in places like the Middle East and the impact on our international aviation business. At SNA Europe, mid-single-digit growth with strength in places like the UK, Spain, France, Italy, and the Nordic region, mitigating difficulties in Eastern Europe. And from our Asia Pacific division, solid increases in key countries like China and India. So overall, I described our C&I markets is improving. Challenges still exist, but we took advantage of the opportunities that were available, and we\u2019re encouraged by our advancements in the quarter. And those activities, together with our auto repair related businesses combined to drive overall progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the Van network, expanding the repair shop owners and managers extending to critical industry, building an emerging market. Advancements leveraging our widening product line and increasing our understanding of work, growth and critical sectors and important geographies. That\u2019s an overview of the markets. Now let\u2019s talk about the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were up 3%, with mid-single-digit growth in European hand tools business and low-single-digit rise in volume to our customers in critical industries. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $41.6 million representing an operating margin of 13.9%, a decrease of 40 basis points, which reflects higher investment spending for product development and engineering activities in that group. As part of C&I, we remain committed to extending in critical industries and we\u2019ll keep strengthening our position to capture new business opportunities in those areas as they arise. Along those lines, we\u2019ve seen some recent gains with natural resources customers, helped by our line of innovative new products, designed especially to make work easier in that uniquely challenging Industrial setting. Oil and gas can be tough, we have the products. One example is our collection of Snap-on 3/8\u201d drive torque adapters, manufactured in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant. It\u2019s a new product family, used in applications where access is difficult and precision is critical, and natural resources in mining on a variety of large earth moving equipments. Produced from special high alloy steel, precision-forged and especially heat-treated, these tools have a double hex 12-point that allows fasteners to be engaged every 30 degrees instead of the standard every 60 degrees, a feature that provides better angles for grip and easier operation in restricted areas. The adapter length, crucial for measuring torque is very precise and it\u2019s etched on the tool for easy reference. The new torque adapter family is a great addition to our lineup and it fills a vital need for our critical industry customers. Now I already mentioned SNA Europe\u2019s mid-single-digit organic sales growth. That progress was broad based across the landscape and including some, what I would say were fairly difficult regions and countries. SNA Europe\u2019s positive trend to performance now extends 14 straight quarters with year-over-year sales growth, and actually include 16 straight quarters of margin improvement. It\u2019s quite a record in a region that\u2019s marked by so much uncertainty. Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales up 2.5%, the operating margin was 17.2% \u2013 the operating margin of 17.2% was up 60 basis points versus the 16.6% recorded last year, and that\u2019s despite 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Let me say that again. 17.2%, up 60 basis points against 70 basis points of unfavorable currency. The Tools volume story simply put our Techno-Vans keep \u2013 kept coming \u2013 our Techno-Vans kept coming, but the Rock \u2018N Roll vans cabs were less effective and that big-ticket combination was less favorable than usual. We do believe however, that this runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise channel remains very strong and there\u2019s evidence of that strength of an ongoing positive trajectory across the Van channel. And our franchise metrics, the important financial and physical indicators that we monitor them very closely and again, this quarter, they remain favorable. There\u2019s also a testimony in our direct interactions with the franchisees, at events like this year\u2019s kickoff meetings, held all over the network. At the very recent meetings with the National Franchisee Advisory Council and at separate interactions with individual franchisees, all of these have been marked by enthusiasm and optimism. Our franchisees, all of them, entrepreneurs and professionals are confident in reaching higher and optimistic regarding the upcoming opportunities and some of that enthusiasm rests on a new product that\u2019s rolling out to drive new excitement. For example, the great addition to our tool lineup is the Snap-on [indiscernible] 3/8\u201d drive ratchet. Again, manufactured in Elizabethton, Tennessee, comes with a flexible head, extra long handle, better access in tight automotive applications and additional leverage within those that\u2019s what the long handles for, additional leverage within those cramped spaces. It\u2019s got a sealed head to keep lubricants in and contaminants out, and that bodes a longer life. And of course, it includes the Snap-on\u2019s patent. Our patented Dual 80 technology, featuring 80 teeth gear for minimum swing arch, and dual pawls for strength. You put this 80 teeth together, small swing and the arch, dual pulls make it strong, you got the long handle for leverage, a design for flexibility, strength and compact operation. We believe we\u2019ve got a great hand tool in our new 3/8\" extra-long flex head ratchet. And you heard me talk about hit products before. It will be one of this year\u2019s hit products. We\u2019re also rolling out a new tool storage program. A brand-new color, striking trim options, some great new promotions, we all know that tool storage activity thrives on excitement while our new package is aimed at creating that buzz and it\u2019s based on early reactions, it\u2019ll do the job. Also just recently launched was the Snap-on PT850 1/2\u201d drive impact wrench. It\u2019s a signature product, a top-of-the-line pneumatic offering that is a power of MG725, but providing more enhanced balance for comfort and control and durability. Comfort in a lighter weight package, better grip positioning for improved balance with ergonomic improvements to reduce fatigue when you\u2019re using it all day. Control, a compact design with a favorable trigger for applying the right torque for the job. Easy to control, even while wearing gloves in the shop. And durability, two-piece housing with an aircraft grade aluminum nose, solid steel impact mechanism, forged steel frame and hammers and a precision cast, hard coated aluminum cylinder. That\u2019s going to last for a long time. Made in our Murphy, North Carolina facility, a new Snap-On PT850 1/2\u201d drive impact, this is a great wrench, power, comfort, control and durability. These are the features our customers want in the power tool and early sales confirm that this tool is right on target. Now let\u2019s speak of RS&I. First quarter organic sales rose 7.8%, with high single-digit gains registered pretty much across the board with diagnostics and information product independent shop with the business focused on OEM dealers and with undercar equipment. And on a reported basis, RS&I\u2019s $21.3 million acquisition-related and are reported basis including the group\u2019s, the RS&I\u2019s group $21.3 million of acquisition-related sales. First quarter volume rose 14.3% compared to last year. Operating earnings of $78.7 million increased $9.7 million from 2016, and operating margin of 24.7% was flat with last year, but with strong volume and RCI improvement, offsetting 140 basis points of negative impacts from the acquisitions. As I said before, fertile ground for margin improvement. We\u2019re clearly seeing the potential of our runways for growth in the RS&I group, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions providing greater reach like in collision repair in Car-O-Liner\u2019s and new \u2013 really new capabilities and products for our team and they can wield them. RS&I\u2019s organic growth in the quarter was broad. It was broad based across every division. I just mentioned the progress with independent shop owners, and those gains were clearly evident in the ongoing success of our powerful MODIS Edge handheld and the spread of the digital thermal imager. It\u2019s becoming an essential product for top-flight mechanics. The rise can also \u2013 that rise, that gain can also be seen in our latest software release, which not only contains expanded new model coverage, but also incorporates additions like motorcycle information and enhanced key fob reprogramming. It\u2019s sold quite well and it\u2019s fortified our advantage in our clear advantage in comprehensive repair, people repair information. For undercar equipment, sales were up high single-digits. Contributing to that increase was RS&I\u2019s introduction of the smart speed tire changer, the new unit \u2013 this new unit incorporates Snap-on\u2019s proprietary and patented technology to minimize floor to floor or tech time needed to mount a tire. A big factor in shops was handling a lot of tires, and there and are quite a few of those high-volume locations. You can see them everywhere. Tires are more sophisticated and more difficult to change than ever. Low profile tires for example, make up 25% of the market and are growing and their rigid construction makes them more susceptible to handling damage and require much more \u2013 they require much more care during the tire changing process. Our smart speed systems eliminate a great deal of that risk. It continuously monitors the power to the motor and automatically selects the turntable speed at which the motor has the correct amount of torque, that mount the tire without harm and in the fastest time. We often speak of customer connection activities and observation in the workplace, gaining insights to make work easier for our customers. Well, repair shop owners and managers are continually seeking the highest possible throughput. We observe that tire damage by torque mismatch is a big contributor to delay in those shops. So for owners and managers, the smart speed tire changer that matches that torque to the tire, makes life easier and saves time and saves money. It\u2019s a great addition to the equipment line and initial customer feedback has been quite enthusiastic, really enthusiastic. Finally, RS&I got a real boost in the quarter by the increased activity from OEM dealerships, up high single-digits, driven in particular by several significant essential diagnostic and essential tool programs for large automotive, heavy duty trucks and agricultural OEMs. It appears as though the focus on repair across the industry continues to be robust. So those are the highlights of the quarter, overcoming headwinds, continued progress, organic sales rising 4.1%, gains that change through our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, strengthening our businesses and driving to its 19.1% opco operating margin up 50 basis points overcoming the acquisition, and EPS of $2.39, up 10.6%. It was an encouraging quarter. Now let\u2019s turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $887.1 million in the quarter increased $52.9 million or 6.3% from 2016 levels, reflecting a $33.4 million or 4.1% organic sales gain, $29.1 million of acquisition related sales and $9.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q1 sales comparisons by 130 basis points. The organic sales gain reflects continued progress in serving the vehicle repair sector as well as further recovery in sales to Industrial market segments in our C&I Group. Consolidated gross margin of 50.5% improved 70 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $278.5 million yielded an operating expense margin of 31.4% in the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points as operating expenses for acquisitions and unfavorable foreign currency effects were partially offset by benefits from sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $169.5 million, increased 9.1% and as a percentage of sales, improved 50 basis points to 19.1%. The operating margin of 19.1% in the quarter reflects a 50 basis point impact from acquisitions and 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Financial services revenue of $76.8 million increased 10.5% from 2016 levels, and operating earnings of $52.5 million, including $0.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $5.5 million. Consolidated operating earnings of $222 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 9.7%, and the operating margin of 23% improved 50 basis points from 22.5% a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 30.7% compared to 31% last year. Finally, net earnings of $141.6 million, or $2.39 per diluted share increased $13.3 million, or $0.23 per share from 2016 levels, representing a 10.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $298.7 million in the quarter, increased $11.7 million, or 4.1%, reflecting an $8.6 million, or 3% organic sales gain, $7.8 million of acquisition-related sales, and $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The $8.6 million organic sales increase primarily includes a high mid single-digit gain in the segment\u2019s European-based hand tools business, and a low single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries, with improving sales trends in the natural resources segment. Gross profit in the C&I Group of $116.6 million compared to $110.5 million last year. The gross margin of 39% improved 50 basis points, primarily due to favorable foreign currency effects partially offset by a 10 basis points impact from acquisitions. Operating expenses of $75 million in the quarter compared to $69.4 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.1% increased 90 basis points primarily due to increased cost including higher cost for research and engineering activities and 20 basis points of operating expenses for acquisitions. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $41.6 million including $0.9 million of favorable foreign currency effects increased $0.5 million from 2016 levels, the operating margin of 13.9% decrease in that 40 basis points from 14.3% last year. Turning now to Slide 8. First quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $409.4 million increased $6.9 million, or 1.7%, reflecting a $10.1 million, or 2.5% organic sales gain and $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The $10.1 million organic sales increase reflects higher sales in both the U.S. and international franchise operations. Gross profit of $177.1 million in the quarter compared to $173.2 million last year. Gross margin of 43.3% improved 30 basis points, primarily due to benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $106.8 million in the quarter were essentially flat for 2016 levels. The operating expense margin of 26.1% improved 30 basis points primarily due to sales volume leverage. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $70.3 million, including $3.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $3.6 million. And the operating margin of 17.2% improved 60 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9. First quarter sales of $318.8 million increased $40 million, or 14.3%, reflecting a $21.6 million, or 7.8%, organic sales gain. $21.3 million of acquisition related sales, and $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The 7.8% organic sales increase was broad based primarily reflecting high single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, as well as a high single-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships. Gross profit of $154.3 million in the quarter compared to $131.6 million last year. And the gross margin of 48.4% improved 120 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, and 70 basis points of benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses of $75.6 million in the quarter compared to $62.6 million last year. The operating expense margin of 23.7% increased 120 basis points principally due to 200 basis points of unfavorable impact from acquisitions, partially offset by benefits from sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $78.7 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $9.7 million from prior year levels. The operating margin of 24.7% was unchanged from last year, despite 140 basis points of the impact from acquisitions. Now, turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $52.5 million on revenue of $76.8 million compared to operating earnings of $47 million on revenue of $66.3 million last year. Financial services expenses of $24.3 million in increased $5 million, primarily due to changes in both the size of the portfolio and in the provisions for credit losses. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses of 1.3% in the quarter compared to 1.2% last year. The average yield on finance receivables of 18.0% in the quarter was up slightly from 17.9% last year, and the average yield on contract receivables of 9.3% compared to 9.5% last year. Originations were $264.6 million in both the first quarters of 2017 and 2016. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.86 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.63 billion from our U.S. operations. Approximately 82% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first quarter, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $48.7 million, or 2.7%. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these are tracking somewhat higher year-over-year, but continued to be in line with our expectations in view of an appropriate risk reward balance in this segment part of our business. Additionally, the 60-day delinquency rate in the U.S. extend the credit portfolio improved by 20 basis points in line with typical seasonality. Overall, profitability in the financial services segment rose by 11.7% in the quarter, primarily as a result of our year-over-year growth in the portfolio. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operations of $192.4 million in the quarter, increased $50.8 million from comparable 2016 levels, primarily due to higher 2017 net earnings, $14.9 million of proceeds related to the settlement of a treasury lock, and changes in other operating activities, including $5 million of lower discretionary contributions to our U.S. pension plan to year-over-year. Net cash used by investing activities of $81.7 million included additions to finance receivables of $227 million, partially offset by collections of $173.8 million. Capital expenditures of $18.6 million in the quarter compared to $19.5 million last year. During the first quarter, we also acquired BTC Global Limited for $9.2 million, based in the United Kingdom, BTC designed an implements automotive vehicle inspection and management software for OEM franchise repair shops and has been included in the Repair Systems & Information Group. Net cash used by financing activities of $66.6 million included the January 2017 repayment of $150 million of notes at maturity and $135.7 million net decrease in other short-term borrowings. In the quarter, the company also received $297.8 million of net proceed from the February issuance of $300 million of 3.25% unsecured long-term notes. The proceeds of which were use to repay commercial paper borrowings with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes. Dividend payments to shareholders totaled $41.2 million in the quarter, and the company repurchase 210,000 shares of its common stock $35.8 million under its previously announced share repurchase programs. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $9.3 million from 2016 year-end levels, largely due to $8.4 million of foreign currency translation. Day sales outstanding 63 days was unchanged from year-end. Inventories increased $26.3 million from 2016 year-end, primarily in support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. Foreign currency translation contributed $8.5 million of the increase. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.3X were unchanged from 2016 year- end levels. Our quarter-end cash position of $123 million, increase $45.4 million from 2016 year-end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio of 24.7% compared with 26.3% to 2016 year-end. In addition to $123 million of cash, and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us access to the commercial paper markets. As of quarter-end, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, that\u2019s our first quarter. C&I with organic growth of 3%; OI margin, 13.9. SNA Europe, continuing its bellwether trends, sales up, profits up again industrial, critical industries coming back with broader gain. Tools up 2.5% organically, OI margin of 17.2%, up 60 basis points against the currency headwind of 70 basis points. RS&I Organic sales up 7.8% with increases across this customer base, each of its customer base. OI margin of 24.7% flat versus last year, but with RCI and volume offsetting 140 basis points of acquisition impact. It all added up to an overall organic growth of 4.1% and opco OI margin of 19.1% up 50 basis points against 50 basis points of impact from acquisitions. And an overall EPS of $2.39 up 10.6%, it was an encouraging quarter, achieved against headwinds and variation. And we believe as we\u2019ve said for some number of quarters that we\u2019re well positioned to continue that trend. Great new products are entering the mix, aimed at customer needs and customer excitement, all drivers of progress along our runways for growth. And Snap-on Value Creation continues to drive our runways for improvement. And now, we have new landscape for our acquisitions, providing expanded possibilities for further margin improvement. We believe we have abundant opportunity for both growth and improvement. And we believe we possess the capabilities and the intent to take full advantage and continue our positive trend going forward to 2017 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019d like to speak to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening. The encouraging quarter we\u2019re announcing today reflects unique skill and commitments. For all your many contributions to our progress, you have my congratulations. And for all your extraordinary dedication to our team, you have my thanks. Now turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instruction] We\u2019ll take our first question from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thanks good morning. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning Christopher Glynn : Yes, just with the Tools Group, you\u2019ve had some deceleration recently, but the comparisons were pretty tough in the first quarter, and it starts to get a little easier. So right now, you\u2019re a little bit below what I think you\u2019d call normalized. Is there a reversion that based on the comparisons that you expect? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look. We always say that we expect the 4% to 6% growth for our divisions and there could be variations from quarter-to-quarter. We never necessarily predict the reversion based on comparisons. This particular one was a difficult comparison that you said, I think the better thought is, look, we feel pretty confident about the new products we\u2019re rolling out. We\u2019re kind of pumped about the whole idea of the long handle ratchet and the new tool storage program and color and the excitement that will generate and the idea of the PT850 half inch impact, which is a signature tool, and everybody loves it. We like those. And so at the end of the day, it comes down to product, and we\u2019re kind of optimistic about that, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll say. Christopher Glynn : Okay, and then any update on franchisees, inventories and sell through against contracted sales to franchisees. Aldo Pagliari : No, I\u2019d say the \u2013 we\u2019re in line with franchisee movements more or less. There\u2019s always some variation in the inventory levels, but pretty much in line and reflective of our sales. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, and that moves from time to time. That goes quarter-to-quarter, the franchisee sales particularly match ours. It really depends on how we\u2019re feeling in the programs and so on. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then with the originations and sort of a flattening trend, but portfolio continues to grow, can you talk about any trend of restructuring or re-aging the loans and how you view that? Aldo Pagliari : We don\u2019t restructure the loans. I mean, the loans stand by themselves and the originations, I think, largely reflect the pattern of what\u2019s being demanded in that channel and as Nick has mentioned earlier, our tool storage, which is the most popular product to be originated on the contract was not as robust the quarter in that regard. Christopher Glynn : Okay, great. And then just, do you have any data on the net charge-offs and the ending allowance? Aldo Pagliari : Yes, they were up slightly. If you look at it year-over-year, but stable and actually on a sequential basis, we saw a bit of improvement over all. So again, somewhat stable trends in line what our expectations. Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Christopher Glynn : Okay thanks guys Aldo Pagliari : Sure Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, Nick. A lot of good things this quarter. I wanted to just \u2013 I wanted to ask you about the storage and I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s going on there with your assessment of the negative growth in storage. Is this demand easing? curtailed to credit availability with respect to this category? Nick Pinchuk : No, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of that. Sorry, I don\u2019t think actually, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any of that. I mean, there always can be factors, from time to time. My assessment is first of all, tool storage has been growing a longtime. This quarter even though with the down, it\u2019s one of our top 10 quarters ever still in tool storage. But having said that, now we\u2019ve had two quarters of tool storage less than robust positioning, and we conclude, maybe it needs a little more excitement, maybe \u2013 at the end of the day, these are product-driven. And you roll out a product and some \u2013 if some of them are singles and doubles and some are home runs. And when we look at the tool storage in general, you might be tempted to say that we look at the tool storage offering across the network. It\u2019s down in 4 to 5 places where we have vans, and they aren\u2019t affected by any of those things that you\u2019re talking about, if you observe those markets over the years, they wouldn\u2019t be affected by, let\u2019s say, credit or so much by credit or by saturation. And so we conclude the tool storage line up just need a little goosing. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m talking about this new program rolling out, new colors and so on. It\u2019s as simple as that, I think. David MacGregor : As there been any change in the number of Rock \u2018N Roll Cap Expresses on the road? Nick Pinchuk : No, we haven\u2019t change them. So that\u2019s another thought. I mean \u2013 but we \u2013 I tend to think it\u2019s for our \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 this tends to be \u2013 there is a lot of factors, David. And of course, everything I say isn\u2019t true everywhere. But the thing is, I think if you look across the networking and you see the behavior of tool storage and when it happens for two \u2013 for more than one quarter, it starts to get your attention. We say, \"Hey, let\u2019s accelerate a little goosing.\" And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. And so I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve encoded in the tool storage situation. It\u2019s not been ticked because diagnostics is rolling. Diagnostics is having a great quarter, had a great quarter, another great quarter. So that isn\u2019t it. It isn\u2019t the big ticket situation, just \u2013 and you see it from time to time. It doesn\u2019t show up so clearly, but when we look at it at a granular level, we see positives and singles and doubles and triples. David MacGregor : I want to ask you about the acquisitions because hit you finally you got a lot of margin up side there, I guess I was going to ask you if you could just quantify your best guess on what the margin upside is? Do these acquisitions get back to kind fled average margins? Or could they surpass that? What\u2019s the upside? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I don\u2019t really want to speculate on that. All I know is we ought to moving them upwards. You\u2019ve got a year where they come in. You kind of have a year where they start to \u2013 their comparing to the year before where they weren\u2019t in the number, but then after that given you Snap-on Value Creation and so on, you expect to have that effect, start moving them upwards. And I don\u2019t know where the upside is I mean you got Car-O-Liner is there which is a kind of equipment level business, which is at the bottom of RS&I\u2019s \u2013 OI margin. Remember, RS&I is a variance of several thousand basis points. And so OI margins and equipment is at a sort of bottom end of that because it\u2019s hardware-based. And Car-O-Liner starts out a little bit lower than that. We think we got a lot of upside in those businesses. And so \u2013 but I wouldn\u2019t want to quantify it. I am just happy to get a good chunk every year. David MacGregor : Did I hear you correctly? Nick Pinchuk : No limits to the upside. David MacGregor : Did I hear you correctly that it takes about a year to integrate but that for a year you \u2013 they should not be\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t mean integrate. I don\u2019t mean integrate. I just mean that\u2019s the arithmetic. In other words, if you have a lower margin business and you\u2019re comparing to the year, the year before, you don\u2019t have it in your numbers in the year before. So it stands out like a sore thumb. It\u2019s a variance. And then when you \u2013 so you don\u2019t \u2013 it might be less impact for the next quarter even if it gets better and less impactful, but it\u2019s still going to be dilutive for a couple of quarters. But then, you start to have comparisons where it\u2019s in the base, and you see your improvements standout visibly still that mean. David MacGregor : Yes, absolutely. You got a very good free cash flow storage your acquisitions become a more predominant part of the growth as we go forward from here? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re going to acquire along our runways for growth, and we have a sort of a list of acquisitions we\u2019re reviewing constantly. I think acquisitions \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think they\u2019re going to become more a greater part of the growth, but we\u2019re constantly reviewing them and you can see us take advantage when the opportunities are there. David MacGregor : Last question is just, how do you promote growth of a second associate on the truck, when all those trucks where you do have a second associates, it seems like your getting superior growth to those that don\u2019t have it. How do you incent your franchisees? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think it\u2019s stuff like \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we do two things, one is we try to make sure that there\u2019s a sharing of best practices is that at colloquial meaning like the kickoffs, like the NFAC people are representatives, and they\u2019ll go back and share it with their regions. And then of course, at the SFC, the Snap-on franchisee conference were pretty much all of them come, we try to make sure we trumpet the effects of those things and talk about and provide seminars on how to select and manage those people. And also, on our own, we try to provide packages that will support them. They\u2019re not our employees, and we don\u2019t urge these \u2013 it\u2019s a situation. It\u2019s important to say, \u201cThis is not our program.\" But we provide the support programs that make it possible. David MacGregor : Got it. Thanks, Nick Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Liam Burke : Yes good morning Nick. Good morning Aldo. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Liam. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Liam Burke : Nick you\u2019ve put a lot of upfront investments in emerging markets in the C&I business. You highlighted the fact that in the \u2013 India and China are doing well. Are you starting to see any kind of positive operating return of those upfront investments? Nick Pinchuk : Well, they\u2019re profitable, but we keep investing. So I mean, the thing is, the balance is still about where it\u2019s always been, so we don\u2019t necessarily see \u2013 I don\u2019t see a time where we\u2019re going to see huge upside coming there. Because we still see opportunities. So in terms of top end, so we keep trying to reposition ourselves in terms of blue point stores, for example. We had another one this quarter as part of the C&I expense category. And so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing a boost out of them in terms of the financials yet. This is just our view that they\u2019re going to give us returns, and our approach is still, Liam, that we want to build the physicals, because we have confidence that as that wave comes and it starts to come, it starts to come, we\u2019re going to see returns. But we don\u2019t view it as a huge profit opportunity in the near-term, more or less as a positioning opportunity. Liam Burke : Great, thanks, Nick. And Aldo, on the cash flows, just touching the return in there. Even when I\u2019m adjusting for some of the onetimes, your cash flow is starting to grow, it\u2019s starting to accelerate. Beyond the acquisitions, where is the priority for cash allocation going to be? Nick Pinchuk : Well, the first priority still always remains serving our organic growth. So we\u2019re not afraid to make investments. We talked a little bit about that in the C&I segment. But when there\u2019s opportunities to invest internally, we\u2019re willing to do that as well. And of course, Snap-on credit still is growing. That\u2019s been the use of our cash to some extent, and then as Nick mentioned already, support of acquisitions. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Aldo. Aldo Pagliari : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Stember with C.L. King & Associates. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Scott Stember : Can you maybe talk about some of the new programs or the new tools and products you talked about in the Tools Group? Really, just talking about the new tools, the new cabinet program, new colors. Is there anything else to this new program outside of color? And maybe just talk about the timing of when these new products will touch showing up in your numbers. Nick Pinchuk : Well, we\u2019re talking about sort of the beginning and sort of like as we go forward into the second quarter and you\u2019re talking about trim as well as programs that wrap around it, so you have kind of programs that try to make sure that people focus on it as well. And so those things are what wraps around the kind of thing. It has to do with, one an attraction that gives someone a reason to buy. This is what we say in the Tools Group. There are \u2013 they\u2019re ongoing types of programs, a lot of programs that roll through this, but we\u2019re talking about it\u2019s aimed at the Tools Group, aimed at a new product that\u2019s going to get peoples\u2019 attention. And we wrap merchandising program around this and promotion program around this and maybe throw in some sort of hat or something like that, that gets people. So you give people a reason to pay attention to it. And we think when they pay attention to it, they see those colors with that trim, with the features that are available, this becomes a seller. And the Algona plant has, I think, an incredible amount of different options that can added on to this kind of thing. So we feel pretty good about it. It\u2019s a new \u2013 like I said, it\u2019s a new set of \u2013 it\u2019s a new appearance that people won\u2019t have seen before, and we think that drives excitement. One of the things that does, if you\u2019re in a garage and a guy\u2019s got a box, you like the appearance of a different box. You like some of the features of a different box. He wants trade out because he wants to get attention in his ward. This is what generates the activity. Scott Stember : Got it. And then the RS&I side, you\u2019re starting to see some continued growth here in the \u2013 with the new car, the OEM dealers. Can you maybe just talk about what you\u2019re seeing there? Are they sustainable trends. And the high single-digit growth that we\u2019re seeing in this segment, if this is something that can persists throughout the year? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t know. Look, I think these are program-related. So that particular segments of the business with OEM dealerships tends to be more lumpy than others, because you get a program. And sometimes, that program lasts for 3 quarters and it runs out and you don\u2019t hook onto another program till you get out to the fifth quarter. So there\u2019s a gap quarter in there. That\u2019s \u2013 if you listen to these calls enough, you hear me talk about that stuff. But what I am encouraged about this time is, we have vehicle OEMs. We have heavy-duty OEM\u2019s. We have heavy-duty OEMs. We have agriculture OEMs doing this. So it\u2019s a kind of broad view of repair. We haven\u2019t seen that so much come together. So it\u2019s kind of positive in that regard. Now I can\u2019t testify that these are going to continue, because as I said, this tends to be a lumpy portion of our business. But the fact that it\u2019s spread across 3 different places, pretty good. Scott Stember : All right, and last question on currency. Brexit happened, I believe, in the end of the second quarter last year. Is this still a good assumption that in the back half of the year, we should expect the currency comparison to ease? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, although the second quarter, we think \u2013 look, we state today, if the currency stays the way it is today, the second quarter will be somewhat tougher from a currency point of view because the other currencies were stronger in the second quarter then they deteriorated. But you\u2019re right in terms of \u2013 it gets \u2013 the comparisons get easier as it flows out. So what we would \u2013 again, it will probably \u2013 the chance it stands right where it is today is probably low, but if did, we see some rise in currency difficulty going forward to the second quarter and then abatement in the third and fourth quarter. Scott Stember : Got it, that\u2019s all I have. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Tom Hayes with Northcoast Research. Tom Hayes : Hi thanks, good morning gentlemen. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Tom Hayes : Just wondering if we could dig into the C&I segment just a little bit. Last year, we were talking about three of the end markets : energy, military and avionics. Certainly a bit of challenge in 2016. Just want to see kind of what your thoughts are coming out of Q1 and for the balance of the year for those three segments? Nick Pinchuk : Actually, I\u2019m pretty encouraged. C&I is a big place for us. We got SNA Europe, which I just \u2013 if you\u2019re going to talk about C&I, SNA Europe is a bellwether. That thing has become a monster. It\u2019s growing 14 quarters in sales and 16 quarters in profits. And Europe, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed lately, isn\u2019t the most certain of places, so it\u2019s done pretty well. But if you want to go to critical industries, like I think you\u2019re referring to, which is about 1/3 of the business in C&I, we did focus on military and national resources and aviation. And natural resources came back for us. And what I like about this quarter is, it is about the same growth in the critical industries as past quarters. Although sequentially, it looks pretty positive, but also, it\u2019s a little bit more broadly based. Last quarter, we had growth, but there are more eggs in the military basket, the military got better by wider \u2013 by a pretty wide margin last quarter, and that delivered the critical industry\u2019s basket for us. This time, we have gains in natural resources in places like wind and mining and places like that oil and gas, and gains in heavy-duty and gains in general industry, a little more broadly based. Military is more tepid. In fact, it\u2019s down a little bit this quarter, difficult to predict where military has gone quarter-to-quarter. I said that for a dog\u2019s age on these calls. And then aviation still isn\u2019t solved because for us, the Middle East, the international aviation business is kind of on its back because a lot of that business came out of the Middle East and it isn\u2019t working for us right now. So you\u2019re going to see some kind of recovery outside. You got military, which is chronically variable, and the rest of them are kind of recovering. Aviation, we still haven\u2019t quite solved yet. So think positive, positive. I\u2019m really encouraged. Tom Hayes : Okay. And then Aldo, you start on the financial services piece. I think you kind of covered a little bit. I just want to make sure I understood the components. You said that EBIT margin go down year-over-year from about 70.9 to 68.4. I think you called out it was manpower and additional write-offs. Was that kind of the driver of the change there? Aldo Pagliari : You\u2019re talking about financial services? Tom Hayes : Yes. Aldo Pagliari : Yes. No, financial services are certainly these higher provisions for receivables over the last couple of quarters. We had that phenomenon in Q4. All I\u2019m saying is that if you look year-over-year your provisioning is higher, I will be at a little bit less than what we had done in Q4 and you\u2019re seeing a little bit of progress on the 60 plus day delinquency indicator. Tom Hayes : Did you also mentioned, I thought you mentioned in your prepared remarks. You \u2013 Do you add manpower to the financial services business? Aldo Pagliari : Yes. Little bit of additional\u2026 Tom Hayes : Okay. Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Joe Vruwink : This is Joe Vruwink for David. Nick. Pinchuk: Yes, Joe Joe Vruwink : Can you maybe comment on growth trends in the tools channel as the quarter progressed? And I\u2019d be interested in whether these tax refund delays maybe impacted February at all, and do you start to see activity come back in March as refunds came back? Nick. Pinchuk: No, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t \u2013 we didn\u2019t see the tax refund delays. We didn\u2019t hear anything like that. Generally, the week-by-week or month-by-month trends in our quarters don\u2019t really mean much. We have quite a bit of variation. It\u2019s sort of like quarter-to-quarter \u2013 quarterly variation in the month. So it really doesn\u2019t mean so much. What I will tell you though is that I met just \u2013 we had \u2013 we box part this quarter. In the beginning, like middle of January, we met with the franchisees as they were booming. And then at the end of the quarter, a couple of weeks ago, I met with the franchise \u2013 the National Franchise Council for the U.S. they were really enthusiastic. So at least from the windshield surveys, I felt pretty good about it. The numbers are what they are. I still think the growth was \u2013 it was fairly positive for a retail business. But again, we had \u2013 and we had \u2013 so we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the market. The market is very positive for us, we think. Joe Vruwink : So when I look at your loan origination growth and let\u2019s say that\u2019s flat, therefore big ticket sales are flattish to do 3% organic growth, and tools implies the core hand tool category, which is obviously the majority of what you\u2019re selling is maybe mid-single-digit growth directionally. Nick Pinchuk : Look, first of all, let\u2019s talk about \u2013 let\u2019s talk a little bit about big ticket. Big ticket, you got diagnostics up. What drives the originations is big ticket. But there\u2019s a new kind of wrinkle in this, and that is the thermal imager in diagnostics. This is a smaller-end diagnostic in effect like in the $1000 range. And what has been in diagnostics almost uniformly being financed is being \u2013 by the credit companies is being \u2013 some of that is being financed by their franchisees, because now they are strong enough to finance something like that. So that\u2019s part of what\u2019s going on in the originations activity. And there are other categories besides hand tools. There\u2019s power tool, there are some other stuff, which we call shop and tech and so on. So I don\u2019t think you can make just that view of the world. You can \u2013 you could kind of step back and make it. But you can\u2019t just look at originations in this case and say that big ticket is completely flat, because you have that thermal imager in there this time, which makes it different. Joe Vruwink : So I guess \u2013 yes, so this is what I\u2019m trying to get at. The industry, it seems to be growing at a mid-single digit pace. When you listen to your peers talk about their growth, seems to be mid- single. And when I look at Snap-on and consider that a lot of the products that have seen strong growth this cycle that are tied to originations, those have flattened out. If I look at the other stuff in the Snap-on portfolio, it would seem to be growing mid-single, so at the end of the day Snap-On still growing in line with its market. It\u2019s just we\u2019re weathering these comparisons right now where you have a particular big ticket category you called out tool storage, that is just going through a bit of a soft patch. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, there\u2019s some of that. That\u2019s directionally probably correct. I think our big message here today is, we think the market is pretty good. Joe Vruwink : Yes. Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Bret Jordan : On the corporate expense, the 21 and change, that\u2019s pretty well-controlled. I think a year or two ago, you talked about it sort of being $100 million annual run rate. Should we think about that being more along the lines of 20? Or was that $5 million lower pension contribution the driver to the low level. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Look, I think \u2013 the way I would say it is, I think we spent something \u2013 let me think. I think we spent about $94 million last year in the corporate expense. I think you could say it\u2019s going to be in that ballpark, maybe uplifting it slightly. That\u2019s the kind of number I would expect. These things ebb and flow back and forth from quarter-to-quarter, so I would model it in that range, if I were you. Bret Jordan : So the $5 million lower pension contribution was sort of just a timing issue around the first quarter. Aldo Pagliari : No. Just to clarify. It\u2019s Aldo. The pension contribution doesn\u2019t really impact expense directly in the short run. Pension is relatively flat year-over-year. That\u2019s just the contribution goes to the pension plan. So that\u2019s not a direct cause and effect. So if you look at corporate expenses, they\u2019re kind of flattish really the last year in Q1. Pension is up so slightly over year-over-year. So I\u2019d say, you\u2019re trending directionally to be, as Nick said, $95 million to $100 million range is still for modeling purposes, not unreasonable. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question, I guess \u2013 I\u2019m sure the franchisees are communicating with their customers daily. Is tool storage, is that \u2013 I mean, obviously, it\u2019s more of a discretionary transaction versus diagnostics where you need the current technology to complete the job. Is there an issue there that this is sort of an indicator of mechanic sentiment? Or is it just that there\u2019s nothing new enough and the channels just spur them to buy again. Nick Pinchuk : Look, I think it\u2019s always the case. You can bring out a new power tool or a new diagnostic threat and it can be, let\u2019s say, double as my \u2013 by baseball analogy instead of a home run. I\u2019m not saying that our offering is tremendously better. It\u2019s \u2013 we think it\u2019s strong, but it may not be as compelling as it was the last iteration. It may not be the home run. That\u2019s a difference. I do think you\u2019re right in that tool storage is a little more emotional. You look at that box, you say, \"I remember being on an event once. A guy came at a fair, where this guy said, hey, did you see that white box with a sapphire trim? I really love it. I think I\u2019ve got to buy it.\" He was so excited by just the appearance of the box. So that is the fact in this kind of thing. It\u2019s not a saturation thing. Bret Jordan : What\u2019s the color that\u2019s coming out? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m allowed to reveal that, actually, but Bret\u2026 Bret Jordan : I mean, I\u2019m going to wait to buy my Snap-on box if I see the new color of that. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, you\u2019re right, right. Bret Jordan : On average yield and it\u2019s up 10 basis points, I mean, I think it was a year ago this quarter we talked about some of the platinum franchisees allowed to be more flexible I think in their decision, their credit decisions. Is yield up because we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve change the borrowing base a little bit? Or is that yield just up because we have seen some interest rate increase year-over-year? Aldo Pagliari : Look, I think it\u2019s more reflective of the actual credit profile, what we\u2019re doing the underwriting on. And as I said, it\u2019s actually down 20 basis points from last quarter. So 18%, 17.9% is kind of the natural range that settles in that, so there really hasn\u2019t been a lot of movements on yields of over the recent turn. Bret Jordan : Okay. All right, great. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Robert \u2013 or excuse me, Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Richard Hilgert : Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, everybody. Just curious with the administration talking about tax reduction. I\u2019ve noticed your tax \u2013 effective tax rate consistently runs about 5 percentage points below the corporate average. If we were to see a reduction from the corporate rate of 35%, down to a 25% number, would your effective tax rate move the same amount or \u2013 are there anything \u2013 any things in your taxes that would change that ratio? Would it be less of a change? More of a change? Aldo Pagliari : Well, first off, Richard, when you look at the overall rate of 31%, you have to remember, we\u2019re about 80% influenced by the United States, 20% influenced by \u2013 let\u2019s say the outside world\u2019s tax rates. So you\u2019re right. If you go back to the 35% statutory federal rate Snap-on takes advantage of probably around 250, a little bit more, slightly more than that of deductions, such as the manufacturing deduction, the R&D tax credit, things of that nature. So if you took a step back and look strictly at U.S. taxes as written today, you\u2019d say, \"Well, we\u2019re in the 33% range, maybe the 32.5% range.\" So in theory, if a statutory rate is reduced from 35% to something less than 30%, Snap-on should actually stand to benefit on the U.S. effective tax rate. As you know though, these are pretty complicated items being discussed, so you see the actual rollout of the tax law, it\u2019s really hard to opine on what the impact will be. Richard Hilgert : Understood. Just for clarification, on the C&I group, Nick, you\u2019re saying military was a slight headwind, aviation was a headwind, but natural resources were positive. The European region was positive, doing very well. Is that the correct summary? Nick Pinchuk : That\u2019s correct. Richard Hilgert : Okay, great. And then I was curious, with the way that the growth rates have been going in RS&I, and you were mentioning some of the dynamics of the big ticket items. Could you maybe describe the growth rates there, more in terms of what\u2019s been your experience with respect to the overall pricing in that group versus the overall volume in that group? And how much does each one affect the growth rate. Nick Pinchuk : Wow. I don\u2019t know. I mean, the thing is, look, all I can say is, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have pricing generally as one of our line items in explanation. We don\u2019t see much motion in pricing. And so generally, when we \u2013 and at both ways, when we price, we tend to do it around the new model which we set the value proposition and therefore, the prices get reset. We don\u2019t like to reduce our prices to get volume, and so we resist that. And we do so in equipment. And so from time to time, it can happen. But in general, you are not seeing us knock down the prices. And if you doubt that, remember what I said, 24.7% OI margin against 140 basis points negative year-over-year impact from acquisitions, that means something \u2013 happen that was worth of 140 basis points. Richard Hilgert : Right. And you mentioned one item that you thought would be on the hit parade this year in the hand tools group. Given the kind of tapering off there, the last couple of quarters, your \u2013 what you said about your hit parade in years past is that you\u2019ve got $1 million per year coming in from the hit parade from the new items that are going out, has that kind of tapered off in the last couple of quarters and then we can expect to see more of that kind of come back a little bit above that? Or how has that all playing out right now? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t know. What we actually measure, Richard, is the number of million-dollar products, not the amount. So you can have Transformers, and you can have some other small \u2013 you can have the Jack Reacher, both of which make some money but aren\u2019t necessarily a lot \u2013 are quite different in terms of the amount of money they\u2019ll have. Transformers is a huge blockbuster, Jack Reacher made some money so that kind of thing, and so that what\u2019s happening in these things. Maybe a fewer the hit products didn\u2019t make us much, maybe a few of tool storage that\u2019s came out didn\u2019t sell quite a much, and they still were hit products. What I\u2019m talking about in this particular one is, is that, that\u2019s going to be hit product. We say it\u2019s going to sell a lot more than that particular one. It will sell a lot more than $1 million. Our numbers of hit products though have continue to be pretty good, so they\u2019re not really abating. It\u2019s just the amount that are being associated with it. And hit products aren\u2019t the whole thing, it is that the hit products that drive everything. Hit products drive the excitement through the whole bunch of non-hit products that are driving excitement some of which are former hit products that are older. So it\u2019s a more complex \u2013 the revenue add up is a more complex thing. I don\u2019t think you can look at a trend in the big new success \u2013 difference really. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Leslie. Please go ahead. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks, Lauren. We appreciate everyone for joining today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we appreciate your interest in the company. Thanks.

With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start the call with some highlights of our second quarter. I\u2019ll speak about the general environment, the trends we see, some of the headwinds we\u2019ve encountered and the progress we\u2019ve made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financial. On an overall basis, our second quarter was encouraging, we believe that once again offered evidence of advancement along our runways for both growth and for improvement. Reported sales were up 5.6% to $921.4 million and that included unfavorable foreign currency translation this quarter an impact of $12.5 million. It also reflected an incremental $38.4 million from acquisition last years Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont operations and this year is BTC and Norbar business. Our organic sales for the quarter rose 2.7% with varying increases recorded by every group. The opco operating margin reached 19.9% up from 19.1% in 2016, and that 80 basis point increase reflects the higher sales but it also represents the power of Snap-on value creation to driver earnings growth. For financial services operating income grew to $54.6 million from last year\u2019s $49.5 million, combining with opco to offer our consolidated operating margin of 23.9%, up 100 basis point. Our earnings per share they reached $2.60, up from the $2.36 of last year a rise of 10.2%. Those are the numbers. Now for the market, from an overall macro perspective, we do believe the automotive repair arena remains favorable. The Tools Group organic activity was up slightly, smaller again then the previous period. That said, we don\u2019t believe the second quarter results indicate a softening marketplace. We\u2019re not hearing or seeing that rather it reflects the specific headwinds like sales decrease around our tool storage product line. On the other side of automotive, our automotive repair operations RS&I had strong volume in the second quarter. Organic sales growth with both independent repair shop owners and managers and with OEM dealerships, this marks RS&I\u2019s third straight quarter of high single digit progress in organic sales. Representing what we believe to be an affirmation of the positive auto repair environment. Now for the Commercial & Industrial Group or C&I, organic sales were up mid single digit the highest for some time with progress across most of the industrial sectors and geographies and critical industries, gains posted in nearly every second \u2013 segment. Both in the U.S. and internationally, strengthen sectors like natural resources, heavy duty fleet, and particular progress in places like the UK and Mexico. Also positive for C&I was SNA Europe. SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering another quarter of solid results in places like Spain, France, Denmark and Sweden more gains across the core of Europe. So overall the results remain favorable. Growth was slim in the Tools Group, but advancements with auto repair shops was strong in RS&I. There was a clear recovery in critical industries, and there were continued gains in Europe. Opportunities still outweighing the challenges and the sales growth confirms it, and the operating income demonstrated \u2013 they demonstrated once again, the leverage and the power of Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. Innovation and customer connection, the principles that guiding our organization in the ongoing development of productivity solution, borne out of the insights and observations gathered out of customers workplace and together with RCI once again this quarter helping to drive an 80 basis point OI margin gain. Well that\u2019s the sort of macro overview. Now let\u2019s move to the groups. Let\u2019s start with tools. Organic sales were up 0.5%, there were two primary drivers that attenuating tool activity tool storage sales and destock. Tool storage was simply not the ever upward spring it\u2019s been in the past. We believe there are still abundant market opportunity the segment isn\u2019t saturated, however, our product line it wasn\u2019t as compelling as we\u2019ve had in recent periods. The second quarter enhancements we tried, they were somewhat but they weren\u2019t enough, we need to do more in the upcoming Snap-on franchisee conference will be the initial venue for around of that new product. Also it appears that the Rock \u2018N Roll Cabs are special tool storage vans, have lost some of their excitement. We\u2019ll have to retool them. We\u2019ll have to retool them to get the customer attention, and we will. And finally we regularly refine our credit programs to match franchisee practice and performance, this time we re-stripped our credit platinum levels and that change had some initial effect on tool storage. So we saw a weaker tool storage activity in both our sales and in the franchisees volume the sales off the truck. We\u2019re aiming to recover with new product and with a revitalized set of Rock \u2018N Roll vans. The other product line, our tool storage. Sales off the van, sales from the franchisees to technicians are up nicely for products besides tool storage, they were near the top of our targeted rates. Our sales of those product, that is the Tools Group sales of those products to franchisees were mixed and tepid in total. It appears that the traditional de-stocking that proceeds the buying opportunities of the Snap-on franchisee conference SFC and always take place in July and early August, well that contraction crap into part of June. The franchisees were selling robustly off the van with those products but drawing down their positions and ordering less new product. The reason that that these have been bigger than ever, offering more exciting products. Franchisees have been ordering more in that one being weekend and this year, we\u2019re getting ready earlier clearing the decks. That\u2019s said, even with a modest volume increase Tools Group operating margins rose 120 basis points to 19.5%. That 120 basis point improvement demonstrates clear progress to benefit the Snap-on value creation, more effective higher margin product, streamline product development and nice volume leverage internationally. Advancements in the Tools Group are evident in the overall OI improvement, and they are apparent in our franchisee health metrics. The financial and physical indicators we monitor and evaluate continuously. They remain favorable an important categories like franchisee turnover. We believe our van network is growing stronger, I just visited several franchisees in the field and I can assure you that the confidence of those entrepreneurs was quite encouraging and besides those interactions during more formal discussions like our National Franchisee Advisory Council meetings, I heard similar comments. The people I spoke to are upbeat very confident of their opportunity going forward, that\u2019s the Tools Group. Now onto C&I. A 4.7% organic sales rise with higher critical industry activity and increased volumes at SNA Europe and at our Asia-Pacific operations. For several quarters now the C&I businesses have demonstrated sales acceleration. C&I operating margin was 13.8% flat versus 2016 with volume and RCI gains being more or less to offset by the impact of our recent acquisition. Importantly, the industrial division showed strength, broad \u2013 showed strong broad-based progress across the critical industries with most of those sectors advancing in the quarter. We believe the improving macroeconomic conditions coupled with our array of great new products and that\u2019s solving critical path is driving those favorable results. Speaking of new products in the C&I Group, in the quarter C&I acquired Norbar Torque Tools headquartered in the UK, Norbar is a leading manufacturer of torque product offering a full range of wrenches, multipliers and calibrator that acquisition complements and expands our existing torque line by extending our range up all the way to 220,000 foot panels, more for the C&I team to sell to our customers and critical industries. Norbar offers both power torque and strong line up of manual torque multipliers. The latest in that line introduced in the second quarter is the MTMB740 compact manual torque multiplier, this tool, it features compact design with a multiplier head just 2.6 inches in diameter enabling excellent access and easy handling, while still providing 5 :1 multiplication ratio up to 740-foot panels, and that\u2019s Norbar tradition the construction is robust delivering a long life and minimal maintenance and its ideal for using tough environments like oil and gas, mining, power generation, railroad and heavy duty fleets in a range of critical industries. Now C&I has been in Torque for sometime, with our manufacturing facilities in City of Industry, California more recently with our Sturtevant Richmont acquisition and Carol Stream, Illinois producing great products, selling to automotive, aerospace and other industrial customers. And in the second quarter, our City of Industry team launched it\u2019s ATech micro TechAngle quarter inch drive torque wrench, the smallest electronic torque wrench in the market, compact steel body, less than a foot in length and less than an inch in diameter and it weighed just under a pound. That compares with our \u2013 by comparison to our standard ATech quarter inch wrench, at 16.5 inches in length and 1.9 inches in diameter and weighing nearly 2 pound. Engine compartments they continue to get smaller and tighter with each model year limiting the access and reducing the workspace. The slim design of our new ATech allows technicians to reach fasteners that are resource obstructed, reducing the need to remove components and saving considerable time in the repair shop. And the products short overall length enables a compact swingarm. That\u2019s very important in a tight space of modern machinery. We\u2019re excited about the compact quarter inch ATech access and accuracy in one package, we believe it\u2019s a clear winner and early results support that view. Now let\u2019s speak about SNA Europe, positive trends and the uncertainty that is Europe. SNA Europe registered it\u2019s 15th straight quarter of year-over-year sales growth and profit quarter to mark the 17th straight quarter of margin improvement defining the challenges over multiple geographies roughly four straight years of favorable performance, helping the C&I Group advance in both sales and profitability. And in the quarter Asia-Pacific operations, sales growth in countries like China and Taiwan lower volume in places like India, mixed results by country but positive result overall. C&I, turning in a promising quarter on broad gains and accelerating sales. Now onto RS&I, organic sales rose 8.3%, high single digit gains of diagnostic and repair information products, the independent repair shop owners and managers a high single digit increase with OEM dealerships and a mid single digit in advanced in undercar equipment, growth across the board. And on a reported basis, including RS&I\u2019s $22.5 million of acquisition related sales volume grew 14.5% in the second quarter. Operating earnings of $81.9 million increased $7.4 million. The operating margin of 24.2% was down 100 basis points but that was impacted by 120 basis points of lower margin in the acquisition. The broad organic growth was strong with independent and with dealerships. And innovation and new product paved the way. From the diagnostics division, our newest handheld offering ETHOS Edge enhanced industrial design, faster response time, configure to match specifically the needs of new tech, those just starting out and working on a more routine maintenance test and light repair. The initial feedback on the ETHOS Edge is quite enthusiastic and early sales they\u2019ve exceeded our expectation. For the OEM dealership, in the quarter RS&I introduced a new \u2013 latest version of the next brand Electronic Data Link or EDL3, it is specifically designed for the needs of agricultural repair technicians across the service network of a large OEM. This essential tool responded to a need to connect ag equipment in the field to the OEM\u2019s diagnostic software, to access repair information in any environment Snap-on solve the problem and made it happen. The EDL3 is just one example of our essential diagnostic program aimed at OEM dealerships, and those were nice part of RS&I\u2019s quarter. And undercar equipment, it was also up, mid single digit with particular strength internationally, solid growth in Europe and broad gains in lifts and balances, undercar equipment another positive quarter. So to wrap up RS&I, substantial achievement across the division, improving our position with repair shop owners and mangers continuing a very favorable trend. So that\u2019s the highlights of our quarter. Tools Group lagging in sales but C&I and RS&I both recorded strong performance progress along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancement than our runways for improving. Overall sales increasing organically 2.7%, opco operating income margin of 19.9% up 80 basis points. EPS $2.60 arise of 10.2%. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $921.4 million in the quarter increased $49.1 million or 5.6% from 2016 levels, reflecting a $23.2 million or 2.7% organic sales gain, $38.4 million of acquisition related sale and $12.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Foreign currency movements adversely impacted our Q2 sales comparisons by 150 basis points. The organic sales gain reflects ongoing progress in serving the vehicle repair sector as well as more broad based sales growth to industrial market segments in our C&I Group and more than we\u2019ve seen in sometime. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to the benefits from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effect. Operating expenses of $279.3 million yielded an operating expense margin of 30.3% in the quarter unchanged from year ago and sales volume leverage and other benefits were offset by 70 basis points of operating expenses or acquisition. As a result of these factors, operating earnings before financial services of $183.7 million, increased 10.4% and improved 80 basis points to 19.9%, despite the 70 basis point impact from acquisition and 20 basis point of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Financial services revenue of $77.7 million increased $8.4 million from 2016 levels, and operating earnings of $54.6 million, including $0.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $5.1 million. Consolidated operating earnings of $238.3 million, including $4.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 10.4%, and the operating margin of 23.9% improved 100 basis points from 22.9% a year ago. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 30.6% compared to 31.0% last year. Finally, net earnings of $153.2 million, or $2.60 per diluted share increased $13.1 million, or $0.24 per share from 2016 levels, representing a 10.2% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $310.0 million in the quarter, increased $24.3 million, or 8.5%, reflecting a $13.3 million, or 4.7% organic sales gain, $15.9 million of acquisition-related sales, and $4.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase primarily includes a high single-digit gain in the segment\u2019s European-based hand tools business, and a mid single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries, which was generally wide ranging across the industrial end markets that we serve. Gross profit at C&I Group of $120.8 million compared to $111.4 million last year and gross margin was 39% in both years. Operating expenses of $78.1 million in the quarter compared to $72.1 million last year. The operating expense margin of 25.2% was same in both years, primarily due to sales volume leverage, offset by increased costs, including higher cost for research and engineering activity, and 30 basis points of operating expenses for acquisition. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the C&I segment of $42.7 million increased $3.4 million from 2016 levels, and the operating margin was 13.8% in both the second quarters of 2017 and 2016. Turning now to Slide 8. Second quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $413.8 million decreased $2.9 million, or 0.7%, reflecting $2.1 million, or 0.5% organic sales gain and $5.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a double-digit gain in the international franchise operations, largely offset by a low single-digit decrease in the U.S franchise operation. Gross profit of $183.6 million in the quarter compared to $182.1 million last year. Gross margin of 44.4% improved 70 basis points, primarily due to benefits from sales of higher growth margin product and savings from our RCI initiative, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effect. Operating expenses of $103 million in the quarter, compared to $105.8 million last year. The operating expense margin of 24.9% improved 50 basis points, primarily due to sales volume leverage in the international franchise operations. As a result of these factors, operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $80.6 million, including $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $4.3 million and the operating margin of 19.5% improved 120 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Second quarter sales of $338.1 million increased $42.9 million, or 14.5%, reflecting a $24.1 million, or 8.3%, organic sales gain, $22.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase was again comprehensive this quarter, reflecting high single-digit gains in sales OEM dealerships and in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, as well as a mid single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment. Gross profit of $158.6 million in the quarter compared to $137.8 million last year. And the gross margin of 46.9% improved 20 basis points. As a result of 80 basis points of benefit from acquisitions, partially offset by a shift in sales that included higher volumes of lower gross margin product. Operating expenses of $76.7 million in the quarter, compared to $63.3 million last year. The operating expense margin of 22.7% increased 120 basis points, principally due to 200 basis points of unfavorable impact from acquisitions, partially offset by benefits from sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $81.9 million, including $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased $7.4 million from prior year level. The operating margin of 24.2% decreased 100 basis points, including a 120 basis points impact from acquisition. Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $54.6 million on revenue of $77.7 million, compared to operating earnings of $49.5 million on revenue of $69.3 million last year. Financial services expenses of $23.1 million increase $3.3 million, primarily due to changes in the size of the portfolio and an increase in the provisions for credit losses. While total provision expense of $13.4 million in the second quarter is up, $2.9 million year-over-year, it decreased slightly from $14.3 million incurred in Q1. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.2% in both the second quarters of 2017 and 2016. In the both the second quarters of 2017 and 2016, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.9%. The respected average yield on contract receivables was 9.1% and 9.3%. Total loan originations of $270.6 million in the second quarter decreased $10.4 million, or 3.7% year-over-year, due primarily to a $12.4 million, or 5.1% decline in the finance receivables originations, resulting principally from lower year-over-year tool storage sales by the Snap-on Tools Group in the second quarter. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.9 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.7 billion from our U.S. operation. Approximately 82% of our U.S. financing portfolio relates to extended credit loans to technicians. In the first quarter, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $50.9 million, or 2.7%. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these are tracking somewhat higher year-over-year, but continued to be inline with our expectations in view of an appropriate risk reward balance in this segment of our business. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12-month net losses of $40.4 million represented 2.61% of outstanding to quarter-end, up 51 basis point year-over-year and 14 basis points sequentially. However, net losses related to finance receivables of $10.8 million in the second quarter sequentially improved by $0.4 million from $11.2 million in the first quarter. In addition, finance receivables more than 90 days past due stood at 0.9% of outstanding as the second quarter end, which was also a sequential improvement from 1.1% at the end of the first quarter. 60-day delinquency rate of 1.4% in our U.S. extended credit portfolio increased 30 basis points year-over-year, but remains stable compared to the first quarter. Overall, profitability in the financial services segment rose by 10.3% year-over-year, an improved $2.1 million sequentially. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $127.1 million in the quarter, decreased $35 million from comparable 2016 levels, primarily due to higher working investment partially offset by higher 2017 net earnings. During the quarter, we also elected to $15 million in the discretionary contributions into our domestic pension plan, an increase of $5 million as compared to Q2 2016. Net cash used by investing activities of $138.6 million, included additions to finance receivables of $231.8 million, partially offset by collections of $179.1 million. Capital expenditures of $15.8 million in the quarter, compared with $20.6 million last year. During the second quarter, we also acquired Norbar Torque Tool. Based in the United Kingdom, Norbar included in the C&I segment, is a leading European manufacturer of full range of torque products and has a strong present in the critical industries. Net cash used by financing activities of $23.4 million included dividend payments to shareholders of $41.1 million and the repurchase of 535,000 shares of common stock for $86.7 million under our previously announced share repurchase programs. We had saw opportunity in the quarter to step-up share repurchase and did so at higher level than usual. Year-to-date share repurchase totaled 745,000 shares for $122.5 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by a higher short-term borrowing, principally commercial paper. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $46.5 million from 2016 year-end level, including $15.4 million of foreign currency translation and $7.1 million from acquisitions. Day sales outstanding 66 days is up from 53 days at year-end including the impact of acquisition, which increase DSOs by about one day. Inventories increased $70.9 million from 2016 year-end, primarily in support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions. Foreign currency translation contributed $16.6 million of the increase, as this $4.8 million from acquisitions. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.2 compared to 3.38 year-end. Our quarter-end cash position of $89 million, increased a $11.4 million in 2016 year-end level. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was unchanged from 26.3% at 2016 year-end. In addition to our $89 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities, and our current short-term credit ratings allow us access to the commercial paper markets. As of quarter-end, we had $83.5 million of commercial paper borrowing outstand. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on second quarter Tools Group, tepid growth, but having the advantages going forward of a strong franchise network and a robust market. C&I accelerating growth, up mid single-digit, broad gains in the critical industries and the continuing upward march of SNA Europe and RS&I, another high single-digit quarter, up 8.3% organically each division contributing to that rise, confirming both the opportunities in automotive repair and our progress with repair shop owners and managers. The positives of C&I and RS&I combining to overcome the challenges in tools, making for overall organic growth of 2.7% and Snap-on Value Creation, driving improvement, customer connection, innovation in RCI, authoring margin progress again. Opco OI margins of 19.9%, a rise of 80 basis points against currency and acquisitions. And acquisition, presenting near-term margin dilution, but offering further landscapes for Snap-on Value Creation and margin improvement going forward, it was a quarter in which we saw a challenges, but overall, we overcame and demonstrated growth and improvement again. EPS of $2.60, up 10.2%. It was an encouraging quarter. And we\u2019re confident. We\u2019re market that our markets have the opportunity, our businesses have the position and our team has the capability to continue our ongoing positive trend and performance going forward. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019d speak to our franchisees and associates listening to the call. The encouraging result to the second quarter reflect your capability and your commitment, for your ongoing achievement and your commitment. For your ongoing achievements, you have my congratulation. And for your extraordinary dedication to our team, you have my thanks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll now take a question from Liam Burke with FBR Capital. Liam Burke : Thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Liam. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Liam Burke : Nick, can you give us some color on diagnostics sales and what the innovation or new product pipeline would look like in that area of the business? Nick Pinchuk : Well, we don\u2019t like to give away the secrets that we\u2019re going to rollout say at the SFC or so because we like to electrify the people who go there. I just talked to our franchisee in California who said, he likes to get the fever when he goes on the floor. So we want to have that, but look, our thermal imagers are still selling well. That still got legs, that\u2019s the new category that\u2019s going well. Overall in the Tools Group, the diagnostics category was up, I think mid single digits in the U.S. The U.S. numbers, have those. So if that was in part of that statement raise, and even in that we saw a destocking so it would have been up bigger without what we perceived to be destock, so you have that and then you have the ETHOS, which is the next level. We keep refreshing the platform. Remember, there are four levels of platform. ETHOS, for the entry-level tech; SOLIS for the guy who kind of worked on breaks, and there\u2019s a whole bunch of the other little bit, more sophisticated jobs; MODIS for the guy who really works on the more complicated jobs and VERUS for the guy who works on those things that only happen on money. So we rolled out the ETHOS and we\u2019re doing out some new wrinkles in the SFC, but the ETHOS has just come out, very early days. We have it in the script here, but that\u2019s only been selling for a little while, but the first numbers are pretty good. It was up nicely in the second quarter. Liam Burke : Okay. And on the Rock \u2018N Roll Van, you said you were going to go back and do some things differently. What would you anticipate doing to improve the space constraints that the van drivers would have on some of the products? Nick Pinchuk : Sure. One of the things that when we saw these results, I decided to talk to a bunch of franchisees. So in the last couple of weeks, I don\u2019t know when we got the results, but I\u2019d say a couple of weeks ago. Right away I met with guys from Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, rode some vans in Arkansas and Texas told the guys in New Hampshire, Florida and California and almost everybody said that the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab had lost some of its excitement. So it\u2019s a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s not really the function, Liam, it\u2019s having people get on the van and saying, oh this is something different, an experience. I want to get on the van and experience because that\u2019s what they did before. So we\u2019ll do stuffs like rapid differently with some of our new facilities. We\u2019ll reorganize the tool boxes. We\u2019ll try to put some more spiffier and stuff on in terms of the box as on the van. So I\u2019d like to say, it\u2019s a matter of this, when the technicians were getting on, they \u2013 they get feedback on them and they, think I saw this. Now some of the guys have bought because they look at the boxes, but other guys were kind of saying, I done that, so we\u2019re going to try to make it a different experience, move around some of the floor plan, maybe kind of put on some a little better computer aid, things like that. So I think it\u2019s really to change the \u2013 I want to say the cosmetics of it more than anything else, so people feel as though they\u2019re getting a different experience. Liam Burke : Great. Thank you, Nick. Operator : We\u2019ll now move to David Leiker with Baird. David Leiker : Good morning, gentlemen. How are you doing? Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, David. David Leiker : Couple things, I\u2019m trying to \u2013 I guess I\u2019m trying to slice the business up a little bit to get a deeper understanding on some of the pieces. Can you talk within \u2013 first of all, you said on the tools side that the destocking. Is there way to characterize what the selloff the truck volume was during the quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look. I don\u2019t think we want to get pinning down that variable, but what I\u2019ll tell you is sort of like this. You think about it this way. Tool storage was down fairly significantly even off the trucks, but less so than we had, okay. So that\u2019s why we say tool storage, the product line. We believe it needs to refresh. We need the marketing, the Rock \u2018N Roll vans need something that helps and so we\u2019re working on that. If you look at everything else, if you take everything else, like this, two type you are very familiar with this, it\u2019s easy that the finance stuff and the RA stuff, the stuff that what we know is the stuff that the franchisee sells on his own credit like hand tools and power tools and shop and pack, and in some portions of diagnostics. That was up fairly significantly, towards the top of the ranges that we expect to see from the Tools Group. So we would have classified that it as a fairly robust quarter, looking at the sales off the van, that didn\u2019t translate into our sales though. Our sales were quite mixed in those categories and a quite tepid. So what we \u2013 and you talk to the franchisees and what they said was it makes sense is that always July is the lowest quarter because people are getting ready. But what happened over the years is more and more the ordering is taking place in these burst. That doesn\u2019t mean the second quarter becomes incandescent, but they\u2019re taking place at these bursts and so I think they\u2019ll be more aware of the need to kind of get ready for these orders. Last year, the orders in the SFC were up quite strongly in the before as well. So what\u2019s happening is, is that they\u2019re bleeding out \u2013 out of July into June, that\u2019s what happened. We saw a significantly weaker tail end of June than we have seen in the past. David Leiker : Okay. And then the other item you mentioned it couple of times in your call, obviously the topic going on in the marketplace today. Can you talk about the changes \u2013 the terms you did with your franchisees on the credit side, how frequently you make those changes, just some initial color behind that. Nick Pinchuk : We make them pretty much every year, some kind of changes and I think since 2009 or 2010 we\u2019ve made significant changes in most of the years, in a lot of years so that happens. What you do is you look at how people are performing. You say how is the business? How are the franchisees? Who are big active parts? You try to restructure the program so it guides them to get the best out of their opportunity, and that\u2019s what we did. And so that had some initial impact because we identified some customers who are weaker and we said some of the franchisees are having some of the greatest results, and that\u2019s where we strip them. So those franchisees would be focused on those guys and really couldn\u2019t deal with them as much. Whereas other guys, we have lots of faith and we let them deal with that same category, that\u2019s the restriking pretty much. David Leiker : And then the last item here again on the credit side, if we could talk a little bit about, I mean you can tell by the yield that clearly, if you go back a couple of years, you took in some high-risk customers, some of that was after CIP funding the credit company. Recently, that seems to have backed off a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about what those credit losses are in the pool of high-risk customers when we\u2019ll see those flow through the credit losses in terms of peak loss period. Aldo Pagliari : David it\u2019s Aldo. I think you\u2019re seeing that now when you look at the year-over-year differences in the rate of provision and the rate of charge-offs. And I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re going to see a decline in those rates, so to speak, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see an acceleration either. And I think if you look since the started of the year, there\u2019s been rather good amount of stability, so it\u2019s rather cut them out. So the portfolio constituents are more or less where they\u2019re at right now, I don\u2019t see that changing very much. I think the franchisees are always adjusting as Nick suggested to the fact and circumstances that they face on the Street each and every day, but the portfolio losses right now are more or less stable throughout the year, at least year-to-date. David Leiker : Is that fair to say, I\u2019m going to jump to the conclusion, but is it fair to say with that commentary that credit profile, credit risk profile, the people who are coming into the credit side on the origination side are similar to what the overall pool is today? Aldo Pagliari : It\u2019s a hard question to answer because you have a \u2013 you have the portfolio whose customer FICO scores are improving and the other half of the portfolio that actually might be a little bit less than improving. So if you look at the mix overall, the average FICO score of the portfolio has been rather consistent, but anything goes out, it changes overtime but not dramatically. David Leiker : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Aldo Pagliari : Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll now take a question from Scott Stember with C.L. King. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Scott Stember : Could you maybe talk about the timing of when comparisons in the Tools Group get a little bit easier and most considerably with regards to tool storage? And then maybe secondarily, just talk about some of these changes in the vans, make them a little bit more exciting, increasing traffic into the vans for tool storage, when that will actually start to take place? Thanks. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Look, I don\u2019t know. Look, I don\u2019t think we ever think we have easy comparisons. I think we kind of look \u2013 I mean, okay. The comparisons are easier, but they\u2019re up 0.5%. This is the best second quarter ever in terms of sales. I mean, the increase wasn\u2019t the best, and the profitability is the best ever. So I don\u2019t think we think in those terms. I think the question is how you are going to restart, it\u2019s clear to us that the primary factor in the sale slim situation in tools was tool storage. So first is product. Tool storage is among the most discretionary things. You\u2019ve got excite people they got to want it, they got to aspire to have it. We\u2019re working the SFC will come up in early August will be launching a whole bunch of new product that the SFC to try to roll people and excite them. We tried some of that in the second quarter, some of it worked and it wasn\u2019t enough and then the tool storage and the van, the Rock \u2018N Roll Cab, there are I think 67 of them. So what we will do over the next, say, quarter, we\u2019ll be developing \u2013 in this quarter, let\u2019s say, we\u2019ll be developing possibilities for the new van. We\u2019ll probably test some of them and then we\u2019ll roll them out whatever works best. So it will be a test period, development period, a test period and then a rollout period. And you tend to roll them out, so you should start seeing some of that as, well, I don\u2019t know, toward the later end of the year, things like that. But first is product. The first factor is product. First factor is product. Scott Stember : Got it. And just last question. Yes, sure, you talked about the sell-through on the vans, I guess outside of the tool storage of being relatively strong or actually to the high-end of the year, which you look for. Can you maybe just give us a flavor of how high that was? Just give a comfort level to how strong the rest of the business is doing? Nick Pinchuk : Okay. I\u2019d say that Snap-on should grow at 4% to 6%. I\u2019ve said this for a dog\u2019s age. That\u2019s my range. So I\u2019m talking to the end of that range. That\u2019s the kind of thing we talk about, right? Okay. Scott Stember : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : We will now take a question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning all. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Gary. Gary Prestopino : A couple of questions. On the C&I Group, I think you said that you had some pretty good sell-through there in hand tools and then across various markets. But I\u2019m wondering, were all of the markets within the C&I Group, is this one of the first times where you\u2019ve really seen upsales year-over-year? And I\u2019m particularly interested if some of those laggard groups like military and energy are starting to energize. Nick Pinchuk : Look, natural resources was up. Natural resources, in general, that sort of natural resource segment was up. International aerospace, which had been a laggard, was up. We\u2019re very pleased to see that. Military, actually, was flat. I kind of viewed that \u2013 kind of flat, it was up a little bit. I kind of view that as a positive, Gary, because the thing is military, as you know, it\u2019s kind of lumpy and it had been dominating our quarters. So actually, last quarter was sort of the same kind of thing, we had broad growth. This time with military, not as much a factor in the growth situation. And this time, the same thing was the case. So this was a very healthy quarter and you\u2019re seeing acceleration in industrial. C&I\u2019s numbers, if you go back and look at them, you\u2019ll see that we threw, four quarters ago, 1.5%, 2.4%, 3% and 4.7%. So people, if you look at this, other people have looked at the segment and say, well, there\u2019s some deceleration. Well, this is acceleration. And so that\u2019s pretty positive, and the nature of that\u2019s been pretty good. And industrial has been up higher than that. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then some of the strength you\u2019re seeing in the RS&I Group with diagnostic equipment and other equipment, I\u2019m really more pertaining to diagnostic, do you feel that, that\u2019s a function of really rolling out some of these newer products? And in conjunction with that, you\u2019re starting to get some cars that are four or five years old that had maybe a higher technological content than cars that were 10 years old, flowing through in the \u2013 to the independent repair shop market? Nick Pinchuk : Sure. There\u2019s a \u2013 I don\u2019t want to short change some other factors in there. But if you look at the diagnostics, it\u2019s a great tailwind. The increasing need for diagnostics to create repair, you know it as well as I do, is that 40%, 50% of repairs on cars today require diagnostic. But new cars, that\u2019s all the cars 11.5-year-old average car fleet, but if you look at new cars it\u2019s 80% of the repairs. So there\u2019s an increasing demand. You hear it in the shops when you go around. We have the best goal alternatives. So you see our new products rolling out, exciting customers, solving their problems against the backdrop of their needs, that\u2019s partially what you\u2019re seeing, and diagnostics was up nicely in that quarter. But I wouldn\u2019t want to short change Mitchell, which is a purely short, purely software business, which provides repair shop management and provide repair shop \u2013 repair information, our Sure Track database with the 1 billion record that only we have of repair, shortcutting repairs. That was up big in the \u2013 nicely in the quarter. So you take those two things, I think diagnostics is in \u2013 I mean, RS&I, in general, is in a situation where the tailwinds are only intensifying and where the best game in town. Gary Prestopino : Right, thanks. And then the last question really pertains to tool storage and you say you refreshed the product, refreshed the vans. When was the last time that you actually did something like this? And then how long after you refreshed did the sales start reinvigorating themselves? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t refresh. We launched the tool storage vans and this is \u2013 you got the first \u2013 when you launch, you probably \u2013 I think it\u2019s fair to say we had some periods where we\u2019re adjusting. But really, they\u2019ve been pretty much the same since we launched like five years ago. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Nick Pinchuk : So we haven\u2019t had that information in this kind of fleet. We haven\u2019t had this kind of fleet. This was a brand new idea. You remember I said it\u2019s the kind of idea that came to the Tools Group guys. We thought it was brilliant. It accelerated tool storage sales. But now, it\u2019s kind run out of mojo. Now we\u2019re still generating some sales, but franchisees are telling me that what they used to generate is now half of what they generated when they get these guys in a route, so we need to pump them up. But this is why we have managers to figure this out, that\u2019s what we do. Gary Prestopino : Yes. I guess, what I was getting at, Nick, is there something on the product side that you \u2013 do you refresh every five years understanding like\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : No. No, I think we try to \u2013 what happens is, Gary, we try to roll out new product at the SFC or the kickoffs every year. This year, we\u2019re particularly energized to do it. So you can see sales, you can see ordering pretty quickly from the franchisees. I didn\u2019t get a feeling for that pretty quickly at how good that worked. The question is, is it going to play out into the marketplace? So there are two levels, getting the franchisees interested and then having the technicians look at it and say, \"Hey, I got to have that box. I already got a box, but I got to replace mine.\" Gary Prestopino : So I guess the question I would have is relative to new products or product refreshes that you bring into this annual meeting that you have. On the tool storage side, have you done more in terms of maybe intro or refreshing product than you would usually do? Nick Pinchuk : We\u2019re doing more and we\u2019re certainly going to do more in tool storage at the SFC this year than we have been in the past. So think about the SFC though, no matter how much the SFC orders are, remember, they\u2019re ordering for like six months, so it doesn\u2019t happen immediately, right? Okay. But we\u2019re doing more. Sure, this is the whole thing. We think the product line is weak. If it\u2019s not doing, we got to pump it up. Gary Prestopino : Okay, thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Gary. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David MacGregor from Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a few questions here for you. Nick, could you just talk about the destocking in the extent to which that may be related to some of the changes you made in the credit business? Nick Pinchuk : We don\u2019t think it\u2019s that. We think the credit is \u2013 while the destocking is something completely different. The destocking is, we think \u2013 I think I try to \u2013 this is my view, David, is that, look, and I think it\u2019s our view here. There are two factors we\u2019re talking about on the Tools Group, destocking and the weakness in tool storage. Destocking is a completely different thing. The destocking is there driven by the size of the orders that are occurring in the SFC and the feeling that our people want to clear the decks. This is happening in every product line, not just tool storage. So from our perspective, that\u2019s not really a factor there. If you come back to the tool storage sales, you could argue \u2013 and I think I did say that it\u2019s a tertiary effect, so we don\u2019t believe it\u2019s the primary driver. But re-striping had some initial effect on this, for sure, but we don\u2019t think it\u2019s the primary driver when we look at the numbers. David MacGregor : Okay. Second question is on margins in the tools segment, which were pretty darn good. I guess, could you just talk about the strength at 19.5%, I guess given the flat top line, then how we should think about your ability to maintain this level of margin progression heading into the second half of the year? Nick Pinchuk : I think a couple of things are in there. The first is that if you go back and you look at our numbers, it\u2019s not \u2013 if you look at our numbers by division, it\u2019s not unusual to see that kind of growth. It isn\u2019t necessarily directly proportional to the volume. I mean, we have RCI products and new products that rollout that are a lot more, a lot more capable and a lot more value, and therefore, higher margins as they rollout to the industry. So it really plays out how long those new products and how many new ones we rollout, and how effective they are. And then in this particular \u2013 so in this quarter, in that area, we have things like the PT850. I think I talked about it last time, our new half inch impact wrench, very, very popular product. In the atmosphere of tepid sales, that one sold very well, nice margins. I talked about the long handle ratchet\u2019s that have the flex heads and were \u2013 gave great leverage and also gave great access, that sold better than \u2013 great margins. And these margins transformed our categories in terms of margins. What happened in the destocking in a lot of situation is some of the more standard and core product didn\u2019t sell as much because they were products that we\u2019re already on the van. And so that was, perhaps, lower margin so it\u2019s skews the thing towards there. And then we had good leverage in the way our businesses were stronger internationally than they were in the U.S. and the compensation in the international is a little bit different. So we tend to get a little bit more leverage and drop through volume leverage out of the volume, so that\u2019s what made for that. I think it\u2019s hard to say what the sustainability is of this, but we believe, I\u2019ve said this over and over and over and over again, that we believe we can drive margins up, absent volume increases. And if you look at our numbers, 19.9% ain\u2019t chopped liver. It\u2019s our highest ever. And so you go back and you look at this quarter, for example, this quarter is very similar to last 20 quarters, 9 quarters were similar to this and we grew 100 basis points or more. So I really believe maybe the 19.5% isn\u2019t sustainable every quarter, but it\u2019s an indication we can reach that level and we keep going off those levels, that\u2019s our history. David MacGregor : Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. The storage growth, I don\u2019t want to beat this thing to death, but Aldo, in his discussion, the originations mentioned that there have been $12.5 million decline in the originations related to storage, 5.1%. Is that a good proxy for how we should think about the extent to which storage was down year-over-year? Nick Pinchuk : No. Storage is down more than that. David MacGregor : Can you quantify that for us? Nick Pinchuk : Well, storage is down double digits. I don\u2019t want to get confused here because I spoke probably for the first time on this call about sales off the van. Don\u2019t get confused about sales off \u2013 I\u2019m talking about our sales. Storage was down double digits. And so that played out into a different lower originations. But remember, in originations, originations are the franchisee sales. Their storage was down but not as much. And then you also have in that, you have other products like diagnostic units and other things like that so it\u2019s hard to make that characterization. But I just thought tool storage was painful. David MacGregor : Yes. Last questions just on the originations. With originations maybe set to go through kind of a negative growth pattern here for at least the foreseeable future. This would presume that you got a little bit more cash, sort of discretionary use of free cash flow. You were jacking up your share repurchase activity this quarter, which was good to see. Do we expect to see that pattern maintain going forward? Do you sort of lean a little harder into the repurchase as use of cash? Nick Pinchuk : No. I think we\u2019re always discussing the use of cash and we\u2019ve always said, I think, that you have investment in your business and you have acquisitions and you have dividend, and of course share repurchase is part of that. So we always consider that in the context of the cash availability, the authorizations we have from the board and the attractiveness of the pricing. David MacGregor : Thanks Nick. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hi, good morning guys. A question on the destocking discussion. I guess the franchisees have a minimum balance requirement anyhow. How close does the average franchisee runs to minimum balance? I mean how much more potential for destocking is there? Or are we really sort of out of \u2013 are we going to find some base relatively soon? Nick Pinchuk : Look, I think this, I think we\u2019re going to see destocking through July then they\u2019re going to come up to the SFC. This destocking, I don\u2019t think \u2013 it wasn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t think it was driven so much by people saying, I got too much inventory. It was driven more by the idea, that the ordering patterns are migrating toward big orders \u2013 more toward big orders at the buy, twice a year events. And they order these things because they, like I said, the franchisers get on the floor and they get the fever and are able to \u2013 for the first time, touch the product and they order the packages, they see the new product and they tend to order more and these things get delivered for like six, eight months after that. So the lower they are \u2013 the better \u2013 the more stabilized they are going into that, they\u2019re starting to realize, the better off they\u2019re to manage that six, eight month delivery pattern that they\u2019ve signed up for when they go into these places. That\u2019s was happening so there\u2019s a little bit more ordering happening at the big events and less maybe on whatever the monthly events are. We have monthly events and so, I think, that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying. And because the SFC has been sold, I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing because the SFC has been sold successful, people are bringing it down. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re thinking that, oh, I\u2019m joking on inventory. Bret Jordan : Okay. I guess in your inventory, you talked about growth around new programs and future customer demand. Can you talk about the categories that you\u2019re growing? Is this RS&I inventory that you\u2019re building up because you\u2019re seeing so much strength there? Or just some increase in your inventory, as you seen a little bit of destock but you\u2019re building inventory with expectation as they\u2019ve tick it up in the current quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. The answer is for both of those. Look, I think we saw it some destock, but we\u2019re kind of confident that \u2013 as the SFC rolls out, that inventory is going to be quite useful that\u2019s we\u2019re building toward. The RS&I business, hey, it\u2019s smoking. It went well. I mean, the thing is in RS&I, in some cases, we can sell \u2013 we want to have inventory because we have quite good demand and even in the Tools Group, really. I mean, we sold \u2013 I believe, we sold every PT850 we could build this quarter. So I mean, the thing is you do have this kind of things, so we\u2019re happy to have some inventory going to the SFC for that kind of thing. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then on the last call, we talked about \u2013 I\u2019m running a special sort of tool color program that was going to drive incremental demand. Have we\u2019ve rolled that out yet? Or is that something that coming in the current quarter around this big event? Nick Pinchuk : No, no. We\u2019ve rolled it out and it worked, but didn\u2019t have enough effect. We rolled out a special call and we had a couple of split with top boxes, with the couple of minor changes. We did it as quick as we could because we \u2013 second quarter, we weren\u2019t quite ready for it. So we rolled that out and it worked pretty well. It was a purple box. Now, we have a number of different things like different mechanisms for the box, different power configurations for different product lines, different in array of more colors that come out in like an SFC. So it\u2019s a much more comprehensive thing. Bret Jordan : Okay. And a housekeeping question for Aldo. On corporate expense, I think a couple of years ago, I think you guys have given some a range of guidance like 90 to 100 and we keep coming in below that. Should I think about future corporate expense being closer to what we\u2019re seeing this quarter? Or does that whole guide still hold? Aldo Pagliari : I think the guide holds, Bret, for this year we\u2019re trending towards the low end of that range, so 90 is about a good target. The reason we have made a little bit the progress this quarter is every second quarter, we true up our pension calculations working with our actuaries. We got a little bit of good news and it\u2019s accounts for most of the year-over-year improvement this quarter, when it comes to that. And then as you go forward, you don\u2019t have the quite benefit of that one-time adjustment. So anyway, corporate expenses trend and may be more towards 90-ish. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. I thanks a lot guys. I appreciate it. Operator : We will now take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thanks, good morning. On the \u2013 taking credit a little during the quarter, saw that in originations in tool storage, I think there is probably a relationship there. Would we expect a bigger impact in the third quarter with the full period of the tighter credit practices? Nick Pinchuk : Well, you\u2019ll have \u2013 I think we have two months worth in this quarter. You\u2019ll have three months then. On the other hand, you\u2019re offsetting that. Anytime you make a change in credit, people tend to be take a little time to try to understand the new rules more with more clarity. This is just a fact. So I don\u2019t know. You could because you got one more month. On the other hand, you\u2019ll have people operating with more clarity. So I\u2019m not so sure. In any case, we don\u2019t expect the huge impact. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And on the inventory, it sounds like your sort of we anticipating a tail-off of that. Do you think that the tools growth rate has probably put in a bottom here? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I can never comment. I hate to do that because many times, I\u2019ve been humiliated by saying I thought that things were over, but look, we\u2019re not \u2013 this is a very slim quarter for the Tools Group, but I know they\u2019re going to work pretty hard to try to energize this tool storage business and we think the market is strong. So we\u2019ll see how that plays out. I guess, I can\u2019t make any predictions, but I think this is what we do. We revitalize products. We change marketing. This is the kind of thing that Tools Group does and over the years, we\u2019ve been pretty good at it. So I\u2019m confident in them. But I can\u2019t make any predictions on a quarter-to-quarter basis. That\u2019s difficult to say. I\u2019m pretty confident. So that the Tools Group is over time is at \u2013 in that range of 4% to 6%, I\u2019m very confident of that. Christopher Glynn : Okay, thanks. And last one, I was going to ask about to Aldo, how long things that might cycle through this sort of increasing trend of charge-offs? But it sounded, Aldo, like you thought that trend is kind of matured at this juncture. Aldo Pagliari : Yes. I think the kind of level of charge-offs and provisioning we\u2019re seeing right now will be reflective of what we\u2019ll likely see in the second half. You never know what certainty, of course, but like I said, the movement among the credit companies portfolios have been rather stable at this point in time. So we will go back through the level of provisions and what we had a year or so ago, probably not. At the same time, I don\u2019t see it accelerating. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Ms. Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks, Anna and thanks, everyone for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available later on snapon.com, and as always, we appreciate your interest in the company. Good day. Operator : And once again, that does concludes today\u2019s conference. And we thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, is included in our earnings release and conference call slide deck which can be found on our Web site. With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I\u2019ll start with the highlights of our third quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see and then I\u2019ll take you through some of the headwinds we\u2019ve encountered and speak about our progress. Aldo will then provide you a more detailed review of the financials. In the third quarter, we again made overall advancements along our runways for both growth and improvement. Total reported sales were up 8.4% to $903.8 million including 5.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation and a boost from acquisitions, including last year\u2019s Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont operations and this year\u2019s BTC and Norbar business. They combined for an incremental $44.3 million in sales. Overall, organic sales were up 2.3% with varying results across the groups. It\u2019s worth noting I think in this period that the major hurricanes which struck Houston, Florida and Puerto Rico did impact our results. We estimate that the sales in the quarter were reduced by about $8 million, principally in the Tools Group but with some smaller impacts in the other businesses. Now the operations in the affected areas have generally returned to normal, except for Puerto Rico. But as in the case of Superstorm Sandy in 2012, timing of both further disruption and rebuilding aren\u2019t clear. So they could extend into upcoming quarters. Beside the hurricane, we also had a one-time legal charge in the period $15 million to OI or $0.16 to EPS reflecting a California state court judgment in an employment-related litigation brought by an individual that\u2019s being appealed. Excluding the legal charge, OpCo operating margin was 18.6% of sales, down 30 basis points, a 90 basis point impact from acquisitions and unfavorable currency offset in part by operating improvements. For financial services, operating income of 56 million compared to last year\u2019s 50.6 million. Excluding the legal charge, earnings per share as adjusted reached $2.45. That\u2019s an increase of 10.4%. Now let\u2019s speak about the markets. We believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable. We saw mixed results from our businesses in that arena, but based on what we\u2019ve been hearing from our franchisees, from technicians, from shop owners and managers, we believe vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate. And over time, Snap-on\u2019s positions are taking full advantage. For the critical industries, verticals like aviation, oil and gas, mining and heavy duty, we\u2019re seeing recovery. Our activity was strong almost across the board. We like the way the critical industries are sounding and trending. We have further confirmation of that positive outlook from our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe, solid results with substantial growth across the European continent, broad strength; another sign of a favorable environment. We do have challenges but there will also be headwinds. They\u2019ve been a factor in other quarters and this past one was the same. But our markets do offer attractive runways for growth and we believe we\u2019re well positioned to confront and offset the challenges and continue enhancing our van channel, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets. At the same time, those growth runways are joined and supported by the benefits of Snap-on value creation; safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI as we call it. They\u2019re a constant driver of our [indiscernible] especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology. And in this quarter, Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation led to more prestigious product awards than we\u2019ve had; more recognition than in any single year. Snap-on was prominently represented with nine Professional Tool & Equipment News, PTEN, People's Choice Product Awards where the actual users, the technicians made the sections. That\u2019s great endorsement. We\u2019re also recognized with three PTEN Innovation Awards and with three MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Awards and all three of our groups; Tools, RS&I and C&I were part of those achievements. An essential driver on Snap-on growth is innovative products that makes work easier, it\u2019s always been our strength and those third quarter awards are testimony that great Snap-on products just keep coming. That\u2019s the market overview. Now we\u2019ll move to the individual operating groups. Let\u2019s start with Tools. Organic sales down 1.6%. Growth internationally more than offset by declines in the U.S. Operating income in the quarter of 56.3 million, including 2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency compares to 64.6 million in 2016. OI margin of 14.3% versus last year\u2019s 16.3% with that decrease reflecting lower volume and unfavorable mix and a 70 basis point impact of unfavorable foreign currency. The third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, our SFC as we call it. This year it was in Dallas with more than 8,200 attendees, franchisees and family members from over 3,000 routes. It\u2019s an opportunity for franchisees for training and for ordering new product, and it\u2019s a chance for the company to gauge our franchisees\u2019 outlook on the business. Now the order story this year was mixed. Tool storage was up, other products were down and orders were down overall from last year\u2019s record level. But I can attest that the franchisees displayed confidence in our business and optimism in the future. And that positive outlook is reinforced by the advancements evident in our franchisees health metrics, the financial and physical indicators we monitor and evaluate regularly. They remain favorable and robust. We do believe our franchisees continue to grow stronger. And at our most recent National Franchise Advisory Council meeting held just a few weeks ago, I heard the same positive outlook and optimism that was the prevailing mood at the Dallas SFC and there are real reasons for the confidence. The market remains robust and our product line is getting stronger. You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that there\u2019s a continuous stream of winning offerings going forward, attention getters. Like our new tool storage power draw in our Masters and Classic tool storage series. The power draw gives technicians the ability to organize their cordless tool battery chargers multiplying these days in the shop all in one 16-inch wide draw with 510 volt outlets for battery charging and two USB power ports for quick charging cell phones and other electronic devices. It\u2019s configured in a taper device to allow easy access for all seven ports. Power and convenience packaged in the traditional Snap-on tool storage and early reports indicated to win, helping to restart the tool storage line. Also new is our 12-volt inverter-driven engine starter plus. Engineered in our Kenosha, Wisconsin labs and manufactured in our Murphy, North Carolina plants. Arc-less [ph] connection technology that prevents reverse polarity activation that is bad things when you hook a negative up to the positive. And a dual circuit feature accommodating both high current jump starting and standard charge in a small device, the benefits of inverter drive. Launched in September, it\u2019s been received with a kind of enthusiasm that will make another of our hit products. Well, that\u2019s the Tools Group. Now let\u2019s move to RS&I. Sales increased 47.4 million including 21.6 million of acquisition-related sales and 2.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth was 23.7 million or 8.2%, the fourth straight quarter that RS&I has grown organically by high single digits. Operating earnings of 83.4 million increased 11.6 million. The operating margin was close to flat with last year, 25% compared to 25.1%. The acquisitions had an unfavorable impact of 140 basis points. But that headwind was pretty much offset by the benefits of RCI and volume. The robust RS&I growth represents progress across all our businesses in that group with double digit increases in diagnostics and repair information products sold to independent repair shop owners and managers. High single digit increases to OEM dealerships and a low single digit rise on our undercar equipment. And again, in RS&I, customer connection and innovations stood tall offering compelling new offerings, taking advantage of a favorable vehicle repair environment. Innovative new products like our latest handheld, ZEUS, which joins our award-winning diagnostics lineup as the new flagship platform. ZEUS was launched following the SFC in late August and surpasses our highly acclaimed VERUS Edge, building on the capabilities of that popular product but further incorporating our intelligent diagnostic software providing the technician with pinpoint guidance for repair. Intelligent diagnostic is made possible by Snap-on\u2019s proprietary big data that guides the technician in solving those very unusual problems, hard to analyze; those very unusual hard to analyze vehicle repair problems and as a consequence saving a lot of time. It\u2019s no wonder the ZEUS has been well received. And in just a short time it helped drive the strong RS&I progress in the quarter. Diagnostics are becoming increasingly essential to vehicle repair. Snap-on is the gold standard and you can see it in the numbers. So to wrap up RS&I, substantial achievements across the division, improving our position with repair shop owners and managers, continuing a very favorable trend and reinforcing our belief in the strength of the vehicle repair market. Now on to C&I. The sales of 314.6 million in the quarter increased 8.7% including 22.7 million of sales related to acquisitions and 2 million of favorable foreign currency. Organic growth was 0.2%. But that was the result of significant gains in critical industries, higher activity at SNA Europe and a decline in the sales of power tool products at the Tools Group. Operating margin reached 15.9%, up 80 basis points from last year\u2019s 15.1%, improvement reflecting an ongoing stream of innovative new products for critical industries and a robust effort in RCI. They combined in the quarter to more than offset a 40 basis point impact of our recent acquisitions and a 10 basis point decrease from unfavorable foreign currency. Just a word here on our acquisitions; great additions to our product lines. At this point though, they\u2019re dilutive to our profit ratios. But going forward we see them as landscape for improvement as we apply Snap-on value creation to their operations, they\u2019re a great future opportunity. Now back to C&I progress. The industrial division showed broad based gains across most of the critical industries with \u2013 as I said, most of the critical industries with strong year-over-year performance now accomplished for three straight quarters. Critical industries are coming back. And when we couple that favorable environment with innovative new product aimed at solving critical tasks, we get very encouraging results. Advancements driven by innovation by products like our automated tool control unit or ATC, our smart tool box. In critical industries tool use needs to be controlled, safe and productive. Snap-on ATC is the top of the line solution, fully automated organization tool visibility, access control and asset management. And our recent enhancements have made it even better. New options like ZoomID and FastFlag; ZoomID providing individual tool recognition with special tool pegging essentially for serialized, certified or calibrated tools of these individual documentation, like torque wrenches or gauges, all important items for accomplishing critical tasks. And our FastFlag featured display giving the user quick visual feedback on the status of the box, whether it\u2019s locked with all the tools accounted and are unlocked with the tools issued in a use or prompts exist such as wrong tools returned. It\u2019s products like these aimed at industry needs that are helping to drive our progress across the critical industries and we believe the advancements only continue. Now let\u2019s speak about SNA Europe. 16 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth in sales navigating through some difficult geographies and economies. SNA Europe\u2019s volume continues to be positive but its profits are even more encouraging, now up for 18 straight quarters and we believe there\u2019s still an abundant opportunity. One of the ways SNA Europe has been capturing customers is our new Bahco Ergo Tool Management System, the BETMS. It provides the ability to customize the product to specific needs. Actually BETMS demonstrates a key change behind SNA Europe\u2019s positive trend, reaching directly to end users, increasing customer connection, configuring just the right tool kits from the broad SNA Europe lineup and matching customers\u2019 specifications particularly. This new customer direct approach is transforming SNA Europe and helping to drive its ongoing trend of encouraging results. C&I third quarter; maintaining its momentum, extending in critical industries and building both sale and profitability. Well, that\u2019s the highlights of our quarter. Tools Group, working to reenact the van channel; RS&I, clearly continuing its strong and expanding profitability with repair shop owners and managers; and C&I now establishing its own positive trend and growth in profitability extending across critical industries. Progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement, overall sales increasing organically by 2.3% despite the multiple hurricanes. And excluding the legal charge, as adjusted EPS of $2.45, up 10.4% in a turbulent environment. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $903.8 million in the third quarter increased 8.4%, reflecting a 2.3% organic sales gain, $44.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain reflects ongoing progress in serving repair shop owners and managers in the vehicle repair sector as well as solid growth in sales to customers in critical industries and in our European-based hand tools business. Consolidated gross margin of 49.6% declined 60 basis points, primarily due to 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and lower gross margins on acquisition-related sales, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses of $295.5 million included the $50 million charge related to the judgment that, as Nick has mentioned, is being appealed. The operating expense margin of 32.7% was 140 basis points higher as 170 basis points for the legal charge and 30 basis points of operating expenses for acquisitions were partially offset by sales volume leverage. Operating earnings before financial services of $153.1 million or 16.9% of sales included $1.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and the $15 million legal charge and compares to $157.6 million or 18.9% of sales last year. Excluding the legal charge, operating earnings before financial services as adjusted was $168.1 million or 18.6% of sales. Financial services revenue of $79 million and operating earnings of $56 million increased $7.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively, as compared to last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $209.1 million or 21.3% of revenues compared to $208.2 million or 23% of revenues last year. Excluding the legal charge, consolidated operating earnings as adjusted was $224.1 million or 22.8% of revenues. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 30.1% was reduced by 60 basis points as a result of the legal charge. The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was 31.2%. Finally, net earnings of $133.4 million or $2.29 per diluted share compared to $131.7 million or $2.22 per share a year ago, representing a 3.2% increase in diluted earnings per share. Excluding the legal charge, on an after tax basis, net earnings as adjusted of $142.7 million or $2.45 per share represented a 10.4% increase in diluted earnings per share as adjusted. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $314.6 million in the quarter increased 8.7%, reflecting a 0.2% organic sales gain, $22.7 million of acquisition-related sales, and $2.0 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes a high single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries and a low single-digit increase in the segment\u2019s European-based hand tools business. These increases were substantially offset by a double-digit increase in the sales of power tools and a mid single-digit sales decline in the segment\u2019s Asia-Pacific operations. Gross profit of 40.3% increased 130 basis points from 39% last year, primarily due to favorable business mix and benefits from the company\u2019s RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 24.4% increased 50 basis points from 23.9% in 2016, primarily due to 40 basis points of operating expenses for acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.1 million increased $6.4 million from 2016 levels and the operating margin of 15.9% improved 80 basis points. Turning now to Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $392.7 million decreased 1.1%, reflecting a 1.6% organic sales decline, partially offset by $2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease includes a mid single-digit decrease in the company\u2019s U.S. franchise operations partially offset by a double-digit sales gain in the international operations. Gross margin of 41.8% decreased from 43.6% last year, primarily due to a year-over-year shift in product mix and 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 27.5% increased 20 basis points from 27.3%, primarily due to the effect of the lower sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $56.3 million including $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects decreased $8.3 million and the operating margin of 14.3% compared to 16.3% last year. Turning to the RS&I Group, shown on Slide 9, third quarter sales of $333.5 million increased 16.6% reflecting an 8.2% organic sales gain, $21.6 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase was once again solid and broad based, reflecting double-digit gains in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, a high single-digit sales increase to OEM dealerships as well as a low single-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment. Gross margin of 47.3% improved 80 basis points as a result of 40 basis points of benefit from acquisitions and savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 22.3% increased 90 basis points principally due to 180 basis points of impact from acquisitions, partially offset by benefits of sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $83.4 million increased $11.6 million from prior year levels. The operating margin of 25.0% compared to 25.1% last year, including a 140 basis point impact from acquisitions. Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $56.0 million on revenue of $79 million compared to operating earnings of $50.6 million on revenue of $71.6 million last year. Financial services expenses of $23 million increased $2 million, primarily due to an increase in the provisions for credit losses. While total provision expense of $13.6 million in the third quarter is up $2.3 million year-over-year, it is fairly comparable with the $13.4 million incurred in Q2. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.2% in both the third quarters of 2017 and 2016. In the third quarter, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.9% in 2017 compared to 18.0% in 2016. The respected average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% and 9.4%. Total loan originations of $271.8 million in the third quarter increased $2.0 million or 0.7% year-over-year, as higher originations of contract receivables were partially offset by a decline in originations of finance receivables due in part to lower year-over-year tool storage sales by the Snap-on Tools Group. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $1.97 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.71 billion from our U.S. operation. In the third quarter, our worldwide financial services portfolio grew $59.4 million or 3.1%. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, these are as expected tracking higher year-over-year. We believe these trends, however, continue to reflect our view of an appropriate risk reward balance in this segment of our business. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.7 million represented 2.77% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 61 basis point year-over-year and 16 basis points sequentially. However, net losses related to finance receivables of $11.1 million in the third quarter were up sequentially by only $0.3 million from $10.8 million in the second quarter.  The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.7% for U.S. extended credit increased 30 basis points sequentially as compared to a more typical seasonal increase of about 20 basis points. Overall, operating earnings in financial services segment rose 10.7% year-over-year and 2.6% sequentially. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $95.5 million in the quarter decreased $16.4 million from comparable 2016 levels, primarily due to higher working investment. During the quarter, we also elected to make a $30 million discretionary contribution into our domestic pension plans, an increase of $20 million as compared to Q3 2016. Net cash used by investing activities of $61.1 million included net additions to finance receivables of $35.2 million. Capital expenditures of $22.9 million in the quarter compared with $16.5 million last year. Net cash used by financing activities of $29.5 million included dividend payments to shareholders of $40.7 million and the repurchase of 603,000 shares of common stock for $90.1 million under our previously announced share repurchase programs. Year-to-date share repurchases totaled 1.35 million shares for $212.6 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by higher short-term borrowing, principally commercial paper. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $76.4 million from 2016 year-end level, including $22.2 million of foreign currency translation and $9.1 million from acquisitions. Days sales outstanding of 67 days was up from 63 days at year-end including the impact of acquisition and currency which combined increased DSOs by about three days. Inventories increased $119.4 million from 2016 year-end, primarily to support continued higher customer demand and new product introductions resulting from, as an example, increased penetration into critical industries and emerging markets. In addition, foreign currency translation and acquisitions contributed $24.1 million and $6 million of the increase, respectively. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.1 compared to 3.3 at year-end. Our quarter-end cash position of $94.1 million increased $16.5 million from 2016 year-end levels. Our net debt-to-capital ratio increased to 27.6% from 26.3% at 2016 year-end.  In addition to our $94.1 million of cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter-end, we had $170 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, that\u2019s the third quarter. Sales growth and expanded profit in turbulence. We feel quite positive regarding our position. Our markets; vehicle repair remains attractive and the critical industries are recovering. Our businesses; RS&I is expanding with repair shop owners and managers strengthening its already extraordinary hardware and software product lines with the ZEUS breaking new ground in vehicle diagnostics. RS&I are registering its fourth straight quarter of high single-digit growth and a profitability that keeps improving offsetting the dilution of acquisitions. C&I extending the critical industries, the industrial division achieving broad growth, the third straight quarter of positive performance driven by new product that match the needs of professional. And SNA Europe, ongoing growth trend, sales up for 16 straight quarters and profits rising 18 straight. It\u2019s a difficult environment with more to go. And C&I profitability, 15.9%, up 80 basis points against a 50 basis impact of acquisitions and currency. And the Tools Group undergoing some tuning but still a strong business in a strong market. The Tools Group is a combination of market, brand, business model and team that we believe are natural advantages and that we believe will author positive trends going forward. And our acquisitions; dilutive now, but as we apply Snap-on value creation we see abundant possibilities for gain. And all of that added up in the quarter to growth and improvement. Sales up 8.4% as reported, 2.3% organically against 80 basis points of hurricane. And excluding the legal charges, adjusted EPS at $2.45, a rise of 10.4%. Going forward, we believe we have wide runways for growth and improvement and we have the business models, the processes and the capabilities to take full advantage and continue our progress on into the fourth quarter and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019ll speak to our franchisees and associates. The advancements we\u2019ve made and the headwinds we\u2019ve overcome are a direct result of your energy, your capability and your dedication. For your success in authoring our progress, you have my congratulations. And for your dedication to our team, you have my thanks. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Gary Prestopino [Barrington Research]. Gary Prestopino : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Gary. Gary Prestopino : A couple of things. Aldo, could you just go through on the RS&I the percentage increases that you cited there in terms of the sale with the various broad-based product categories? I couldn\u2019t write quick enough. Aldo Pagliari : So again I think I framed it this way is that it was solid really pretty across the board. They were up high single digits if you look at the diagnostics and repair information sector. They were up in sales to OEM dealerships mid single digits and also I think they were low single digits in sales of undercar equipment. So a pretty solid performance across the board. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Then, Nick, did I hear you said right at the franchisees the conference that you had that tool storage sales were up but other sales were down. Is that correct? Nick Pinchuk : That\u2019s what you heard. Now I want to make sure that everybody who\u2019s listening just understands. The SFC \u2013 when we talk about the SFC we talk about orders, not sales. These are orders that occur off the SFC floor. It\u2019s a big floor that shows products. And so there are orders and those orders can be distributed over several quarters. Some of them are for the third quarter, some are for the fourth and they stretch out into the first quarter, maybe even to the second quarter of next year. So it\u2019s spread out over a period of time. So SFC orders aren\u2019t necessarily a direct indicator of what\u2019s to come in any particular quarter or even in total. But that\u2019s the characteristics of it. Our tool storage product, remember we said we were going to try to adjust the tool storage product line, make it more attractive. I think it looks attractive and the orders on the SFC floor seem to make [indiscernible]. Gary Prestopino : Can you give us an idea of the magnitude of the increase and the decrease or not? Nick Pinchuk : I think we\u2019re talking about mid single digits, that kind of thing. But if you remember last year was record \u2013 I said in my remarks, last year\u2019s SFC was a record performance for orders. Now again I want to emphasize. Nobody should get overheated about orders off the SFC. They\u2019re just indicative of things. They\u2019re not necessarily definitive about things. But it\u2019s better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. Gary Prestopino : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David Leiker [Baird]. David Leiker : Good morning, everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, David. David Leiker : Aldo, just two numbers questions first. On the acquisition, I know you went through by segment. You talked about how much dilutive they were along the way. But can you \u2013 at a corporate level, at the EBIT line, the acquisitions are dilutive by what kind of a number? Aldo Pagliari : Sure. If you look at the overall corporation, the acquisitions depressed earnings by about 50 basis points if you look at the OpCo operating margins as a percent of sales. And again that\u2019s strictly the ratio that the acquisitions start with an OI percentage that\u2019s lower than the average of the business units that they\u2019ve been subsumed into. And over time we expect to be able to add some value creation tactics into those results and improve them. David Leiker : Is there an intent to ascend those businesses to get them to \u2013 within each of those segments to \u2013 the segment level margins or is there room for something further than that? Aldo Pagliari : I think each acquisition stands on its own and is unique as you know whether they\u2019re acquisitions of recent times. There\u2019s a small one that was software related. And our hardware related business such as undercar equipment is not going to reach the levels of the software business, but we think there\u2019s opportunity to improve. David Leiker : And then you had mentioned a transactional item in Snap-on Tools segment, I\u2019m guessing that exports out of the U.S. with the weaker dollar into Canada, UK? Aldo Pagliari : Sure. So if you look at it again, we still have the dilemma \u2013 not dilemma, it\u2019s just that we manufacture tools in the United States and sell them internationally. So if you look at the timing of when currency changes in Canada and in United Kingdom, particularly in the United Kingdom, you have timing differences related to inventory but that\u2019s where most of the transaction negative effect occurs. David Leiker : Okay. And then if we take a look at the storm tonight, I know this is \u2013 we\u2019re not dealing with hard data on this, but if you look at what happened in Texas and Florida and you talked about the sales impact to that. Can you flush that out just a little bit in terms of what kind of an impact there might have been at Snap-on credit in terms of originations, delinquencies, losses at all, any color you could share there? Aldo Pagliari : Sure. We took some \u2013 I\u2019d say still rather nominal increases in the provision within the quarter. So the provision is up specific a bit to some of the effects of the hurricanes. Now traditionally when we look back over events in the past, like Katrina and Superstorm Sandy, over time there\u2019s no clear evidence that storms such as these result in permanent disruption to the credit business. Having said that, certainly Puerto Rico is a bit of a different animal, so we\u2019ll look into the future and see how that develops. But to give you some dimensions, David, is that if you look at the portfolio on these areas, if you look at Texas that was affected, in Florida, a little bit of Georgia and into the Caribbean, you\u2019re looking at probably 9.8% of the U.S. EC portfolio just to give you a dimension. And if you look within that, about 2.6% of the whole U.S. portfolio, people have asked for extensions. We have a process where people can ask \u2013 if they\u2019re in good standing, they can ask for an extension and we certainly honor that request if they\u2019re in a distressed situation. So that gives you a little bit of a dimension as to what is out there. As we go forward in Q4, we\u2019ll see what the impact is on collection activity and remittances. But it\u2019s certainly too early to tell. So we took some provisions in Q3. I think Q4 will be a little bit more telling. If you go back to Superstorm Sandy, we didn\u2019t see the full effects of Sandy really until one or two quarters after. David Leiker : And then two or three quarters beyond that, you see a positive impact I would guess? Aldo Pagliari : There\u2019s a potential. Obviously most of us I think would expect there to be rebuilding. Certainly there\u2019s going to be auto repair if your car has been damaged and garages will have to replace equipment that\u2019s been under water or adversely impacted and I think that\u2019s been the tradition. Again, Puerto Rico could be a little bit longer for it to return and how it returns [indiscernible]. Our activity in Puerto Rico is we sell annually in Puerto Rico $5 million maybe. David Leiker : Okay. And then one last item. Nick, if you could talk a little bit about the power tool weakness, that\u2019s something that we hadn\u2019t really been seeing? It\u2019s been more of a growth driver for your business. But if you could give us some color on what\u2019s going on there? Nick Pinchuk : Look, I think partly it has to do with tension. One of the things we talked about in the second quarter was that the profitability of the Tools Group is very strong and a lot of that was driven by the introduction of new power tools, particularly our PT850. And that really had a big spike in the second quarter driving both the profitability and some of the sales to that business and I think we had some of the \u2013 one of the big factors here was just sort of a giveback for that strong power tools quarter in the second quarter. That\u2019s the primary situation. And David, every one of our quarters if we gave you \u2013 if you wanted to focus on these things, there will always be ups and downs. And so this is just down for power tools and those power tools come out of Asia and our Murphy, North Carolina and our Kenosha factories. So that\u2019s what [indiscernible] both in C&I. David Leiker : And then just one follow up on that one. If you took kind of Q2, Q3 together with power tools, would that have been consistent with what the pattern had been? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, I think this might be a little weaker but nothing to get in \u2013 but nothing really to get our attention. David Leiker : Great. Thank you very much for the time. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor [Longbow Research]. David MacGregor : Good morning, everyone. Nick, I wondered if you could just talk about the deterioration in Tools segment operating margins. And I\u2019m guessing some of this may have been attributable to the storms, but it also looks kind of working through the numbers, so maybe you had some weakness in some of the small ticket sales as well. And I wondered if you could just sort of --? Nick Pinchuk : That\u2019s certainly right. What happened was is that the deterioration of the \u2013 if you might remember what drove the good strong margins in the second quarter was I think we cited two particularly products, the power tool, the 850 and particularly some of the new offerings sort of the long-handle flex-head ratchet which sold very well. One of the things that drives profitability in the Tools Group are the products they make themselves. You see they make tool storage and they make hand tools. And when those are weak, it tends to put a pretty strong \u2013 when those are weak in combination, it puts a pretty strong headwind on their profitability and that\u2019s really what you were seeing in this quarter. You saw some weakness in tool storage, although it wasn\u2019t as weak as the second quarter and you saw weakness in some of the hand tool business. Diagnostics was up because of the ZEUS, but diagnostics the margin shared between the Tools Group and RS&I, so it doesn\u2019t accrue. And that\u2019s what you saw. And you saw, of course, its lower volume. You have volume effects and then you do have the hurricane. So those things combined for that kind of weakness. David MacGregor : What should we be thinking about that business for 4Q and into the first half of '18? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think every quarter is a different situation and I\u2019ll only say that I\u2019ve said for dogs age that the third quarter is kind of squarely and hasn\u2019t any indication of things going forward. I think we feel pretty positive about where the business is going. Tool storage in the SFC it seems as though maybe we\u2019ve kind of saw some of the product prompt [ph] and that\u2019s a very good indication. We\u2019re retooling the Rock \u2018N Roll Cabs. About 50% of them will be retooled by the end of the fourth quarter. And so we see that kind of coming back in that situation. So we\u2019re pretty positive about it, sort of hit a time for tuning and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, refurbishing the product line. That applies a little bit to hand tools. We\u2019re going to be coming out with some new hand tools that will shake people up a little bit and get that restarted. So it all has to do with product. But I think we\u2019re optimistic going forward. David MacGregor : Can you just say if you expect a drag on the Tools segment growth less pronounced with each quarter from this point forward from storage? Nick Pinchuk : It\u2019s hard for me to say that, but I would expect \u2013 I was encouraged by the \u2013 even though the orders were down overall in SFC, I was encouraged by the tool storage results which tends to be a kind of bellwether. Hand tools can move up and hand tools and power tools can move up and down depending on how the bundles are made in the SFC and so on and how people get excited about it. And the franchisees tend to have a broad array of hand tools on their vans and so that can move up and down depending on when you install new products. So I\u2019m pretty optimistic. I think the drag goes down. We\u2019re recovering from the product line [indiscernible] in tool storage and we\u2019re retooling the Rock \u2018N Roll Cabs and I think we have some exciting new products like I talked about coming out. David MacGregor : Great. Last question just on competition. I guess Matco and Mac both talked about adding trucks to their fleet and you\u2019ve talked about holding your truck count constant, because on the surface it would seem that your share is being at less threatened. Can you talk about what Snap-on is doing maybe to defend and even grow its share while your percentage of the industry fleet is being diluted by competitors\u2019 expansion? Nick Pinchuk : It comes down to trying to expand \u2013 enable the vans with new product. New product is the first and foremost. We think we have the best product. ZEUS is the best. ZEUS is going to change everything. In other words, you heard our idea about SureTrack. For example, SureTrack allowed the guy to look at the car and say 92% of the time this was solved by changing the mass airflow sensor. That helps for the high volume. But every once in a while something comes up, it comes up on alternate Tuesdays and it takes forever to fix. Intelligent diagnostic guides them through this like no one else can and so those kind of things help. Secondly, we\u2019re expanding the space on the vans. One of the reasons you see \u2013 in a lot of cases you can see it reflected in franchise finance is that the van drivers are buying or leasing bigger trucks, 20-foot trucks not the 16-foot trucks giving them more retail space. And we believe these kinds of things, better product, more space and then we\u2019re working on helping them with their time so they have more time to sell, that\u2019s what wins for us. Operator : Our next question will come from Liam Burke [FBR Capital]. Liam Burke : Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Liam Burke : Nick, in the C&I division you\u2019ve made some significant investment upfront in emerging markets. Could you give us a little color on the Asia Pacific and what happened during the quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Asia Pacific in the overall results \u2013 the local sales, the sales into the Asia Pacific was up, particularly good quarters in China and India. They\u2019re always mixed. So China and India were good quarters year-over-year. Indonesia was down, for example. But in the region overall, those external sales rose in the quarter. So we\u2019re pleased with that. The sales in supplying the Tools Group principally, basically power tools coming out of the Kunshan factory were down relatively sharply and therefore that tended to overwhelm the growth and it made it down somewhat in the quarter. That\u2019s how that works. So if you\u2019re looking at the local activity, I think a quarter of progress. If you\u2019re looking at it as a supplier to the divisions in the West, principally the Tools Group, it was a down quarter. Liam Burke : Got it, okay. And Nick, you pointed out both inventory and receivables were off based on acquisitions. If you net out acquisitions, would you anticipate those ratios to be normal? Aldo Pagliari : The ratios are fairly similar to the working capital ratios in total for the corporation. What I did say, Liam, is that one day more or less is what impacts DSOs and it relates to the acquisitions. But the inventory turnovers are similar to our core business. Liam Burke : And you wouldn\u2019t anticipate any change with that going forward? I mean within reason. Of course you\u2019ll get quarter-to-quarter variability but --? Aldo Pagliari : Yes, I think as we move forward we look at the opportunities that the inventories present. We expect there to be a return on our inventories. We\u2019re not unwilling to invest in them if we think the returns are there. So I don\u2019t like to get ahead of myself on a conclusion that the inventory is not required, because so far the acquisitions have been performing nicely with respect to our expectations. Liam Burke : Great. Nick Pinchuk : I think we\u2019d say that working capital isn\u2019t necessarily a source of cash going forward. And our overall return on assets when you adjust for the acquisitions, the [indiscernible] is up 80 basis points. So I think we feel okay about that. Now that doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t move. Liam Burke : Great. Thanks, Nick. Thanks, Aldo. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Bret Jordan [Jefferies]. Bret Jordan : Hi. Good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Bret Jordan : To follow up on that Matco and Mac question, are you seeing any increasing price competition out of those guys that they\u2019re building up the franchise base a bit? And I guess how do you see Craftsman entering the market in 2018 obviously with some broader distribution under new ownership? Is that a price competitor or is that just really not in the same product set? Nick Pinchuk : Let me answer them in a reverse order. Craftsman\u2019s been ubiquitous for a long time of course not on a van, but ubiquitous. And people have \u2013 they\u2019ve been in fliers all over the place and every Sunday morning paper, so people are well aware of the price difference. So I don\u2019t see the balance changing with Craftsman. It may work in some instance but those people may not be our customers to begin with. Secondly, for the other guys they\u2019ve been expanding but I\u2019m not hearing competition on price from our franchisees. I don\u2019t hear that. Actually I continue to hear questions turning in on ourselves; gee, this is a great diagnostic unit. It\u2019s better than everybody else. Gee, I\u2019d like to have the power tool with little different features because other people might have those. This was better than \u2013 this wasn\u2019t as good as our old power tool or not enough better than our old power tool. Those are the kinds of things I hear. For tool storage I hear, gee, the tool storage line isn\u2019t catching our imagination. It isn\u2019t getting technicians to come out and say, I got to have that box. By the way I think we had some of that at the SFC. So those are the kinds of things I\u2019m hearing. Now maybe there is that. Of course you would think as Mac and Matco declare better performance they will be gaining \u2013 they will be at least growing their sales and therefore taking business that theoretically could be ours even if it\u2019s maybe not our business to begin with. But I\u2019m not hearing it from the rank and file. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question \u2013 I think Aldo maybe you addressed this, but the U.S. tools growth versus U.S. credit originations growth, did you break out what was in credit what was in the U.S.? It would seem like maybe we\u2019re going to be ticking back up since you\u2019re seeing more strength in some of the high value product? Aldo Pagliari : Growth in originations, if you look at our cash flow statement you\u2019ll see that the finance receivables were down a little over 2%, which is pretty consistent with what you see in the performance of our activity in the United States. So they were fairly similar in that regard. This time of the year we pick up some additional originations at the SFC in particular, the Snap-on Franchise Conference, where we have higher contract receivables. Again, it\u2019s a seasonal item but it was up year-over-year which I find is a nice indicator of the franchisee willingness to invest in their business. So in particular we saw them expanding their investment in vans. In particular, some of them getting new vans which are larger than the old ones and people making upgrades. So I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve gotten an answer to your question, but there were pretty similar I\u2019d say in terms of the performance in quarter. Bret Jordan : And we\u2019d expect maybe a better percentage of high value product sales into the second half of the year, so maybe a tick up on the loan to the mechanic as well? Aldo Pagliari : Well, I\u2019m not going to predict the Q4 mix of sales going forward. Nick said that tool storage orders at the show were positive. If that follows through with sales of tool storage, no doubt Snap-on credit will be a beneficiary. Bret Jordan : Great. Thank you. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Christopher Glynn [Oppenheimer]. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning. Wondering if we could take a look at the Snap-on tools linearity in the quarter. It was kind of interesting. You had the destock in June and then the orders softness at the tradeshow. We heard about maybe less discounting. Did you see a pickup in the normal flow of orders outside the tradeshow as the quarter drew to a close? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, because look I think \u2013 Chris, it\u2019s like at the tradeshow last year, at the \u2013 we don\u2019t call it that. At the Franchise Conference we launched that thermal imager which was incandescent in terms of product. Everybody got excited and we sold a lot of \u2013 remember I said \u2013 I think I might have said that it adds a new version of diagnostics and it sold quite a bit. That was launched at the show. Now we didn\u2019t launch the new ZEUS until after the show, 10 days, two weeks afterwards. So in terms of the product offering, if you just look at diagnostics for one, it wasn\u2019t quite as compelling in the show. We had a number of reasons to do that. But what happened is the ZEUS launched in late August and sold out through September. So you did see a pop from that. And to the extent that diagnostics from the Tools Group was up in the quarter that was on the back of that late selling. And you have all kinds of things around the tool storage. Sometimes the SFC have different offerings that more or less appeal or don\u2019t and people say, okay, I\u2019m going to wait for later to take advantage of some of the products that inevitably comes out on a monthly basis. Christopher Glynn : And are you starting to see any replenishment into the vans on the hand tool side? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think I see nothing that \u2013 I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t see that but I\u2019m saying to you this is an effect that we\u2019re coming off the third quarter. The third quarter is a tough quarter to find any directional idea, because it can result in \u2013 you can have blips with technicians coming back from vacation. Our franchisees to the extent they\u2019ve been doing well take longer vacation and that can create perturbations in the third quarter. So I don\u2019t know. I think we\u2019re positive going forward though. I think we like our product line. We like where we are. We like the reception of the franchisees. We like what they say about the market. So you would think you would see some recovery in that situation. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then delinquency is up and tools not growing right now. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing more volume on collateral resale. Aldo Pagliari : The residual values have been pretty steady. Again, there\u2019s variation and I don\u2019t know if the hurricane is going to cause \u2013 I\u2019m not saying it did in Q3 but it\u2019s going to be harder to repossess things that have been washed away. That could be. But residual values have been pretty steady, Chris. So we don\u2019t see a lot of variation in that. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And lastly you\u2019re not implementing or contemplating any changes to your pricing models? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that going forward. We\u2019re always reviewing situations. For example, steel costs are going upwards. We could look at pricing associated \u2013 we\u2019ve always said we can price for visible steel. We kind of make those kinds of decisions on a regular basis, maybe monthly -- Christopher Glynn : I kind of meant outside the normal reactions to commodity costs and things like that? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t think so. You mean just move our prices up or down? No, I don\u2019t think so. Christopher Glynn : Okay. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll take our last question from Richard Hilgert [Morningstar]. Richard Hilgert : Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Richard Hilgert : Just wanted to follow on to the delinquency question there. We were headed downwards from the December numbers on the delinquency looking to improve a little bit, and then we ticked back up well above the December delinquency rates. And I was just curious, would that cause you to rethink any of your credit policies at this point? Aldo Pagliari : Richard, just a reminder \u2013 this is Aldo. First off, there is always a seasonal effect. The delinquencies tend to creep up in Q3 and Q4 as you approach the holiday season. They intend to improve a bit as people get close to tax refund dates in and around March and April. So there is that underlying seasonal trend. And as what I\u2019m trying to point out, usually you see a creep upwards of about 20 basis points historically in the delinquency metric. This time it\u2019s up 30. So it is up. And we are up year-over-year in terms of to a higher level of delinquency performance. I expect that to kind of continue. It\u2019s been fairly stable looking at factoring off the seasonal trends since Q4. So again, we\u2019re always looking at it. However, this is still pretty good business. If you look at this at a high level, remember it\u2019s there to support sales of the Tools Group principally. 95% of what the credit company does is for the purpose. And Tools Group makes decent margins when they sell tools. And if you look at the yield on these receivables, despite the bad debt in SG&A, it\u2019s a pretty good return to the bottom line. So we look at it but we\u2019re pretty comfortable that it\u2019s performing as expected. Richard Hilgert : Okay, great. On the acquisition dilution, how soon would you expect that dilution to reverse itself and what are the measures that you needed to take in order to do this? Is this a matter of gaining some type of distribution synergies or cost reductions? What are the actions there? Nick Pinchuk : All of the above. Look, here\u2019s the schedule. I think we acquired Car-O-Liner on October 31 of last year, so we\u2019d lap that. So it would go into the base as of October 31. Sturtevant Richmont goes in, in November. So two of the four acquisitions we talk about here will have a partial effect on the fourth quarter and then disappear in January. And then BTC and Norbar were sometime last year. I think Norbar was acquired in May or something like that. So you have that kind of schedule where they cycle off. If you\u2019re talking about how we\u2019re going to improve them with Snap-on value creation, two things. One is of course we acquire for product primarily to give us a position with customers we weren\u2019t accessing or to give us more to sell to either repair shop owners or managers or people in critical industries and they do that, so will gain from selling their products; Norbar to critical industries, Car-O-Liner to repair shop owners or managers and so on. But there\u2019s another factor. Snap-on value creation authors improvement, margin improvement, doing things better everyday like we have in the operations throughout Snap-on. So you\u2019ll see both of those working in tandem in the acquisition. It usually takes a while to get an acquisition on board integrated and then you start finding traction for those processes. Richard Hilgert : Okay, very good. The last question, the SFC you mentioned that the orders for new tool storage equipment, those orders would get filled over time. Have you already ramped up production of the new tool storage equipment or is this a matter of \u2013 it\u2019s going to take time to ramp that up and then get the product out? Nick Pinchuk : It\u2019s not a production problem. But like I said, it\u2019s a long way thing. SFC echoes through several quarters through \u2013 it\u2019s in the third, fourth and end of the first quarter. So we have time to recover depending on what those orders are. And then remember, every month people order and it overlays on top of that, but we don\u2019t see a production problem. Richard Hilgert : So when you go into SFC, you\u2019ve already got the new product that you\u2019re showing at the conference in production and it\u2019s ready for the franchisees to order immediately? Nick Pinchuk : Almost always, but in fact not that much gets ordered immediately. They don\u2019t walk away with tool storage, but they can. So we\u2019re ready for that. We have models that kind of say, this is likely the distribution of these products depending on the particular product, depending on the size of it, depending on the cost. And so we model it in a fairly complex way. So we\u2019re ready to go. Richard Hilgert : Okay, great. Thanks again. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Aldo Pagliari : Have a good day. Operator : That\u2019s all we have for the time we have for questions. So at this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks, Alan, and thanks everyone for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we appreciate your interest in the company. Have a good day. Operator : That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone again for their participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussions. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investor Information. These slides will be archived on our website, along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and conference call slide deck, which can be found on our website. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter and our year and I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the market environment and on progress we've made. After that Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. This is not a typical quarter. There are a number of special non-recurring events that impacted result, the legal charge, and the transition associated with the new tax law. But when you look through all that, Snap-on again showed overall and significant progress along our runways, achieving both growth and profitability. As with most quarters, we had headwinds and we had opportunities. We took advantage of the opportunities and we overcame the headwinds. Overall sales in the quarter were $974.6 million, 9.5% higher than last year, strong. That total included $29.7 million of acquisition-related volume from last year's Car-O-Liner and Sturtevant Richmont operations and this year's BTC and Norbar businesses, and $16.2 million of favorable foreign currency. Our organic growth was 4.3% relatively encouraging with varied results across the groups. Let's start by looking at the non-recurring events. First, the one-time legal charge. A judgment in a pat-related litigation matter that is being appealed. It impacted operating income by $30.9 million and the earnings per share by $0.33. Second, a $7 million or $0.12 EPS charge associated with the implementation in the new U.S. tax legislation. Excluding the legal charge, OpCo operating margin was 19.4% of sales, down 40 basis points, reflecting primarily a 30 basis point dilution from lower margin acquisitions and the impact of favorable foreign currency. For Financial Services, operating income of $54.4 million compared to last year's $51.6 million. As-reported, the EPS was $2.29, but excluding the legal charge and the impact of the tax legislation, earnings per share as-adjusted grew to $2.69, that's an increase of 8.9%. That's our result. And our market, what we believe the automotive repair segments continue to remain favorable, although, we again saw mixed results in that arena, new technologies, aging vehicles, requiring innovative tools and specialized equipment and updated diagnostics and more repairs continue to make that a favorable place to be. As I said though, we had mixed outcomes. Our Tools Group was below trend and in the U.S., looking similar to what we saw in the third quarter, unsatisfying. However, the Repair Systems & Information or RS&I Group continued its considerable advancement serving repair shop owners and managers. From an overview level, we believe the ongoing progress of RS&I, taken together with what we know would be the strong fundamentals clearly indicate that there's ongoing and abundant opportunity available in the segment. Now if you look to Commercial & Industrial \u2013 now our Commercial & Industrial, or C&I Group, it had one of its strongest quarters. Organic sales were up nicely across almost all industries and geographies, including Europe and Asia. Performances in the period from our critical industries focused business with the Industrial Division and SNA Europe, both experiencing strong double-digit growth, were especially encouraging. Within Industrial, an area that's on an upward trend, nearly all segments generated double-digit growth with natural resources, military and general industry leading the way. And SNA Europe's volume in the period was similarly positive again, reflecting gains across almost all geographies. So across the corporation, I'd characterize our markets as mixed, but on the whole, clearly positive. With overall strength in automotive repair, notwithstanding the outcome of our Tools Group and continuing strength in the critical industries and gains across geographies, despite the challenges of the quarter and headwinds will always exist. We remain confident that our businesses are well-positioned to capitalize on the possibilities, on the opportunities that do exist along our runways for growth. And looking ahead, we also see clear runways for improvement. We said this many times. Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI driving, ongoing and significant advancements as they have for some time. Now for the full-year, sales of $3.69 billion represented an as-reported increase of 7.5%. The organic volume gain was 3.4%, with the RS&I Group up 7.6%, the C&I Group rising 4.5%, and the Tools Group roughly flat. As-reported EPS for the year was $9.52, but excluding the legal matters and the impact of the tax legislation, earnings per share as-adjusted reached $10.12, that's an increase of 10%. OpCo OI percent as-adjusted was 19.3%, up 20 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points dilutive impact from acquisition and a decrease of 20 basis points associated with unfavorable currency. And when we include the income from Financial Services of $217.5 million, which rose $18.8 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation as-adjusted was 23.2%, up a similar 20 basis points, the quarter and the year, sales gains and profit increases, taking advantage of opportunities on our runways for growth and driving down our runways for improvement. Now, let's move to the individual operating groups and their fourth quarter results. The Tools Group. Organic sales down 3% and operating earnings of $67.3 million, representing a margin rate of 16.4%, down 120 basis points. We do believe our actions to reinvigorate the van channel sales will be effective, but they didn't create improvement in the fourth quarter. In the quarter and throughout the year, however, the Tools Group did confirm the strength and the market-leading position of its van network. It wasn't evident in the recent financials, but it was clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. The franchisees are strong and the turnover is low and that positivity was once again acknowledged by multiple publications, listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice. And just this past quarter, Snap-on was ranked among the top franchise organizations, both in the U.S. and abroad. We were again recognized by Franchise Business Review, which collects franchisee's satisfaction data. And in its latest ranking, lists as Snap-on as a Top 50 franchise, marking the 11th consecutive year we received that award based on satisfaction. We were also once again recognized by the Military Times, which includes Snap-on on its Best for Vets annual ranking, coming in at number five for the second year in a row and the only mobile tool franchise on the entire list. And abroad, Snap-on was ranked number two in the Elite Franchise magazine's Top UK franchises for 2018, finishing above many UK-only franchises and ahead of some very popular global brands. Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of the franchisees in our van business and it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products. And in 2017, once again, the Tools Group increased its number of hit products, those $1 million sellers developed from direct observations gained in the field that I think you've become familiar with. Tool Storage sales were still a shortfall in the quarter, but we're taking action. You heard me speak of migrating some premium options like the PowerDrawer, the speed organizer into our lower ranges, we're doing that. We're introducing new features and new themes. We're retooling the Rock N' Roll vans and we'll be expanding our line with a model that offers attractive capacity in a compact footprint, some high-end features at a price that's affordable to young technicians. A unit aimed at making them Snap-on customers for life and contributing to a restart for the Tools Group. And just in December, probably too late to affect the fourth quarter, we introduced our new series of 12-point high-performance ratcheting box wrenches, whole form gears, proprietary steel for durability, extended handle for leverage, 8-tooth pole to minimize the swing arc, another unique tool reducing technician job time, particularly in difficult and critical situations. The Tools Group may be below trends, but we keep building its strength with new product and network vitality, well that's the Tools Group. Now let's move to RS&I. Volume in the fourth quarter was $356.8 million, with an organic rise of 6.2%. Double-digit sales gains in the OEM dealerships and low single-digit increases in diagnostics and repair information products. Operating earnings of $89.8 million, increased $7.3 million for an OI margin of 25.2%, down 60 basis points from last year, but with a 50 basis point decline from lower margin acquisitions and negative currency effects. Once again, we saw some compelling products, giving us more to sell to those repair shop owners and managers, offerings like the NEXIQ Blue-Link Mini, our electronic logging device. It won a Professional Tool and Equipment Innovation of the Year Award at the SEMA show in Las Vegas. The Blue-Link Mini logs driver hours, vehicle movement, engine hours, vehicle performance data like, and vehicle performance data like speed and miles per gallon. All of that allows heavy-duty customers to meet the electronic data logging regulation that took effect in December. And it appears to be a winning product with great customer reception. We saw that. Our diagnostics and repair information businesses were also led by new products. We mentioned last quarter, the launch of our game-changing handheld intelligent diagnostics, the ZEUS. Well, it's selling well. Hardware and software subscriptions, yes, subscriptions, a new focus for one of our introductions. A great unit raising the bar in advanced repair, and helping to offset the difficult comparison of last year's fourth quarter, both in the launch of the MODIS Edge handheld and our very popular Thermal Imager in that category. RS&I also advanced in its position in the repair information space, the Mitchell 1 business, enhancing our ProDemand software by adding a new user interface. It takes repair information to a whole new level of intelligence with advanced search technology that scans the vast Mitchell 1 database and returns exactly the specific information the technician needs for that particular job. OEM data and Snap-on's proprietary SureTrack real-world data, real-world information is now more tightly integrated and the new interface amplifies the power of that combination. It makes the technician's diagnosis job easier, quicker and more accurate. Finally in the period, RS&I's equipment division introduced the new V2100 imaging wheel aligner. It's targeted squarely at meeting the needs of independent shops that work on a multiple brands of vehicles and perform a variety of repair services. Those shops typically can't have a dedicated alignment guy. They just don't do that many alignments. What they do need is an ease-of-use mid-tier unit. Different vehicle brands have varying alignment procedures. It's a major challenge for a general tech. Well, the V2100 is the right unit within an intuitive interface that will guide through the multiple approaches to align with clarity. For a general tech, it reduces alignment time by 30%, a great saving and a nice boost to our equipment lineup. We keep driving to expand RS&I's position with the repair shop owners and managers, offering new products to sell, developed by our customer connection and innovation processes or added by our strategic and coherent acquisitions. And you can see it in the numbers. Now, on to C&I. Sales increased in the period 19.4% from 2016, helped by \u2013 I want to say that again \u2013 sales increased in the period 19.4% from 2016, helped by $19.1 million in acquisition-related volume and $6.8 million of favorable currency. Organic sales were up 10.1%, among the highest we've ever seen at C&I. That year record increase reflects improvements from almost every operating division, including gains by Industrial, SNA Europe, Power Tools and the Asia-Pacific division. The group's operating income was $50.9 million. That's up from the $43.9 million reported last year. Operating income margin was 14.9%, down 40 basis points, but reflecting a 50 basis point impact from the acquisitions, dilutive acquisitions, and another 50 basis point decline from unfavorable currency. In fact, those impacts notwithstanding, 14.9% is among the highest margins we've seen for the group in the last several years, last four years or so. In effect, C&I had one of its strongest quarters. Reassuringly, SNA Europe again posted increased organic sales, up double-digits, continuing its progress, now 17 quarters in a row of year-over-year growth and profit climbed right along, up 19 straight quarters. 19 quarters in a row of profitability improvement, reflecting Snap-on Value Creation at work with innovative new products and improved new processes, driving positive trends and some pretty challenging geographies. Also in C&I, our Industrial division made encouraging strides. As I mentioned before, strong double-digit growth, driven in part by our strong double-digit growth for our Industrial division, driven in part by a widening array of new products. Having been up and down in recent periods, aerospace showed good progress in the quarter, rising worldwide. First time in a while, we vision both in domestic and international on a boost from customer connection, authoring products like our new cordless grease gun kit. Many planes have service requirements, which prohibit them from using this industry standard units with customer connection Snap-on developed a new gun, which limits the grease delivery pressure, matching a special aircraft requirements. And based on further customer connection, we also added improvements like an extended length pressure hose, giving technicians that added reach to reach and service landing gear and a clear grease cartridge tube, allowing users to quickly identify the type of material in the gun. Now these are, seem like simple improvements and they are, but they're quite effective in making critical work easier in special aerospace situations. Just like in the Industrial division, SNA Europe has also been using customer connection and innovation to drive its continuing expansion. For example, in the critical power generation industry in Europe, with a significant amount of oil in Northern Europe being pumped from offshore, there was opportunity for a special tool kit for servicing the individual ocean rigs. Customer connection, observing the environment and tasks led to the development of what we're calling the pump-man tool kit, combining bottles tools at height with safe when you use them at height with the safety suspenders and with our large array of \u2013 combining those tools at height with a large array of our non-sparking tools, eliminating fire hazards and addressing the service and safety needs for the critical oil rig environment. The specialized kits \u2013 these specialized pump-man kits were released just this year, but based on early receptions, we believe will be a big driver for our expansion in the oil and gas industry and a great help in continuing SNA Europe's upward trajectory. Power Tools division returned to growth in the quarter and new product paved the way. One winner was our new CDRR761, a 14.4 volt, 3/8 inches, MicroLithium right-angle drill, lightweight, provides up to 150-inch pounds of torque, offers two-speed ranges at a variable speed switch. It's great for driving screws with control. It was launched to help technicians get into small tight spaces under \u2013 like under the dash and on the firewall and it has an integrated LED light to illuminate that dark work. It was introduced in the fourth quarter and it's already $1 million seller, one of our hit products that drive growth. Well, that's our fourth quarter. OpCo organic sales rising 4.3%. Progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement. Tools Group, working on regaining growth. RS&I continuing its considerable strength and C&I starting to show its potential with much more to go. All of it driving a 19.4% adjusted operating margin, despite the dilutive acquisition and an as-adjusted EPS of $2.69, up 8.9%. That's our fourth quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $974.6 million in the quarter increased 9.5%, reflecting a 4.3% organic sales gains, $29.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $16.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The year-over-year organic sales growth, which was the highest level achieved of any quarter in 2017, reflects ongoing progress in serving repair shop owners and managers in the vehicle repair sector as well as broad-based growth in the businesses that comprise the Commercial & Industrial segment. Consolidated gross margin of 47.7% declined 220 basis points, primarily due to higher sales of lower gross margin products, 60 basis points of lower gross margins on an acquisition-related sales and 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. The operating expense margin of 31.5% increased 140 basis points as 320 basis points related to the legal charge that, as Nick has mentioned, is being appealed. These were partially offset by benefits from sales volume leverage and a 40 basis point benefit from operating expenses for acquisitions. Operating earnings before Financial Services of $157.7 million or 16.2% of sales, includes the legal charge and compares to $176.1 million or 19.8% of sales in the prior year. Excluding the legal charge, operating earnings before Financial Services, as-adjusted was $188.6 million or 19.4% of sales. Financial Services revenue of $79.9 million and operating earnings of $54.4 million increased $5.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively from 2016. Consolidated operating earnings of $212.1 million or 20.1% of revenues compared to $227.7 million or 23.6% of revenues a year ago. Excluding the legal charge, consolidated operating earnings as-adjusted was $243.0 million or 23.0% of revenues. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 33.0% was reduced by 120 basis points as a result of the legal charge, but increased by 360 basis points as a result of a $7 million charge related to the implementation of the new tax legislation in the United States. This tax charge includes an estimated transition tax, an unremitted foreign earnings of $13.7 million, partially offset by an estimated tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities of $6.7 million. Excluding both the legal and tax charges, the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 as-adjusted was 30.6% as compared to 30.8% in Q4 of 2016. Finally, net earnings of $129.5 million or $2.24 per diluted share compared to $146.3 million or $2.47 per share a year ago. Excluding the legal charge and tax charge, net earnings as-adjusted was $155.6 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.69, represented an increase of 8.9%. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on slide 7. Sales of $341.7 million in the quarter increased 19.4%, reflecting a 10.1% organic sales gain, $19.1 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in European-based hand tools business as well as low single-digit gains in both the segments Power Tools and Asia-Pacific operations. The gains in critical industries were positive across the board, including strong growth in international aviation and the military, two areas, which were weaker earlier in the year. Gross margin of 39.2% declined 110 basis points from 40.3% a year ago due to higher sales of lower gross margin products and 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 24.3% improved 70 basis points, primarily due to the benefits of sales volume leverage, partially offset by 50 basis points of operating expenses related to our acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.9 million increased 15.9% and the operating margin of 14.9% compared to 15.3% a year ago, including the 100 basis point impact from currency and acquisitions mentioned above. Turning now to slide 8. Sales in the Tools Group of $409.2 million decreased 2%, reflecting a 3% organic sales decline, partially offset by $4.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease includes a mid-single digit decline in the U.S., which was only partially offset by a mid-single digit sales gain internationally. Gross margin of 41.4% decreased 60 basis points year-over-year due to the lower volume in related cost. The operating expense margin of 25% increased 60 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the effect of the lower sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $67.3 million, decreased 8.4% and the operating margin of 16.4% compared to 17.6% in 2016. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $356.8 million increased 11.6%, reflecting a 6.2% organic sales gain, $10.6 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflected a double-digit gain in sales to OEM dealerships and a low single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products. Gross margin of 45.4% declined 240 basis points as a 110 basis point impact from acquisitions, higher sales of lower gross margin products and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 20.2% improved 180 basis points due to the higher sales volume and 80 basis points of benefits from acquisitions, partially offset by 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $89.8 million increased 8.8% from prior year levels. The operating margin of 25.2% compared to 25.8% last year, including a 30 basis point impact from acquisitions. Now turning to slide 10. Operating earnings from Financial Services of $54.4 million on revenue of $79.9 million compared to operating earnings of $51.6 million on revenue of $74.2 million a year ago. Financial Services expenses of $25.5 million increased $2.9 million, primarily due to a $2.4 million year-over-year increase in provisions for losses on finance receivables, which totaled $16.0 million in the quarter. This is up $3.2 million sequentially from $12.8 million in the third quarter of 2017 and compares to third to fourth quarter sequential increase in the prior year of $2.8 million. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.3% in both the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016. In the fourth quarter, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.8% in 2017, compared to 18.2% in 2016 due in part to the portfolio mix as well as higher percentage of originations utilizing marketing rebates in 2017. Respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% and 9.3%. Total loan originations of $265 million in the fourth quarter increased $4.7 million or 1.8% year-over-year. As higher originations of contract receivables principally franchise finance were partially offset by a decline in finance receivable originations due to the lower year-over-year sales of big-ticket items in the U.S. by the Snap-on Tools Group. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.74 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross Financial Services portfolio grew $28.1 million or 1.4% in the fourth quarter. As for finance portfolio losses and delinquency trends, they are, as expected, tracking higher year-over-year, similar to what we've seen over the last several quarters and also reflecting typical seasonal increases. We believe these, trends however, continue to support our view over an appropriate risk reward balance in this segment of our business. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12- month losses of $46.7 million, represented 2.92% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 61 basis points year-over-year and 15 basis points sequentially. The 60-plus day delinquency rate of 1.9% for U.S. extended credit increased 20 basis points sequentially typical of the seasonal increase from the third quarter to fourth quarter. Overall, operating earnings in the Financial Services segment rose 5.4% year-over-year. Their allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the above-mentioned trends in the portfolio's performance. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $193.5 million in the quarter increased $41.8 million from comparable 2016 levels, due primarily to lower discretionary pension contributions and cash paid for income taxes in 2017. Net cash used by investing activities of $59.0 million included net additions to finance receivables of $38.2 million, down from $53.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures of $24.7 million in the quarter compared with $17.7 million last year. Net cash used by financing activities of $136.6 million included dividend payments to shareholders of $46.4 million and the repurchase of 472,000 shares of common stock for $75.3 million under our existing share repurchase programs. Full-year 2017 share repurchases totaled 1.82 million shares for $287.9 million. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $76.8 million from 2016 year-end levels, primarily due to higher sales, $21.7 million of foreign currency translation and $9.5 million from acquisitions. Days sales outstanding of 66 days was up from 63 days a year ago, but down from 67 days at the end of the third quarter. Inventories increased $108.3 million from 2016 year-end, primarily to support increased customer demand in certain segments and new product introductions. Foreign currency translation and acquisitions contributed $23.9 million and $5.7 million of the increase, respectively. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.2 compared to 3.3 at year-end 2016. Inventories decreased approximately $11 million from the end of the third quarter. Our year-end cash position of $92 million increased $14.4 million from 2016 year-end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio increased to 27.0% from 26.3% year-over-year. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter-end, we had $151 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2018. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. As a result of the recently enacted tax legislation in the United States, we currently anticipate that our full-year 2018 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 24% to 25%. This compares to a full-year 2017 effective tax rate on a reported and on an adjusted basis of 31.1% and 30.6%, respectively. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Aldo. Well, I started by saying that we were encouraged but unsatisfied in the quarter and we were. The Tools Group remain below trend, not yet recovering, but we continue to have confidence in the market and in our inherent strengths. We do have a strong franchise network. The turnover and our franchisee health metrics say so. And we are investing in new products and support to restart the growth engine. You can see it in the ZEUS, revolutionizing vehicle diagnostics and moving us further into subscription-based software. But despite the Tools Group challenges, we overcame again. Organic sales growth was 4.3% and the as-reported number was 9.5%. The RS&I Group and the C&I Group both had strong quarters. RS&I as-reported growth, 11.6% organic and inorganic gain of 6.2% and OI margin 25.2%, a significant contribution to our performance. C&I had a near-record quarter, rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage with success. As-reported sales of 19.4% and an organic increase at 10.1%, OI margin of 14.9% among the group's highest. The results in the quarter I think clearly demonstrate that our coherent runways for growth, expanding with repair shop owners and managers and extending to critical industries are wide with abundant opportunities, and we're confident we have the strength and the position all along our runways for further growth \u2013 all along our runways. We have the strength and position for further growth and more improvement amplified by the new tax rates to maintain our positive performance trajectory as we move through 2018 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. The performance of our fourth quarter and of the year and our clear opportunities going forward would not be possible without your extraordinary contributions. For your ongoing achievements, you have my congratulations, and for your continuing dedication and commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We'll go first to Liam Burke with B. Riley FBR. Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Yes, thank you. Good morning, Nick. Good morning, Aldo. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Hey, Liam. Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Nick, in the core Snap-on Tools Group, you highlighted the fact that storage sales were down again. But how did the core hand tool business fare this quarter on the year-over-year basis? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Well, the hand tool business was I think improved from the fourth quarter, but it's still down some. And we're still suffering I think the results of maybe the less than overwhelming offerings, coming out of the SFC. So, we're seeing an improvement, but not where we want it to be. The big factor, the good news in the quarter I think is associated with the ZEUS, the effect of the ZEUS and its sale off the vans, which is very encouraging for us. That's the silver lining in the quarter, I think. But in general, we still got to keep working on the Tools Group, new product, new support. Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Okay. And on a free cash flow basis, Aldo, you're up about 35%. Does that change your capital allocation outlook? You went through a good part of your buyback authorization. Does that become an increasing part of your capital allocation strategy? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Certainly. The share repurchase is part of our allocation strategy, but I think our priorities remain the same, Liam. We have good access to capital markets, the new tax action provide more cash generation opportunities, but serving organic sales and then M&A opportunities still becomes the two most important items on the list, but certainly share repurchase, dividend strategy, pension contributions factor into that decision as well. Liam Burke - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Aldo. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks, Liam. Operator : Next is David MacGregor at Longbow Research. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Yes. Good morning. Do you hear me okay? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Okay. Great. A couple of questions. First of all, just on the C&I, pretty remarkable organic growth. It's nice to see you follow \u2013 sort of firing on all the cylinders. I guess the question is just how sustainable is it? And just talk about \u2013 I know you don't provide quantitative outlook and guidance on your head, but if you could just talk about how sustainable that organic growth might be, given the strength you're seeing in critical industries and European hand tools? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Look, I think you can look at it this way. I believe that SNA Europe was up double-digits and you might not say double-digit every quarter, but I think we said in our thing, it's been up 17 quarters in a row in terms of sales; and 19 quarters in a row in terms of profit. And we think it's still got considerable headroom. It's still not back to where it was prerecession. So it took a big dip in a recession and we keep making it stronger, so we're positive about SNA Europe and I think we have abundant demonstration of that. The Industrial business is now through the downturn in the industrial sector in oil and gas and others. We kept investing in new product and our understanding of marketplace and I think you're seeing that come to fruition. Now I'm not going to say until you see those two big cylinders, I think working, based on improved capabilities that you can see coming through in the results to us. Now whether that's going to offer double-digit growth or not, is another question. I think we prefer to say that we look at our growth on an organic basis at 4% to 6% and we see C&I at the top end of that, but it appears as though in this environment with the strength we have, we got two big pistons there. And the other place, Asia-Pacific, had pretty good growth particularly in China and in India, in turbulent markets, I would say. And Power Tools came back, so I think you'd say C&I has positioned pretty well and the numbers showing that. If you take a look at those numbers, this is what we meant by rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : Well, congratulations on all the progress there. I guess my second question was on the Tools segment and just if you could talk about franchisee order patterns through the quarter and what was changing there. I know your contract receivables are up, and you talked about that being driven by franchisee sales. Is your sense that inventories are maybe up a little, accumulating within the franchise network? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Actually no. I don't think the inventories are accumulated. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: The contract receivables, David, are up principally because of the launch of new vans and the franchised channel, so a lot of franchisees have upped the size of their advance they're putting on the street, and that's one of the key drivers in franchise finance. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: We would say the opposite actually that, if anything that we don't have perfect visibility on this. If anything, the franchisees inventories are coming down a little bit. I think the principal component of the franchisee story is the ZEUS. The ZEUS is selling well off the van and I don't know if the import of my remarks hits, but the franchisees are selling this big revolutionary new ZEUS at higher levels than we've seen for a large unit and they are selling what we call a data package, which is three years of subscriptions. We never really sold subscriptions with a launch before, and that's happening at record level. So I think if you look at the franchise interface level, one of the real great stories is around that revolutionary diagnostic, which is changing the industry, recognizes the market leader and is pulling us more into subscriptions-based software. Now when you do this kind of thing, it doesn't always register for the Tools Group right away, because the franchisees sell for three year subscription boom and it gets financed or sold in other way. And we, in the Tools Group, recognize on an amortized basis over the month. So they see that kind of thing, but if you look at that level, the franchisees are pretty happy about this. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : And last question for me is just on the Tools business. You talked about the gross margin pressure there and I appreciate you breaking it out for us. To what extent, this promotional pressure or promotional programs sort of a headwind on gross margins, and if you could tie that in with just some commentary around the general competitive environment tools that would be helpful? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: I'll say it this way. Look, I'll say it this way. Look, the Tools Group volume is down. They're vertically integrated, so you know that's going to play out in some kind of loss margin plus absorption and that kind of situation; but also, they want volume. If you're in the position of the Tools Group, if you want volume and so they're working pretty hard to take advantage of every possible piece of daylight they can. That's not the most efficient way to sell. David S. MacGregor - Longbow Research LLC : All right. Thank you. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Gary Prestopino with Barrington. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Good morning Gary. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Nick, on the Tool Storage area, I mean, how far are you on the product refresh that I think you \u2013 we had talked about couple of quarter \u2013 over the last couple of quarters, then you mentioned it a little in your earlier comments. I mean are you basically done with that product refresh? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: I ain't done at all. I'm not done, but we were \u2013 we brought out some stuff. I think I said in the \u2013 some different themes and some different features and we migrated some features down into smaller \u2013 into the \u2013 some of the middle \u2013 mid-tier line, and we're continuing to do that. And I think we continue to make changes associated with the Tool Storage, because we think it didn't move \u2013 what happens to it, Gary, it didn't move this quarter. Some of that stuff worked, but not enough to move the overall needle, so you keep bringing out new stuff to try to make sure you can make the change. I think one of the things we're kind of encouraged about is this entry-level thing for the technicians, which we're kind of focused on in this situation. We're kind of \u2013 we're seeing some reasonable effects at the top end of the line and then \u2013 so we'd like to get these guys to \u2013 at the lower end with a little more activity. So you're seeing some of that. Then you go back to the Rock N' Roll Cabs. The Rock N' Roll Cabs, we're refurbishing them and we finished the first half of that refurbishment program right at the end of the year, so they really weren't \u2013 if you look at it, they really weren't on the road. And we expect to get the other half finished in another quarter, let's say, for government work. So you'll see those rolling out. So I don't \u2013 if you're looking for me to tell you when the thing is going to turn around, I guess I can't, but I have every confidence we can do this. And the reason I do this is because, when you look at our van network, you talk to our franchisees, you see our product line, pretty strong. Now we have gaps and it's caused us some difficulty, but the Tools Group, each one of our groups go up and down like this and we bring them back. I think the thing about the quarter is, is for the second quarter in a row, the Tools Group had difficulty and we achieved anyway because we had great quarters with RS&I and C&I. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: No, no. I understand and get it. No, I'm just trying to try and get an idea of when we could see an inflection point in the Tools Group? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think, I said, the meaning of my word unsatisfied is this, Gary. We expect to grow every quarter. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Right. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: And so, we don't grow in one of these divisions, while there is the possibility of having a difficult quarter, we're not satisfied. So our expectation would be to grow, but I can't \u2013 in terms of forecasting for a financial situation, I can't be saying that we're doing that, but I can tell you internally, we're looking for it. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: And then what \u2013 in terms of refurbishing the van, the Rock N' Roll, vans, cabs. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: What are you doing there? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: First of all, you start from the outside in. You make the outside look differently, you do different wraps. You go inside, you reorganize the structure of the vans themselves, you put new stuff on, you organize a more robust refreshment of the Tool Storage boxes on the van, you try to make sure you have different examples, and we install a new computer system, which will \u2013 a new 3D modeling system, which if you doesn't see it on the van, or you see it on the van and you like a different color, you get a great picture of it. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: So, we do those kinds of things. It's really to try to make it seem different, so when the technician gets on the van, he says, oh, this is different I want to take a look at this stuff. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then getting back to the ZEUS, which is interesting. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Yeah. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Is this a federal \u2013 what is it, a federal regulation now that you have to monitor your mileage or something? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: No, no, no. Sorry, I probably confused you on this. The ZEUS, I was talking about the NEXIQ Blue-Link Mini. It's an electronic data logging. That's in the heavy-duty business that you put on trucks that monitor the daily log. There was legislation that took place that took effect in December, which drove that sales. ZEUS is for, your average vehicles in your \u2013 in Bimmer's auto repair, down in Illinois or something like that, or a muffler shop. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Sure. Gary Frank Prestopino - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.: All right. Thanks. Operator : The next to David Leiker with Baird. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. This is Joe Vruwink for David. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Hello. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I was hoping to peel back the onion a bit more on the Tools Group. So if I look at finance receivable originations, and that's my proxy for big-ticket product sales, that was down 1% to get to Tools Group of down 3%, it means the core hand tool, power tool business, let's call it, was down 4% and that down 4% is a weaker number than it's been tracking all year long. So I'm just wondering within Q4, what trends did you see that might explain maybe a weakening or I'm wondering since we're talking about the ZEUS, are your franchisees spending more time selling ZEUS and maybe less time selling Tools and that might be getting caught up in this number? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Let's just talk about this for a minute. As you know, I know you know this well. There isn't a perfect linkage between the Tools Group sales and originations. One thing, there is a time lag, probably the stuff that's originated in the fourth quarter, some significant portion of that got sold by us in the third quarter, that's one thing, I think. Clear, you know this. The work that gets into the van, they got to sell it and so on. That's one thing. And ZEUS introduced a new wrinkle for this. ZEUS is two pieces. It is the hardware itself, revolutionizing, intelligent diagnostics, faster stream, better color resolution, all that stuff and then it's a software package, a data software package underneath the intelligent diagnostic. Well, the data software package sells for thousands of dollars because it's three years and that gets financed, but it doesn't get recognized at the Tools Group, except on a monthly basis, amortized like a subscription. So not only is there \u2013 is this new wrinkle introduced by ZEUS, and that you have franchisees financing something, which doesn't really get recognized as immediately by a sale, by the Tools Group because it's the subscription-based software. We think it's a great situation because we're going to subscription base, that creates some of that disconnect. And so, I think you could talk to us a little more extensively and we can talk about this a little bit more and go through it, that's number one. Number two is your point is well taken though, I think. The ZEUS is a very expensive unit and we do have to take a lot of effort in training the franchisees and having our diagnostics, our 130 diagnostic systems developers and the Techno van supporting them and it takes a lot of effort to sell it. So a successful ZEUS sale can be drawing attention from other things, that's true. It's hard to quantify that though, Joe, you know. But that does happen. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. The point on software sales, that makes a lot of sense. Maybe if I spin the question around a little bit. So, U.S. down mid single-digits. That was a consistent number as in Q3. Obviously, tool storage has been weak. We've talked about that, but in thinking about the core mechanic customer, what is your sense on just the backdrop there whether the BLS has data, it shows hours worked up, hiring up, earnings way up. It would seems like that customer is able to buy more tools. What is your sense on Snap-on's ability to tap into what is ultimately a pretty strong, I'll call it, wallet growth? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: I agree. That's why I'm saying the automotive repair market is a robust market with abundant opportunity that we can drive down. We think we have the capability to do it. I mean, I think the fact that we're selling the ZEUSs in pretty good numbers, basically last year, we had a boffo quarter with the thermal imager. You know what, we sold a lot of them in the fourth quarter and at the franchisee level, they're overcoming that with ZEUS. And so what you got is people are playing the ZEUS list price, some people have looked at it, all-in is like $17,000. Now that's like a car price. There's a lot of versions of that, that gets sold, but it's thousands of dollars, and we're selling it successfully. So we're able to tap into it I think if we have the right product. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And you think recent, you've talked about coming out of the franchise conference, that product introduction, but have there been other items launched in the back half of the year? We're entering Q1 or we're over a month into Q1, what have been more recent trends than just that undertaking around new products? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: That's why I put the power tool in the script. The power tool that we talked about, that 3/8 inch mini power tool right angle drill sold out right away and it became a $1 million seller, a hit product. So we are launching products. Our problem is, we're not selling enough tool storage, and there are other issues, but the thing is that, we need to turn around tool storage. That's what I think. Now there are other things we'd like to see go better. So we are seeing encouraging. When we have the product, we believe we sell it. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: And then my last question, A lot of our focus over the past year has been on finance receivables, but let's maybe talk about contract receivables. How much of the asset book is that category? And then can you just segment of contract receivables, how much is maybe more of a commercial loan with the shop? How much is going to be van leases? And are the growth in van leases going on right now? Is that historically a leading indicator of future activity or anything you can kind of foot to for why franchisees are reinvesting right now? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: Joe, actually, there's not a lot to be gleaned. The mix within the portfolio has been rather constant. If you look at the end of Q4, 81% of the portfolio is extended credit, 15% is franchise finance and 3% is to leases of equipment to shop owners. That vacillates between 3% and 4% over the years. The franchise finance goes from 13.5% to 15.5%, so it's kind of all within range. I think it's a sign of prosperity and confidence when you see the franchisees up into a new van, particularly a larger van. I think they wouldn't make an investment like that if they didn't show their commitment to the future and want to keep growing their business. Joe D. Vruwink - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. I think last year, maybe a couple of phases you tightened credit a little bit. Just wondering what the results, learnings were around that, what the latest toggles are if that subsequently yielded to some opportunity to lose some credit backup perhaps? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: I think we look at credit each and every quarter, a little bit harder at certain times of the year than others, Chris. It evolves, but not big movements in terms of decision making, we're always trying to tweak the portfolio in a positive way, try to put our franchisees and ourselves in a better place. Try to make sure we match our customers' needs up with what we were offering. So loosening credit, I wouldn't say that per se. I think we're judicious in terms of how we counsel the franchisees and approaching the situation. Having said that, one of the callers earlier made the comment that I think mechanics' wallets are getting bigger. I think that means that there probably is more capacity over time. We were trying to identify where that credit capacity is and loan to those mechanics. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then on the core vans channel, wondering if you're seeing any apparent rebalancing in the vans channel marketplace around historical price spreads around the few key competitors and maybe any changes on the relative under-penetration of some of your stronger peers? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Look, certainly if you looked at our numbers and you looked at some of the other numbers, you would conclude there's some change. We don't hear it from our franchisees. We don't hear them saying, oh, by the way, I have trouble competing with this guy or that guy over a particular product. So to the extent other people are growing, I guess you could argue that they're making inroads, where we could have had those inroads, but, or had that business. But you don't hear at the level. Nobody comes up and says, boy, you got to match this or we got to do this, or this is giving me problems. You don't hear it. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just final, bookkeeping, if you told us I missed it, but what's the finance receivables allowance balance down the year? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: The balance is about 3% of the portfolio, if you look at the coverage ratio. Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Okay. Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: A little bit more. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.: If we move to the next question please. Operator : Pardon me. Thank you. We'll go next to Scott Stember with C.L. King. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Good morning. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Most of my questions have been answered, but I have one question. Nick, you had referred to the SFC, and I guess you're referring to the big pack of tools and maybe some bundling or unbundling that didn't go well, I guess from a pricing and just the actual packaging. Could you talk about what you've done to remedy that? And how long would we take to see that with an improved numbers within the Tools Group? Thank you very much. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Look, I think, yeah, the thing is that generally hand tools are something which are a little different than tool storage or diagnostics or anything else. The hand tools inventory is fairly ubiquitous on the van itself. They have a lot of handles, but generally, they have to be \u2013 you have to attract them to a bundle. It didn't work so well, some people took it in the SFC. We've tried to counter that by bringing out some tools, that's why I talked some individual tools that would be attractive. So, when I talked about the ratcheting wrenches and the specific high-durability ratcheting wrench that gets into certain small spaces, that's the kind of thing we're doing. And remember, I could have talked for the whole call about those kinds of things and so that's what we're trying to do to try to restart that. I think if you're dangerous, if you're looking at any one quarter at any particular group, because you do even in the good \u2013 when they were growing like a 7%, you saw ups and downs in those things so you can't necessarily conclude that hand tools because it's up and down, would be in trouble in terms of a tool category or be wanting in any way, we just didn't quite have the right package and we're trying to restart that with new product. Scott L. Stember - C.L. King & Associates, Inc.: Got it. That's all I have. Thank you. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Next to Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Hi. Good morning, guys. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Good morning. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Are you seeing any kind of a market share struggle, I guess. I mean, the question was kind of asked earlier. I have heard from mechanics and some of your other franchise peers are being aggressive on pricing at the shop level. And is that something that you're hearing at all from your franchisees? Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: You know from the \u2013 Bret, from the 80,000 foot level, you would say, we must be seeing something like that, if other people are growing faster than you are. I don't know if the mechanisms for that competition are price or what, but when I ride and I was just on a van the other day and guy never mentioned Mac or Matco, or any other competition. Now of course, he is talking to me and you can argue this, but I do meet with these guys a lot and often, they're just talking about ourselves, we could have \u2013 we could use different tool storage. We could use a new model in tool storage to address this kind of thing. We like the ZEUS. It takes \u2013 we're enthusiastic about the ZEUS. The feedback I get is all associated with ourselves. So I don't think we're feeling something that other people are doing other than maybe we're not doing as well as we could do versus what we expect of ourselves, that's the difference, I think. Really. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: I think the Snap-on franchise \u2013 you ask people about the preferred form of hand tool, that seems rock solid. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. And then a housekeeping. On rates, would you expect and I guess the rates were down and maybe I think Aldo mentioned some promotional issues on the quarter on the funding rate, but would you expect rate to be up going forward just given the increasing rate environment? Or do you think we're still sort of \u2013 we're going to be kind of flat? Aldo J. Pagliari - Snap-On, Inc.: I think they stay, Bret. It wasn't by a couple promotions. The products that fascinated the customer is what we call featured products. Featured products usually have rebates associated with them. That marketing expense comes off of the interest income that we calculate and the uptake on those was just better than what it had been in Q4 of last year. So you get a little bit of a depressant effect. And then the mix in the portfolio tend to be a little bit better quality credit and a lot of the shop owners with the ZEUS that Nick mentioned, the principal buyers of that are pretty good credit quality customers that drives the rate in the portfolio down a bit. So it depends on the mix of those. To answer your question, I think it stays in the 17% to 18% range on a holistic basis for finance receivables. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC : Okay. Great. Thank you. I appreciated it. Nicholas T. Pinchuk - Snap-On, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back to Leslie Kratcoski for any closing remarks. Leslie H. Kratcoski - Snap-On, Inc.: Thanks for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we appreciate your interest in the company. Good day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks Leslie. Good morning everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our quarter and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we've made, and what we believe it all means. And then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. We believe that our first quarter again demonstrated Snap-On's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming significant headwinds, and period-to-period variations. We're encouraged by the quarter. Something -- like every quarter, I suppose, but something did not go as we would like. The Tools Group remained below trend and some segments and some geographies saw a down period. But once again, our strength overcame, our core hand tools, and the van network, and in Europe, and in segments like the military and general industry was strong. And then our very different products, software, also showed significant progress across our businesses, and that general combination overcame the turbulence and moved us forward again. Our reported sales in the quarter were $935.5 million were up of 5.5%, including $26.9 million of favorable foreign exchange, $14.3 million of acquisition-related sales, and $7.2 million or 8% organic gain. EPS was $2.82 and that included a $0.07 net gain related to the issuance and early retirement of debt and a $0.04 charge related to the implementation of the U.S. tax legislation. Without these one-time items, EPS was $2.79, up from last year's level of $2.39. That significant rise includes an OpCo operating margin of 19%, a 20 basis point decrease, but reflecting a 20 basis point impact from unfavorable currency, and a 10 basis points drag from the lower margins on our recent acquisition. When you combine these OpCo gains with the earnings of $56.9 million from Financial Services, it brings Snap-On's consolidated operating margin to 23%, down 10 basis points from last year, again, impacted by currency and acquisitions. Let's look at our markets. We believe the auto repair market remains a great place to be despite the variation. The Tools Group, it registered a similar performance to the fourth quarter last year with the U.S. volume down. We clearly haven't returned to growth, but we do see the positives in our new products and in the underlying opportunities. Repair Systems & Information Group, or the RS&I Group, encountering a period of lumpiness in the essential project segment with vehicle OEMs, but despite that, still expanding -- Snap-On -- still expanding Snap-On's presence in the garage, capitalizing on innovative new tools, hardware and software, like the top-of-the-line ZEUS handheld diagnostic and its three-year data package. The blue link mini truck diagnostic unit and are continuously strengthening ProDemand vehicle repair software, all leading to growth and independent repair shops and more than offsetting the OEM lumpiness. C&I, it includes the businesses that serve critical industries and is the most international of our groups. And in the quarter, the results showed progress. Despite some challenges in industrial sectors and troubled geographies, in the critical industries, we saw improvement in the military and heavy-duty and general industry, combining to overcome period-to-period variations, as we call it, in segments like aviation and in places like the Middle East. From SNA Europe, we saw general advances in most of Europe. In our Asia-Pacific division, solid increases in key countries like Japan, China, and India. So, overall, I'd describe our markets as continuing to offer opportunity. Now, challenges still exist and there are pockets of turbulence, but we're encouraged by the advancements in the quarter, progress down our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding our repair shop owners and managers, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broad -- our broadening product line and increasing our understanding of work, giving us the power to grow in critical sectors and important geographies. Now, let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, organic sales were up 1.9%, including the $13.6 million for Norbar and for our most recent acquisition, FASTORQ, and a $13.3 million of favorable foreign currency. First quarter as reported volume rose 11% compared to last year. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $46.5 million, up from the $41.9 million that we recorded last year. The operating margin was 14%, flat with 2017, but with volume and Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCI, offsetting 70 basis points from unfavorable currency and a 10 basis point impact from our recent acquisitions. The story for C&I in the quarter was continuing progress in several of the critical industries and advancements by SNA Europe, partially attenuated by a down period in aviation, both for international and for the U.S. and by lower sales of power tools for the Tools Group. We're confident in and committed to extending in critical industries. We'll keep strengthening our position as we move forward and we have seen continuing gains, held greatly by our lineup of innovative new products, matched to the task, and designed to especially make work easier in the uniquely challenging industrial workplaces. One example is our recently released line of [Indiscernible] pistol grip pneumatic drills manufactured in our Murphy, North Carolina plant. It's a new product line used for drilling ferrous and non-ferrous metals, plastics and composite, aimed at complex assembly and repair where precision is critical. This tool offers a dual chamber motor for high drilling torque, a drop-in motor configuration with simple alignment -- with simple alignment for quick service and at three planned gear carrier for precise -- precision and durability, all great design, all top-of-the-line design features. And it's also quite easy to use and it has a lightweight housing for extended use without strain and a contoured inlay grip for maximum comfort and reduced fatigue. The new Murphy pneumatic drill power, durability and comfort is a winning product for task and critical industries. Now, I already mentioned SNA Europe's organic sales growth. That progress was clearly evident in our results and was broad-based across the European landscaping, including some fairly difficult reasons. Snap-On SNA Europe -- SNA Europe's positive trends or performance now extends to 18 straight quarters with year-over-year sales growth and profitability. It was up once again contributing to C&I performance, now reaching 20 continuous quarters of improvement. The SNA Europe positive trajectory is also driven by innovative new products, products like the all in line BAHCO's precision cutting and holding pliers. Each of these is made with the ball bearing grade-- with ball bearing grade steel for resiliency, toughness, and the ability to withstand high impact. For both the cutting and the holding pliers, the entire frame is heat-treated for superior stiffness and for the cutting -- and the cutting pliers have induction hardened edges, extra strength and sharpness that completes a clean cut for a minimum of 200,000 cycles. BAHCO's new plier line, a powerful hand tool is designed to excel in critical applications. So, based on early inception, the professionals are now using it. The pliers have launched to a very strong reception. Well, that's C&I. Now, onto the Tools Group. Organic sales down 2.7%, a mid-single-digit decline in the U.S., partially offset by a mid-single-digit gain internationally. And operating earnings, $68.9 million, down 2%, that represents a margin rate of 17%, lower by 20 basis points. So, the Tools Group, down in volume, minimizing the impact on profitability. We are seeing turbulence, but our van network remains strong. You can see it in the franchisee metrics. The financial and physical indicators, again this quarter, they remained favorable matching the clear optimism we see when we meet our franchisees. You see, we continue to be confident in the opportunity for our van network and the tools team is working with focus and energy to restart progress with programs like our refurbished rock 'n roll past and with great new products. When we speak of products, we turn to Snap-On Value Creation and the processes of safety, quality, customer connection and innovation and Rapid Continuous improvement. In this case, it's customer connection and innovation, creating new products, solving critical tasks, and we're doing just that. For example, we're building a comprehensive line of ratcheting wrenches, wider than any other available, matching the unique requirements for a broad range workplace. Last quarter, I spoke about the introduction of our longest 12 point, high performance ratcheting box wrenches. They sold extremely well in Q1 in the first quarter and they were joined this quarter by the introduction of our latest and smallest variance of our patented ratcheting wrench family, our compact length Drive Plus reversible ratcheting wrenches available in both SAE and metric and size down to six millimeters. This small, but still professional-grade ratcheting wrenches are equipped with [Indiscernible] gears made in the same special alloy steel found Snap-On's robust socket. Our high-precision forming and machining and our unique call and high gear count provide access to the tightest spaces, while at the same time offering unparalleled confidence in the strength and durability of the tool. These wrenches give the tech working on critical tasks the smallest envelope and the shortest swing arc, exactly what's needed to efficiently work with tiny fasteners in confined spaces. Under the crowded dashes of newer model -- newer model vehicles. Check the 2014 Chevy Silverado some time and you'll see what I mean. This smallest offering in our ratcheting wrench line is one-third the length and one-fifteenth weight of the wrenches we spoke of last quarter. They are compact and they are going to be popular. We believe we have a great range of hand tools in our new ratcheting wrenches and so do the technicians. Hand tools sales were up nicely this quarter, demonstrating our product strength and contributing to the tools market. Another new tools product, the KMP 1422, Snap-On icon tool storage unit, designed after extensive customer connection with younger technicians and launched just as the quarter was closing. Made in our Algona, Iowa plant, the mid-tier unit with broad appeal, but with some great top-end features and unique capacity advantages. It comes standard with integrated -- with an integrated power drawer for recharging cordless power tools and other electronic devices. It has a five outlet, two USB port power strip for charging batteries, cellphones and tablets, all while securely stored in the unit. And it offers a special speed drawer with configurable dividers giving the technician quick access to small tools and parts, a very attractive feature. But most importantly, the icon has a redesigned profile, taller than our usual mid-tier boxes, providing greater capacity within the standard footprint, great for the compacts spaces, sometimes allocated to new techs. And along with the capacity and size, the new design offers strong durability, heavy-duty drawer slide, reinforcing our panels and vibration-absorbing chassis on a wider wheelbase, also provide a more stable environment for those heavy tool loads. We release the icon at the end of the quarter and we've seen some promising interest since its launch. Let me make one more point on the Tools Group quarter. We've been increasing our emphasis on software with the shops and tech for some time, selling updates, promoting subscriptions, and with the ZEUS, focusing on a three-year data package. While in the first quarter, our software sales were up significantly, not enough to restart growth, but it does help overall profitability, and it does represent a very promising development. Now, let's speak of RS&I, first quarter organic sales rose 2.6%, mid-single-digit gains registered by our diagnostic and repair information businesses focused on independent shops, low single-digit growth by our businesses focused on OEM dealers, and flat volume in our undercar equipment operation. Operating earnings of $85.8 million increased $6.7 million from 2017. Operating margin was 25.5%, up 70 basis points, overcoming a 60 basis point impact from currency and acquisition. Now, in the -- now, the OEM facing business advanced, but not as strongly in the recent past. You might remember that that operation is rooted in the essential diagnostic and tool commissioned by auto manufacturers for the dealers. Every quarter, some programs end and others begin. It's always been a lumpy arena and in the first quarter, our new projects, once again, outweighed those which are ending, but not by us a bigger margins in the past. So, the business showed lower growth. It's not indicative of a trend or the future. It's just the lumpy nature of that business. Having said that, we continue to clearly see abundant runways for growth in the RS&I group, expanding Snap-On's presence in the garage. You can see it in the opportunities. You can see the opportunities and continuing progress demonstrated by our sales of diagnostics and information to independent repair shops. That activity was, once again up, this time, mid-single-digits, showing our strong position, rooted in comprehensive repair information, wide coverage of makes, models, and years and amplified by our proprietary and formidable database of actual repair records, providing unique and time-saving shortcuts for technicians. We keep expanding in those independent shops, driven by products like Mitchell 1's ProDemand for light vehicles, cars, light trucks and SUVs. Late last year, we enhanced ProDemand software with the addition of one search, providing clearly enhanced navigation and search capabilities. It was a winning move, driving more sales. This quarter, we upped the ante again, making it possible to identify vehicles configuration simply by entering the license plate number. With that new feature, technician can enter the plate number and ProDemand will automatically identify the VIN and provide a specific equipment and service data for that particular vehicle. What a timesaver and for job service writers and for vehicle technicians for both of those populations. It really helps. But Snap-On and RS&I isn't only in light vehicles. We're in repair information for commercial trucks. Mitchell 1's truck repair suite for medium and heavy-duty trucks helps professional diagnose and repair all makes of class for to class A trucks, saving mechanics' time throughout the fixed. It's the only comprehensive truck information software of its kind available and we keep building its strength, expanding the capabilities and adding features like our comprehensive repair job estimating package, a very popular feature. And recently, we expanded again, adding a truck shop management system that helps businesses streamline and repair process, helps the business itself streamline and repair process, improve shop communication, engage with customers and track performance. Snap-On had decades of expertise in offering high-quality shop management solutions for light vehicle -- for the light vehicle repair market. And now that time-tested software has been adapted for trucks helping that special segment improve efficiency. And the product has been received with enthusiasm. You can see it in the continuing Mitchell1 growth numbers and there's much more opportunity for further expansion. Now, just finally, if you step back, you see that RS&I in recent quarters has shown some very encouraging growth in its vehicle software products. Those products are getting stronger every quarter. And this past period was no exception. Software was up significantly. It's evident in the RS&I OI margin of 25.5%, up 50 basis points, again, 60 basis points of currency and acquisition impact. So, those are the highlights of the quarter. Continued progress, overcoming headwinds against variation, sales growth and profitability gain, Tools Group challenged, period-to-period variation in some areas, but strength enhancement in software helping to achieve a 19% optical operating margin down to 20 basis points, but overcoming 30 basis points of impact of currency and acquisitions. EPS of $2.82 -- $2.79, excluding the $0.07 net gain related to net debt items and the $0.04 charge related to the U.S. tax legislation, up from $2.39 last year. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $935.5 million in the quarter increased 5.5%, reflecting a 0.8% organic sales gain, $14.3 million of acquisition-related sales, and $26.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross margin of 50.4% declined 10 basis points, primarily due to 20 basis points of unfavorable currency, 10 basis points from acquisitions, as well as other higher costs, but these were partially offset by savings from RCI. The operating expense margin of 31.4% compared to 31.3% last year. Operating earnings before Financial Services as a percentage of sales was 19%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency compared to 19.2% last year. Financial Services revenue of $83 million and operating earnings of $56.9 million increased $6.2 million and $4.4 million respectively from 2017. Consolidated operating earnings of 23% of revenues compared to 23.1% of revenues a year ago. Other income expense net was income of $2.8 million. This includes a net gain of $5.5 million that was associated with the treasury lock settlement gain of $13.3 million. This is related to the February issuance of $400 million of 4.1% 30-year senior notes. This was partially offset by a $7.8 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the repayment of $200 million of 6.7% 10-year senior notes that were originally due in 2019. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 26.2% was increased by 120 basis points as a result of an additional $2.6 million tax charge. This reflects IRS guidance issued during the first three months of this year related to the implementation of last year's U.S. tax legislation and the computation of the company's 2017 federal income tax liability. Excluding this charge, the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 as adjusted was 25.0% and compared to 30.7% in the first quarter of 2017. Finally, net earnings of $163 million or $2.82 per share diluted share compared to $141.6 million or $2.39 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding both the aforementioned net debt items and the tax charge, net earnings as adjusted was $161.5 million or $2.79 per diluted share, up 16.7% compared to prior year Tier 1 earnings per share. Now, let's talk to our results. Starting with the C&I group on slide seven. Sales of $331.6 million in the quarter increased 11%, reflecting a 1.9% organic sales gain, $13.6 million of acquisition-related sales, and $13.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes low single-digit sales gains in customers in the critical industries and the European-based hand tool business and in the segment Asia-Pacific operations. These gains were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in sales of power tools. Gross margin of 39% decreased 10 basis points, primarily due to 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from higher sales volume and RCI. The operating expense margin of 25% improved 10 basis points as 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects were more than offset by benefits from RCI and other cost-reduction initiatives. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $46.5 million increased 11% and the operating margin of 14% was unchanged from 2017 despite 70 basis points of unfavorable currency effects. Turning now to slide eight. Sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $404.7 million decreased 1.1%, reflecting a 2.7% organic sales decline, partially offset by $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease includes a mid-single-digit decline in the United States, driven by lower sales of big ticket items, which was only partially offset by a mid-single-digit sales gain internationally. Gross margin of 44.6% increased 130 basis points year-over-year, principally due to 50 basis points of favorable foreign currency, but also a year-over-year shift in product mix and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 27.6% increased 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the effect of the lower sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $68.9 million decreased 2% and the operating margin of 17% compared to 17.2% in 2017. Turning to the RS&I shown on slide nine, sales of $337 million increased to 5.7%, reflecting a 2.6% organic sales gain, $0.7 million of acquisition-related sales, and $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products and a low single-digit sales increase to OEM dealerships. Sales of undercar equipment was essentially flat. Gross margin of 48.1% decreased 40 basis points, mostly due to 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 22.6% improved 110 basis points, largely due to benefits from sales volume leverage and RCI initiatives, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $85.5 million increased 8.5% from prior year levels. The operating margin of 25.5% improved 70 basis points from last year. Now, turning to slide 10, operating earnings from Financial Services of $556.9 million on revenue of $83 million increased 8.4% and 8.1%, respectively, from a year ago. Financial Services expenses of $26.1 million increased $1.8 million due to a $2.8 million year-over-year increase in provisions for losses on finance receivables, which totaled $15.8 million in the quarter. On a sequential basis, finance receivable provision expense was down slightly from $16 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.3% in both the first quarters of 2018 and 2017. In the first quarter, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.8% in 2018 compared to 18% in 2017, driven principally by product mix. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% and 9.3%. Total loan originations of $247.3 million decreased $17.3 million or 6.5% year-over-year due to a 9.4% decline in finance receivable originations, resulting from lower year-over-year sales of big ticket items in the United States for the Snap-On Tools Group, partially offset by higher originations of contract receivables. Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.74 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross Financial Services portfolio grew $8.3 million in the first quarter. As for finance portfolio, losses and delinquency trends, they are tracking higher year-over-year similar to what we've seen over the last several quarters. That said we believe the overall portfolio metrics continue to support an appropriate risk/reward balance in this segment of our business. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12-month net losses of $49.4 million represented 3.08% of outstandings at quarter end, up 61 basis points year-over-year and 16 basis points sequentially. The 60-plus day delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit improved 30 basis points sequentially, a bit better than the typical seasonal improvement of 10 to 20 basis points from the fourth to first quarter. Overall, operating earnings in the Financial Services segment rose 8.4% year-over-year and our allowance for accounts reflects the above-mentioned trends and portfolio performance. Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $231.9 million in the quarter increased to $39.5 million from comparable 2017 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings and an increase from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by cash proceeds from the 2017 treasury lock settlement. Net cash used by investing activities of $37.1 million, included net additions to finance receivables of $16.5 million, down from $53.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net cash used by investing activities also included capital expenditures of $18 million and $3 million from the acquisition of FASTORQ, which provides hydraulic torque and tensioning products for use in the critical industries. Net cash used by financing activities of $190.5 million included $450 million in senior note repayments. Dividend payments to shareholders of $46.5 million and the repurchase of 275,000 shares of common stock for $43.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of March 31st, we have remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $372.8 million of common stock under existing authorizations. These amounts were partially offset for the February sale of the $400 million of 30-year senior notes. Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $5.2 million from 2017 year end levels, due principally to $8.1 million of favorable foreign currency. Days sales outstanding of 66 days was consistent with 2017 year end. Inventories increased $40 million from 2017 year end, $20.9 million of which related to the recognition of an inventory asset associated with the adoption of ASU Topic 606 on revenue recognition. In addition, foreign currency translation contributed $9.5 million of the increase. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 3.1 compared to 3.2 at year end 2017. Our quarter end cash position of $97.5 million increased $5.5 million from 2017 year end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio increased to 24.4% from 27% at year-end 2017. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, we had $132 million of commercial pay per borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks Aldo. Well, let me sum up. Snap-On's first quarter, progress against headwinds, some areas not where we would like, but also some significant gains. Our traditional strength, hand tools growing contributing significantly with new products leading the way and software, with techs and vehicle repair shops continuing upward trend in the quarter. That combination help to overcome the headwinds and drives general progress. The Tools Group, down, but we're confident that we have the market, the products, and the team to move forward and upwards. C&I, critical industries, gains, overcoming period-to-period variations and SNA Europe continuing its long upward trend. RS&I, ongoing gains with independent repair shop owners and managers, overcoming the lumpiness of OEM -- of the OEM central programs with a 25.5% operating margin. It all added up to a quarter of continued growth and profitability, and we believe it points to abundant opportunities and confirms that Snap-On has the position and the capabilities, the product, and that market to continue its positive trend through the rest of 2018 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly for a moment to our franchisees and associates. Our first quarter results, our positive trend of performance, and our significant opportunities going forward would not be possible without your extraordinary contributions. For your success in driving our progress, you have my congratulations. And for your continuing dedication to our team, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And you will hear first from David Leiker of Baird. Joe Vruwink : Hi, this is Joe Vruwink for David. Nicholas Pinchuk : Hello Joe. Joe Vruwink : I wanted to start with tools, so with finance receivable originations that 9% tools organic down less than 3%. Obviously, the implications at hand tools saw a really nice acceleration, particularly relative to what Q4 saw. I'm wondering what were the biggest differences between your execution in this Q1 quarter versus Q4. Nicholas Pinchuk : Look, I think a couple of things. I think a couple of new products rolled out, our ratcheting wrench line expanded, there was a couple that I mentioned and some of the packaging that we had off -- the kick-off started to make sense to people and so you started -- people getting attracted to adding to their positions on hand tools. I think that's it. Generally, the compelling nature of the new hand tools was I think what drove this. Joe Vruwink : And in the past, you have alluded to monitoring the POS off the van that giving you a sense of confidence that retail activity was pretty good, but your own sales into the channel were perhaps lagging retail activity. Where does that dynamic stand today? And I ask if new products are more compelling, does that potentially drive a restocking effect at some point this year? Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. I think that's true. I think, look -- I think what we saw is that big ticket items read -- principally, the big ticket items are tool storage didn't sell as well. We still have some work to do in that regard. You faired that out, you see it in the originations, but there's sort of like smaller ticket items sold pretty well off the van and so that seems a reasonable trend in the current situation. What we have to do is solve the tool storage problematic and I think that has to do with data compelling nature of the product. I talked about the icon; we think that's one step towards that. The idea of the rock 'n' roll camp is another step in that regard. Tools Group just keeps trying to look at the situation and the solution is, as I said, programs and products. You've got the icon, you've got the new ratchets, you have the new ZEUS out there with moving and positioning as more towards software, which seems to work reasonably well. And we've got other new products being introduced as we speak right now. Joe Vruwink : Okay. And if I can switch to RS&I. So, we're coming out of this pretty unique environment, where sales growth had been pretty consistent for five quarters. Obviously, this segment is a lot lumpier historically. Is the OEM facilitation business, would you say that's exclusively responsible for the deceleration in growth in Q1? And given your visibility on new model programs that are going to be launching in 2018, do you have any sense, Q2 is going to be better or expect some feature of the quarter to also exclude exhibit some deceleration? Nicholas Pinchuk : Look, a couple of things. First of all, it's not exclusively the reason. We had some -- so if you looked that we have some a little bit more tepid sales of undercar equipment and that had something to do with the sell-through in the Tools Group. Some of that -- some of the lower end stuff sell-through in the Tools Group, you have some of that. But principally, I think that big driver was in that OEM business. Now, when we look forward, we have no reason to believe that the projects are tailing off. It's a matter of the calendarization of them and when they go in and out and which ones we capture. So, you kind of have a complex cocktail. I, on the other hand, hold to my longtime view of the world that we say we grow to 4% to 6% organically and RS&I is in the middle of that. And if you remember, for I think it's 2015 and 2016, RS&I grew at 4.6% and 4.7% each year. Last year, they happen to grow at 7.4%, but we kept saying, it's in the middle of that 4% to 6% range over the long-term. We still feel that way. Joe Vruwink : And then last question. There's a lot of focus right now on competitive dynamics and diagnostics and how ZEUS is faring and how Snap-On more broadly is faring. You talked about really strong growth in software, both for the Tools Group and RS&I. Can you bracket that? Is that mid-single, high single, double-digit? Just an update on your diagnostic growth and what you're seeing there? Nicholas Pinchuk : If you're talking about me bracketing or dimensioning the software growth, I talked about -- I think saying it's up significantly is reasonable. I don't want to get reporting on another segment myself, but I think that's very positive. I think, look -- I think -- I can tell you this; ZEUS sold better than its predecessor significantly. So, I think we're very positive about that and one of the things right now we're introducing what we call the Apollo, which adds smart data to smart scans, smart data to the midrange line. So, that's rolling out as we speak. See the Tools Group is not taking this -- looking at this situation very without urgency and focus. So, one of the things that we're doing is we're doubling down on that idea and rolling out in the mid-tier. I feel pretty positive about this. And early return say it's going to be a strong product. Joe Vruwink : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everyone. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning. David MacGregor : Nick, just talk a little more about the tools segments and just, I guess, you talked about normalized growth in 4% to 6%, I think the tool segment is typically thought of kind of a 4% in that range -- at the lower end of that range. And notwithstanding, it sounds like you've got some new wrenches, you've got some new products out there that you're -- it sounds like you're pinning your expectations for a recovery in growth performance around new products, but-- Nicholas Pinchuk : I wouldn't necessarily use the word pinning. That sounds like that's the only thing we're doing. David MacGregor : I guess I wanted to get at that because-- Nicholas Pinchuk : I didn\u2019t say that. No, I don't mean. Look, we're doing a lot of other things. Rock 'n' roll camp, a new catalog, a number of different programs, better training for our franchisees. So, we're doing other things. David MacGregor : Right. So, maybe -- you did get on a few of these things, for instance, the franchisee transition to larger vans. How did that contribute to your first quarter segment growth, let's start with that? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, I think that's hard to the measure because it's complex cocktail of things. You've got the rollout of the 20-foot vans and then there's a kind of I think burn-in what we're finding about these vans, they come out, they get to 20-foot vans, it gives them more inventory. But the guys figure out -- in other words, more retail space. But the guys had to figure out how to wield it in their particular route. So, it takes a little while for that to become pretty effective. So, when you overlay that, it's hard to really quantify that. But we feel, we feel -- I think I've said this many times on these calls that our performance is proportional to -- in some ways, proportional to the freeing more time of the franchisee and to -- which is some of the programs were doing, and adding more retail space. So, that's one of the things for the long-term. It's one of things where we feel okay and confident about the position that we're in. David MacGregor : All right. Storage, how bad was it, can you say? Nicholas Pinchuk : It was double-digits, upper double-digits. So, it wasn't -- it was a quarter, which is sort of like what we've seen, down. So, we haven't solved the tool storage problem. Now, these things -- when you start to look -- David, when you start to look quarter-to-quarter, you look at every quarter and you start to look at the numbers, you can get balled up in these things. Some of it types of focus. You launch ZEUS, people focus on that. They may not sell other things, but it's clear that tool storage is not where we would like it and it wasn't where we would like it this quarter again. David MacGregor : As the rock 'n' roll camp refresh influenced organic growth here at all? Nicholas Pinchuk : It's still too early to tell. It's been rolled out in the fourth quarter and we still -- we're still working on the configurator, which was a big part of the refurbishment, the 3D configurator with a little bit more activity. So, it's hard to say that right now, but we believe, based on the receptions I heard, I talked to more than a dozen franchisees, they're pretty positive about it. So, we'll see. These are one of these things -- it's kind of an art. We think we've got to the right mix, but we'll see. David MacGregor : And you noted diagnostics were positive contributor to the RS&I growth, but what did they contribute to tools segment growth number? Is it positively or negatively? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, the Tools Group, the Tools Group, ZEUS was strong in terms of sales. But overall, the diagnostics business was down because of focus on the Tools Group. So, the other products, the mid-tier and the sort of like MODIS, which is between mid-tier and high tier were down and so that offset had a kind of downward push on the diagnostics number. If you look at it off the van, they were kind of off the van, the diagnostics sales were sort of flattish year-over-year and that is against the thermal imager of last year. So, I think the franchisees are looking at it as pretty good sales. Now, of course, the ZEUS is focused on a certain population, the Senior, Senior Tech and the shop owner. So, it's a select group of people you're selling too. David MacGregor : Okay. Last question for me and that is just you've talked about regaining back to a 4% growth rate, I guess, is a long-term normalized number for tools. Kind of six consecutive quarters now below that. What's the time expectation before we can get back to a 4%? Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't have time concept on that. All I can tell you is, boy, I'm impressed with the product we're rolling out. You would be too if you set where I am. that's all I can say. David MacGregor : Thanks. Thanks a lot. Operator : And our next question comes from Liam Burke of B. Riley FBR. Liam Burke : Yes, thank you. Good morning Nick, good morning Aldo. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning Liam. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Liam Burke : Nick, you had a strong finish in 2017 in C&I across the Board, both on critical industries and geography. This quarter, Europe looks strong. How did Asia-Pacific do? And could you give us some sense on longer term, how some of the other underperforming critical industries will go? Nicholas Pinchuk : Look, I think it's -- I sort of think it's like this. Asia-Pacific -- Southeast Asia is kind of weak, but we're -- we were encouraged, so we had some down drafts in places like Indonesia and Thailand, which created some offset. But India, Japan, China, up nicely. So, Asia-Pacific I think, if you look at the total, you're kind of encouraged by that. If you look at critical industries and you look at the down -- aviation was off, but we view it as period-to-period. If you step back and you look -- and you look at the six months associated with our critical industries across all the segments, you're approaching double-digits. So, it's a matter of variation when the projects fall from quarter-to-quarter in various segments. So, that business is a little bit lumpy. Remember that C&I grew -- what are the growth? 10.1% organically in the quarter last quarter. So, we see a little bit of lumpiness flowing through there. We don't see anything -- I don't read anything into the little bit lower growth in the C&I this quarter. Liam Burke : Okay, great. And you did highlight power tools sales into -- from -- into the Snap-On Tool Group channel. Do you think the new product introductions will help stem that decline or was it factor -- was it at a competitive factor or? Nicholas Pinchuk : No. Look I think there's always competitive factors in power tools. It's a very competitive sector. I think simply, that is -- Tools Group, they launched a couple of great products last year. Tools Group stacked up with those products. There's a little bit less -- the demand was kind of -- they're adjusting for the demand. So, basically, they didn't have new product this quarter. Therefore, they ordered less out of the tools -- out of the C&I group. It wasn't really indicative or directly associated with the sales of them to the van or the van to the end-user. So, basically, it was adjustment of new products. As they roll out new products, that's going to change. Liam Burke : Okay. And Aldo, cash flow was very strong for the quarter. Does this change any of your allocation view? I mean, obviously, acquisitions, as I come along make sense, but how do you look at balancing the rest of the cash allocation? Aldo Pagliari : Liam, it was a good quarter for cash flow and I think our fundamental mission of supporting organic growth and looking selectively at M&A remains at the top of that choice. But looking at dividends and share repurchase opportunistically remains on the radar screen and the more cash, obviously, the more opportunities to do things like that. Liam Burke : Great. Thanks Nick, thanks Aldo. Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks Liam. Operator : And we'll hear next from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hey good morning everyone. Nicholas Pinchuk : Gary. Gary Prestopino : Hey, Nick, a couple of quarters here you've talked about just the software part of your business getting a lot of traction. I guess what I'd like to know is -- has something changed on a secular basis in terms of the needs for the software. Or is this just something that Snap-On is starting to emphasize more and rolling out new products in conjunction with the software, the ability that you have on the software side? Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't think there's any -- I don't think with regard to the market, there's a singularity. There is a nice tailwind, as I said many times, having technicians -- more and more technicians to require more and more diagnostics to be able to do repair effectively. You've heard me say 40% of them have diagnostics now. They're moving where they're all going to need them. And the cars are getting even more complicated so that those diagnostics have to be even more sophisticated. And I guess if there's anything -- any change here, it's the fact that we discovered the power of big data and we are deploying it. So, we've had SureTrack, the idea of the $1 billion records of real repair fixes and now we have the $100 billion snapshots of associated with the smart data. And so those things in the ZEUS, first in the ZEUS and now and what we're rolling out today, the Apollo, really worked pretty well, I think, and have made our diagnostics even more ascendant, and that's worked pretty well. And the other thing is as you look at our focus on the three-year data pack associated with ZEUS, that's an intent to try to have our franchisees spend more time selling software. That's what they're doing. Gary Prestopino : So, when you sell ZEUS or one of your truck guys sells ZEUS, is that software sale recorded in tools or is that recorded in RS&I? Nicholas Pinchuk : Look, it's recorded in tools, but remember that the three-year package is sold by the franchisees and then we record it on an amortized basis over the 36 months. So, we don't get it as an immediate pop. It's kind of different for us. So, we [Indiscernible] the revenue back. Right. Gary Prestopino : Right. Okay. Could you -- I know somebody mentioned -- asked the question about bracketing, but could you maybe just give us an idea of just as a percentage of all your sales, where this -- where your total software sales are now? Nicholas Pinchuk : You can think of it this way. Software sales are about one-third of the RS&I business. I think that's a good dimension for it. And most of the software flows through RS&I and some of it to other divisions, other segments. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : And we'll hear next from Scott Stember of C.L. King. Scott Stember : Good morning guys. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning. Scott Stember : Nick, just talking about the Tool Group. I know you don't want to pin a time when you would see things turning around or turning back to positive, but taking a look, I mean obviously the comparisons beginning in the second quarter start to get a lot easier. And with some of the new products out and with the Tools doing better, maybe just talk how you feel about that as you head into the back half of the year when you're going up against easier comparisons? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, I never like to talk about comparisons. I always like to look at the quarter itself, that's more or less -- we look at the absolute value and profitability created by the thing, not necessarily compared on a year-over-year basis, that's more for this kind of -- we certainly like to improve. We hold ourselves to a standard to improve, but really, we focus on the creating of value, more value each time. I don't know, look, obviously, arithmetically, weaker comparisons make it likely that you're going to see growth. I mean that's certainly true. I feel confident that the Tools Group, like I said, has the products and the team and the market to go forward. I don't know about the time constant. That's all. There are a lot of variables in this kind of thing. And so I think, as myself, I think I feel increasingly better about the situation, but I don't know when all these advancements are going to take -- get traction. Scott Stember : Got it. But from a longer term picture, just to reemphasize that you still believe that this is a 4% to 6% grower this segment over the long haul. Nicholas Pinchuk : Absolutely. Scott Stember : Got it. And then just turning back over to the intercompany impact from tools on C&I. Can you maybe frame out how much that took out of the C&I's growth, organic growth maybe just try to give us the true organic number is for the -- just for the true C&I end markets. Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, you can kind of see that in the intercompany sales I think in C&I. But look, I think I don't want to get down into that kind of detail out in this call. Look, all I can say is the reduction of sales to power tools group had an impact on the overall C&I Group that might've been a couple of basis points or something like that, a couple of hundred basis points, right? Sorry. Scott Stember : Got it. And just last question on tariffs, obviously, you guys used a lot of steel in the like maybe just talk about where your steel comes from and maybe... Nicholas Pinchuk : Comes from the U.S. Scott Stember : From the U.S., okay. And maybe just talk about what -- in the event that there are broad steel increases across the Board, what the game plan would be? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, look I think we source our steel from the U.S. We don't -- we source maybe what, $80 million worth of steel, it's mostly from the U.S. It's all from the U.S. Generally, U.S. prices have risen in the last, what, couple of years, 30% I think end-to-end in anticipation of some kind of action around this. So, I don't know what the tariffs will have -- what effect that tariffs will have in the long-term, may be no effect on U.S. steel, may be some slight effect. But we generally think we can price for visible inflation and I think we've demonstrated that over time. The other facts of any kind of over tariffs and so on, generally, we're making the markets, in which we sell in terms of finished goods, sometimes we're importing components, but if those components get tariffs on them, we'll just source someplace else. Scott Stember : Got it. That's all I have. Thanks for taking my questions. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : And our last question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning. Bret Jordan : Hey, could you talk about the market in general sort of from a competitive landscape? I guess looking at your sales growth versus underlying market may be market share trends, are you seeing either increased competition at the service level for Mack [ph] or Matco? Or the import diagnostic guys like Launch or Autel pushing harder? Or is it just the market itself relatively sluggish? Nicholas Pinchuk : I have pondered this question for some time. We grew substantially, I guess, 2010 to 2011, same-store sales. The market itself grew pretty well. So, we don't necessarily focus on in market share or anything like that. And -- but recently, you look at some of the other people announcing good results, well, we have had not where we would like. But when I asked the franchisees, Bret, they say I'm not feeling pressure. So, what's ever happening in our space is not being induced by other people. Their view is, if I'm not selling, it's not because I'm being aced out by somebody else's product. Now, I suppose there's exceptions to that, of course. Somebody could have a better power tool or a better compressor or something like that or for a particular application, maybe. But in general, we don't hear that and I just talked to -- like I said, within the last week, I've talked to more than a dozen guys and I ask them that question and they all said things like that. Now, the competition are smart guys and I'm sure they are prospering, but our franchisees are not talking about or asking about it. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then a housekeeping, what's the price point on Apollo? And Aldo, if you can break at the inventor again, what was 606, what was acquisitions, and what was core inventory year-over-year? Aldo Pagliari : Well, sure. With respect to the inventory, you had a $20.9 million adjustment just related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard 606. And if you look at the effects of currency in the quarter that was $9.5 million and a nominal effect that was less than $1 million related to acquisitions. So, that would leave you with an operating variance or growth in inventory of about $9.5 million. Bret Jordan : Okay. And what's the price point on Apollo? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, I tell you what, I really meant it when I said we're rolling it out as we speak. So, I don't necessarily -- I'm afraid of giving stealing the thunder of my guys, but I will tell you this is its predecessor was list priced about $4,500. Of course, the street price has some lower number from that and this will be a premium over that. Bret Jordan : So, this sells against MODIS or--? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, SOLUS. Bret Jordan : SOLUS, okay. Thank you. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Bret Jordan : Great. Thanks guys. Nicholas Pinchuk : Thank you. Operator : And with no other questions, I will now turn the conference back to Leslie Kratcoski for any additional or closing remarks. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks, again, everyone for joining us today. A replay will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we thank you for your interest in the company. Good day. Operator : Again, that does include a call. We would like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Leslie. Good morning everybody. As usual, I'll start with some of the highlights of our quarter. I will speak about the general environment, the trends we see, some of the headwinds we have encountered and the progress we\u2019ve made. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. We believe that our second quarter further demonstrated Snap-On's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results over coming headwinds and period and period variations. We\u2019re encouraged by these results. Like every quarter, we had disparity from group to group and within each group. The van business remains below trend, and some segments and some geographies still a down period, but once again our strength overcame diagnostic progress in the van network, broad gains in the critical industries and rise in our software products across our business. Those gains overcame the variations and moved us forward again. Our reported sales of the quarter were up 33.2 million or 3.6% to 954.6 million including positive foreign currency translation of 13 million. They also reflected an incremental 8.1 million from acquisitions, including last year\u2019s Norbar operations and this year's FASTORQ business. Now, organic sales for the rose 1.3% with strong activity in critical industries and in diagnostic and repair information product, some of our higher margin areas. The OpCo margin was 20.2% reaching 20% for the first time, representing a 30 basis points increase over 2017 including an unfavorable 10 basis points drag from lower margin acquisitions and 20 basis points of favorable currency, profitability that demonstrates the ability of Snap-On value creation that consistently drive earnings growth. For financial services, operating income grew to 57.8 million from last year's of 54.6 million that result combined with OpCo to raise our consolidated operating margin to 24.2%, up similar 30 basis points. Earnings per share, they reached $3.12 including a $0.01 benefit related to the implementation of the U.S. tax legislation. That EPS was up from the $2.60 recorded last year, a rise of 20%. So those are the numbers. From an overall macro perspective, we do believe the automotive repair arena remains favorable. The Tools Group didn\u2019t return to growth, but we did see sequential improvement and we do see further opportunities for advancement. The other side of order repair activity, repair system information of the RS&I Group encountered a period of unevenness across the business. Higher sales of diagnostic and repair information to independent repair supplements and manager verses a decline in the equipment area, despite that we like RS&I's progress and capitalizing on the rising requirement for database solutions and vehicle repair. Snap-On has a growing array of leading products to take advantage of that trend, new repair tools, hardware and software like the innovative midrange Apollo handheld diagnostics, incorporating intelligence diagnostics in its two year data package. And in products like our continuing improving Mitchell 1 ProDemand repair information software, strong offerings like those in software and data arena and data areas served RS&I and Snap-On very well in the quarter. For the commercial and industrial or the C&I Group, organic sales were up mid single digits, solid organic growth across sectors and geographies, and the critical industries double digit improvement around the world strengthened places like aviation, natural resources, military and general industry, progress in almost every sector also encouraging for C&I. SNA Europe, our European hand tools business delivering another quarter of sales growth, and our Asia Pacific division registering solid increase in key countries like India, Indonesia and Japan. So, overall, the results remain favorable. The Tool Group, sequential improvement, but not back to growth. RS&I uneven results but propelled by advancement in diagnostics and information products, offset by challenges in undercar equipment and strong gains in the critical industries of C&I. The opportunities out way the challenges and the results show it. In the operating income margin clearly demonstrated once again the leverage and the power of Snap-On value creation, safety, quality custom connection, innovation and rapid continues improvement. Those are the principles guiding our organization in the ongoing development of our product and solutions, borne out of the insights and observations gathered at our customers' workplace which together with RCI helps drive the product and margin progress again. Well, that's the macro overview. Now, let's move to the segment. In the C&I Group, organic sales were up 4.4% including 8.1 million from Norbar and FASTORQ and 5.8 million of favorable foreign currency as reported volumes rose by 9%. The operating income of C&I improves to 14.5%, a 60 basis point rise from 2017. Volume in RCI will offset 30 basis points from unfavorable currency and a 10 basis points impact from those recent acquisitions. For the industrial division, the progress across the critical industries was broad based at double digits with most sectors and most geographies advancing in the quarter. We believe the reasonably positive macroeconomic conditions coupled with an array of new products that saw a critical path to driving those gains and they are continuing. Speaking of critical industries and product, one of the great demonstrations of customer attraction and innovation has been our automated tool control system ATC the smart took box that keeps track of repair tool, avoiding foreign object damage that's important in so many places, made in our Algona, Iowa and Conway Arkansas plant. It's been a forefront of our extension of critical industries and it keeps evolving. Just recently adding a fingerprint feature to the basic card ID access protocol and we have also launched a new facial recognition access system that expands ATC's adaptability and application helping support ongoing international placement. ATC, a spearhead, a Snap-On -- a spearhead for Snap-On in critical industry, it's already recognized at the top of the line and tool control and we're making it stronger. Precision is becoming increasingly important in critical situations, and torque products are significant enabler in that trend. We've been building our torque capabilities to match that direction. In this quarter, our City of Industry, California torque operation, combined with our Sturtevant Richmont acquisition in Illinois to extend the Sturtevant Richmont digital torque control series, the DTC. The first facility of Sturtevant Richmont interchangeable heads in the compact package of a City of Industry, micro torque electronics they've been combined at another dimension to our DTC line. It gives us more to sell in critical heavy assembly operations where the space is often tightened and ability to adapt wrench head size is quite valuable as the technician moves from application-to-application. We believe we have a winner in the new digital torque control series and early customer feedback confirms it. In the late last quarter, we introduced a new half inch pneumatic impact wrench, the PT650 power tool, manufactured at our Murphy North Carolina facility right here in the U.S. You might remember that top of the line PT850 introduced to accolades last year, 810 foot pounds in power while still waiting a relatively light 4.3 pound, the go-to-tool for the top professionals, top tech love it. Well, late in June, we introduced its little sibling, the PT650 power tool, also from the Murphy plant, little less power, little 50 and of course more economical. It's an attractive package aimed at the entry level technician and we hear good things about its reception. To C&I a promising quarter, moving down its runways for growth, extending to critical industries and driving strong profitability. Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales down 1.5%, reflecting primarily a low single digit decline in the U.S. and essentially flat international results. Operating earnings 79 million, down 2.1% and OI down to 0.1% and OI margin of 19.2% lower by 30 basis points, but still among the groups strongest. We do believe our actions to reinvigorate the van channel, our bearing fruit. This quarter they didn't increase -- create an overall increase, but they did positively affect the U.S franchise operations. Tool storage showed some recovery. Lead by the new high margin mid range KCP1422 and by handheld diagnostics also made progress, authoring another increase in software sales. As we rollout more Apollo and ZEUS unit with the revolutionary intelligence diagnostic feature, the data package sales that accompanies most of those units builds our software penetration, and software sales did grow again this quarter. You can see it in the Tools Group's gross margin. It rose to 45.9% up a 150 basis point. Now do impart the favorable currency, but that also reflected a big boost from the power of our new products, beyond the financial numbers. We do see continuing strength in other areas, advancements in our network are also evident franchisee health metrics, indicators we monitor and evaluate regularly, and again this quarter they remain favorable and that positivity was not just from our own measures we again acknowledge by outside publication, listing Snap-On as a franchise of choice both interest the U.S and abroad. We finished number 11, up two spots in entrepreneur magazine list of top global franchises published in June. Entrepreneur ranks, the top 200 global franchisees by using 150 data points formula factors like cost and fees, franchise support, branch strength, financial strength, stability and international size and growth. Now, this type of recognition reflects the fundamental and contemporary strength of our franchises in our overall van business. We wouldn't have been achieved without innovative new products. I just spoke about the introduction of our Snap-On KCP1425. We spoke about it last quarter as well, a full featured mid-tier tool storage unit with greater capacity in a compact footprint, made in Algona, Iowa released at the end of March. It was a clear success and it did help our tool storage line move forward. And we believe that our new socket line, the Flank Drive Extra, we call it FDX, will have a significant long-term positive impact out of our Milwaukee plant, the FDX is the simply the most important innovation in socket design since the original Snap-On Flank Drive System was introduced decades ago. The new FDX delivers improved turning power, better stationer engagement in greater strength. The patent innovation is that a grips the fasteners further off the corner with a more angled socket wall for greater turning power as much as 50% more on damaged round and fasteners, very important in a garage. It has an optimally chamfered lift on the hex end, additional leverage on shallow headed fasteners and fasteners with limited top clearance. The contour of outer wall enables easier socket removal and the large clearly identifiable markings on the socket size, make picking the correct size fast and easy even in dimly lit spaces. It was launched in June, the initial response has been quite enthusiastic and we believe it should be. Well, that's a Tools Group. Now onto RS&I, as reported sales of 343.1 million, up 1.5% including positive currency translation of 4.9 million -- including positive currency translation of 4.9 million. Organic sales were flat reflecting mid single digit sales gains of diagnostics and repair information products to the independent repair shop owners and managers, flat OEM dealership activity and mid single-digit decline in undercar equipment. Now RS&I operating earnings in the quarter increased 6.5 million or 7.9% to 88.7 million. The operating margin was strong 25.9%, up 160 basis points overcoming 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation, a margin gain that was again driven by innovative product. Repair shop products like our NEXIQ pocket HD handheld diagnostic for the heavy duty truck market specifically designed using customer connection for OEM and aftermarket repair centers or for fleet maintenance facilities. The pocket HD provides immediate access to critical diagnostic information for heavy duty repair. It's both versatile and reliable with the larger display and user friendly features, whether you're responsible for maintaining a large fleet or just responsible for a truck or two. The intuitive software of the pocket HD makes diagnostic easy. It comes preloaded with the standard heavy duty and light medium truck data and it also offers software for particular filter like regeneration and anti-lock system software, which covers both Bendix and Meritor WABCO systems. The new pocket HD is a powerful addition to any truck shop and we believe it's a winning product. Late last year, we launched the ZEUS, our top of the line handheld diagnostic. In April of this year, we introduced Apollo, our midrange handheld. With those new products, we further differentiate our offerings from competitors by giving professionals access to our intelligent diagnostics features and our proprietary databases in a handheld. Early sales have been strong for both models, and as I've said previously, the data packaging feature has been a big plus. And when you put those advancements together with a continuous gains being registered by Mitchell 1 one with its repair information software and with its shop management system, software sales at RS&I are also on the clear rise, matching the trend in vehicle repair and driving profitability. So to wrap up RS&I, you can say improving positions with repair shop owners and managers growth in diagnostics and information offsetting the other areas, organic sales are flat but profits and margins up nicely. Those were highlight of our quarter. Tools Group, still off, but improved. C&I reporting an overall strong performance especially in critical industry and RS&I expanding strength in diagnostic and repair information, progress along our runways for coherent growth and clear advancements down our runways for improvement, overall sales increasing organically by 1.3%. OpCo operating income margin of 20.2%, up 30 basis, EPS $3.12 in the quarter 20% higher than last year. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I will turn the call over to Aldo, Aldo. Aldo Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $954.6 million in the quarter increased 3.6%, reflecting 1.3% organic sales gain, $8.1 million of acquisition-related sales and $13 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter particularly reflects strong sales in critical industries and in diagnostics and repair information products. Consolidated gross margin of 51%, increased 70 basis points primarily due to benefit from higher sales and savings from RCI initiatives and 10 basis points of favorable foreign currency, partially offset by higher material and other costs. The operating expense margin of 30.8% compared to 30.4% last year, primarily due to higher cost and 10 basis points of operating expenses from acquisitions, partially offset by 10 basis points of favorable foreign currency. As a result, our operating margin before financial services of 20.2%, improved 30 basis points from 19.9% last year. Financial services revenue of $82 million and operating earnings of $57.8 million increased 5.5% and 5.9% respectively from 2017. Consolidated operating margin of 24.2% of revenues improved 30 basis points from a year ago. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.8% was a decreased by 20 basis points as a result of a $500,000 tax benefit related to newly issued guidance associated with last year's U.S. tax legislation. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate for the quarter as adjusted was 24.0% and compared to 30.6% a year ago. Finally, net earnings of $178.7 million to $3.12 per diluted share compared to $153.2 million at $2.60 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding the aforementioned tax benefit, net earnings as adjusted was $178.2 million at $3.11 per diluted share, up 19.6% compared to last year. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7, sale of $337.8 million in the quarter increased 9%, reflecting a 4.4% organic sales gain, $8.1 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase primarily includes double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and a slight increase in our European-based and tools business, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in sales of power tools. Sales growth within the critical industries of business was broad-based across the end markets we serve, including both U.S and international aviation, natural resources, the military and technical education. Gross margin of 39.4% increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher sales volume in RCI, partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. The operating expense margin of 24.9% improved 20 basis points compared to last. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $49 million increased to 14% and the operating margin of 14.5% improve 60 basis points from 2017. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $411.9 million decreased 0.5%, reflecting a 1.5% organic sales decline, partially offset by $4.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease includes a low single-digit decline in the United States, while sales internationally were essentially flat. Although, sales were again lower year-over-year in the United States, the percentage decline was less than that experienced in Q1, reflecting some sales recovery in the United States due in part to a modest year-over-year increase in sales of tool storage. Gross margin of 45.9% improved to 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to 70 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects, higher sales of higher margin products and benefits for the Company's RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 26.7% increased 180 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the higher cost and the effect of the lower sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $79.0 million decreased 2.1% and the operating margin of 19.2% compared to 19.5% in 2017. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9, sales of $343.1 million increased to 1.5%, reflecting essentially flat organic sales and $4.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales level includes a mid single digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products, largely offset by a mid single-digit sales decrease of undercar equipment. Sales to OEM dealerships were essentially flat. Gross margin of 48.1% improved to 120 basis points primarily as a result of a shift in sales that included higher volumes of higher gross margin products and benefits from RCI, partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. The operating expense margin of 22.2% improved 40 basis points over the last year. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $88.7 million increased 7.9% from prior year levels. The operating margin of 25.9% improved to 160 basis points from last year despite the 20 basis points of negative currency effects. Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $57.8 million and revenue of $82 million increased to 5.9% and 5.5% respectively from year ago. Financial services expenses up 24.2 million increased 1.1 million, primarily due to an approximately 800,000 increase and provisions for losses on finance receivables, which totaled 13.6 million in the quarter. On a sequential basis, finance receivable provision expense was down $2.2 million from $15.8 million in the first quarter, reflecting some further stabilization in the portfolio credit metrics. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.2% in both the second quarters of 2018 and 2017. The average yield on finance receivable in the second quarter was 17.7% compared to 17.9% in 2017 driven principally by product mix. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.1% for both 2017 and 2018. Total loan originations of 276.1 million increase 5.5 million or 2% as a result of higher originations of contract receivables. Originations of finance receivables were down only slightly. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2 billion of gross financing receivables including 1.77 billion from our U.S operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $20.4 million in the second quarter, as for the 60-day plus delinquency trends, they are stable year-over-year and in the United States have come down sequentially from the first quarter, which we view as an indicator of further stability in the portfolio. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12 month bet losses of $51.5 million represented 3.17% of outstanding at quarter end, a 56 basis points year-over-year, but only 9 basis points sequentially, which is less than the sequential increases experienced over the last several quarters. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $186.9 million in the quarter, increased $59.8 million from comparable 2017 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings and an increase from net changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by investing activities of $63.7 million included net additions to finance receivables of 40.3 million and capital expenditures of $20.6 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $105.3 million included cash dividends of $46.3 million and the repurchase of 371,000 shares of common stock for $55.2 million under our existing share repurchase program. Year-to-date share repurchases totaled 646,000 shares for $98.7 million. As of the end of June, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $345.1 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables decreased $8.5 million from 2017 year-end levels due to $12.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency, day sales outstanding of 64 days improved by 2 days in 2017 year end. Inventories increased $29.5 million from 2017 year-end as a reminder, the year-to-date increase in inventory included $20.9 million related to the recognition of an inventory asset associated with the adoption of ASU Topic 606 on revenue recognition. On the trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns of 3.0 compared to 3.2 at year end 2017. By quarter end cash position of $112.3 million increased $20.3 million from 2017 year-end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio decreased to 23.7% from 27% at year-end 2017. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, we had $115.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-On's second quarter, Tools Group, still off but improving. OI margin at 19 .2%, one of its highest. C&I, the extension to critical industries continuing a positive trend. OI margin at 14.5%, up 60 basis points against unfavorable currency and unfavorable acquisition. RS&I sales flat but the gains in diagnostics and information driving OI margins to a very strong 25.9% up 150 basis points from last year. It all came together for an organic sales rise of 1.3%, overall OI margins of 20.2% and an EPS of 3.12 up 20%. And we believe, the trajectories demonstrated in the quarter, the progress of diagnostics, the gains in critical industries and rise of software are significant trends that bodes well for continuing progress along our runways for growth. We also believe that the results for quarter are strong testimony to the power of Snap-On value creation, especially customer connection innovation in RCI to drive significant profit and margin achievement even in challenged situations. This was an encouraging quarter, positive for the present and promising for the future. And we're confident that we have the products, the business models and the team to continue our positive trend throughout 2018 and beyond. Now, before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know many who are listening, the progress of the second quarter would not have been possible without your contribution for your achievements in delivering this performance, you have my congratulations and for your support of our efforts and your commitments to our team, you have my thanks. Now, let's turn the call over the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Liam Burke with B. Riley FBR. Liam Burke : Nick, you mentioned in the core Snap-On Tool Group, you saw a modest step up in storage sales from call stabilization. You were down organically. Can you give some color on how the hand tool business did? And how new product introductions went this quarter into the channel? Nick Pinchuk : Well, hand tools were off a little bit, not much, but slightly. You could call it in the low single-digit. So it's really kind of you would call it flattish sort of, but down a little bit for the arithmetic purposes. The introduction of the new 1422 that mid-tier tool storage unit, was its fairly buckle and it helped to ignite better tool storage. Tool storage was up slightly in the quarter. So we saw some come back off course just barely, but it was up in the quarter which has been our first up in awhile, so we feel pretty positive about that. And the new product introductions associated with diagnostic tended to drive some positivity. The hand tools business you know I referred to FDX, the new wrenching system, I mean the new socket system that we have, and we're very bullish on that, but it was introduce late in the quarter so it didn\u2019t make that much of a difference in this quarter. Diagnostics show some increases and software off course was up which helped drive profitability. The Tools Group margins, the 45.9 I think is maybe a all-time high. So those products were very good for us. Liam Burke : And you've mentioned in the C&I business you've had new introductions on the power tools side. The power tools were down in the quarter since just the timing of introduction and new products or is there anything in power tools that are proving to be challenging? Nick Pinchuk : No, the power tools on a C&I side rises or falls with the introduction in new product, and I talked about the PT650 which is the little sibling of something we produced last year. So one, in the quarters, we had somewhat earlier release last year of the big brother, the PT850, so you\u2019re up against that one, and this one came out I said I think in the late June. So you really didn\u2019t see an effect in that and you have that kind of disconnect. And of course, there is the question of power tools in C&I sales primarily itself externally but also sales big to the Tools Group. So there is a little bit of lag in terms of and disconnect between those two, going to inventory and selling that will sometimes drive differentiation in the quarter, but we think power tools has good things ahead of us because we like the power tools product that are coming out. We like the 650 and we like other things that will come out later in the year. Operator : Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Joe Vruwink : Hi this is Joe Vruwink for David. Maybe just wrapping up product discussion for the Tools Group, so diagnostic in the quarter, it sounds like the overall category between tools and RS&I was up by some amount where the diagnostics sales into that tool channel up as well. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, diagnostic, the handheld diagnostics were up low single digit to couple percent, the big thing is you know you got those big ticket but higher margins diagnostic units of Apollo and ZEUS. Now, we often say that they have to share the margins with RS&I, but Apollo versus its predecessor is higher margin, so that\u2019s why you're seeing the impact on margins. Joe Vruwink : And then, there has been quite of lot of work done in tool storage not just a new product, new feature at the mid-level as you've been renovating the Rock 'n' Roll cabs. Was that an ongoing effort through Q2, so that Q2 would necessarily reflect a full three months benefit from all of these items and really I know Q3 is tough because the other conference, but Q3 would really be the first quarter everything is consistently selling for three months? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, that\u2019s right, I mean, it wasn't ongoing and we\u2019re putting on the 3D modeler on the vans on the Rock 'n' Roll cabs. The Rock 'n' Roll cabs are I think our franchises continue to tell us they are very effective, so you'd be entitled to that. Now remember, I say and I say this every third quarter that our third quarter can be a little squirrelly because we have the conference and it depends how many days or guys in the field all those things. But you will see the full force of that product going on and that feature going on in the second half. So, we\u2019re pretty positive about that. Joe Vruwink : And when you set back and just think about because for the big ticket categories, diagnostic and tool storage, that\u2019s a pretty sharp rebound, higher compared to what the trend has been recently. When you think about just the new products that helped drive that, is it more than just a one quarter phenomenon? Are we looking at getting these products in front of the entire network and so we have three more quarters of benefit? Just how are you thinking about that? Nick Pinchuk : All I\u2019m thinking that we\u2019re going to have late because I mean we think, if you\u2019re talking about big ticket items, we think the diagnostics unit keep driving. And of course, if you think about this the driving of new software, you can look at the numbers about one third, let say software starts to increase dramatically because only single digits of the people were buying subscriptions. Now one, third of installed base was taking updates in a year. But when you do as ZEUS, more than 90% have taken a data package and Apollo closed to 90% have taken the data package. And those are subscriptions, and so those represent a significant portion of the installed base. So that's what driving -- that annuity out, there is what's driving the software growth in the Tools Group. And we see that going forward more than anything and as well as the further sales of those. And then we have new products ready to rollout as well. Now, one of the things I will tell you that I think has good legs as to socket wrenching system, so I think that will keep going. Joe Vruwink : And then last question from me so, obviously, these big ticket products are supported by Snap-On credit, and the portfolio has really done a nice job and kind of normalizing, so the improve -- the increase I should say in delinquencies, you are seeing that slow to pretty I would say normal levels. When you think of about supporting growth in these products on a go forward basis, will it be your expectation that the risk of the customer buying these products is pretty comparable to the current portfolio, so not so much and an increase in provision or delinquency is associated with this growth? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, I'd say that. I think that's right. I mean I think the business is pretty well balanced now. I think like I said, like we said many times in many calls, the credit system is a kind of self-correcting system and it continually corrects both by us and by the franchisees. We think they are in a good spot now. Actually, we think the system is pretty balanced. You see originations kind of matching what big ticket is. You see sales by us matching or actually sales off the van are better than sales, our sales to the vans themselves. So, this makes for pretty good balance at least in a short-term. We feel pretty positive about where the Tools Group is. Now, I'd like to see growing off course, but it's certainly better than last quarter. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Question on the 1422. I guess the new tool storage lines, are the margins comparable in that mix versus the old tools storage categories? Nick Pinchuk : Better. Bret Jordan : Okay, and I guess because it seems like it's more content that you've been adding to, is this just you are passing that through [indiscernible]? Nick Pinchuk : Look at the gross margin, 3 basis points. The thing is -- I think that's the most the telling thing. We're selling these products for that given away I mean fundamentally that's what RCI is about, customer connection innovation, rolling our products more content, getting your price and also being able to control your cost in the phase of even material changes. Bret Jordan : Okay. Nick Pinchuk : 45.9, I believe, now we are not for sure, I think it's an all time high but it feels good. Bret Jordan : Okay, so that was not just software driving margins higher? Nick Pinchuk : The software was a factor, but it wasn\u2019t just software. The icons -- the 1422 is higher margin. Bret Jordan : That's perfect. Aldo Pagliari : And then, the franchisee of that or anything particularly new is going to be rolled around that sort of the catalyst. Nick Pinchuk : But I'm not announcing it on this call. So, yes, we will roll out some things I think, and it looks like it's been better attended than at least for registrations right now better attended than ever before. Bret Jordan : And then just as housekeeping and within C&I, what percentage is now critical industries, and I guess what of that critical industries is U.S versus international? Nick Pinchuk : Let's see, well, look critical industry and C&I is about 40%, I would say, for government work 40% and it's about 25% maybe 30% international, yes. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Just wanted a step back on some of the big ticket launches with Icon and Apollo and ask about the process of getting that into the channel. I think initially you might recognize revenue ahead of end purchase. I imagine the sell-through lacks, the initial channel fill little bit. But can you explain how that works? And where the second quarter lies on that process? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t know, I mean, this is like every other product, we sell it to the franchisee, they take it and we book the sale expect for -- that\u2019s for all the product and then we -- in the case of diagnostics products, we track what we call activations. So, we know right away when they sold into the industry. And so when I\u2019m saying these products are, we not only sold more to franchisees, but we know that they are selling better off the van than anyone than their predecessors. Because we see the activations because they have to come back to us to activate the software, so we have that. And then you know there is the whole data package question that appended to ZEUS and Apollo with the franchise sells that, but we don\u2019t book it, we amortize it over 36 months or 24 months depending on the period. And remember that, remember here that just to be clear, one of the things we monitor very clear is sales -- overall sales to end customers, for the quarter and for the year-to-date, the sales to end customers off the vans are higher than the sales and our sales to our franchisees. Christopher Glynn : That was for the overall Tools Group, right. Nick Pinchuk : Everything. Yes, everything, right, everything. Now, if you look at any particular product, particularly rolled out a new product of course it\u2019s a lack. There is the guys got to get trained, they got to socialize and we roll them out, regionally, so there is a lot of variation from product to product. But for sure, there is a significant -- we've been clear that deliver sales will be called, sales up vans have been for a long-term and clearly in the quarter, better off the vans and we sold to them and therefore the inventories are shrinking. Christopher Glynn : Okay and then on the stories, congrats on getting that up in the quarter. As I understand that the second quarter comp might have been especially easy in the second half what in 17 wasn't down quite as much. So, what would be some wisdom you might impart as we think about that? Nick Pinchuk : See, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think I worry so much about those comps. I think this quarter was -- if I look at the absolute amount size, I was encouraged by the absolute amount of these quarters. So I'm not so concerned about rolling into whether the third quarter or the fourth quarter was down or up. I'm looking for a positive so sequential and year-over-year improvement. However, I will again say that our third quarter was always squarely because you don\u2019t know how many weeks or how many days the franchise is going to sell, and it's always been so and I've said so on every call that I've faced the third quarter. But we're optimistic going forward, we see like I said, we saw some improvement and we do see opportunities going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Nick, I think this is important question here and I don\u2019t know how you can maybe break it out for us. But it seems that with a lot of these new products that putting out and with data and more software being sold subscriptions. Can you give us an idea of just what percentage of the sales that you are doing right now, encompass data and software versus where they were last year at this time and where you think they may be able to go? Nick Pinchuk : I can tell you this that the software sales in the Tools Group are up strong double digits. And the software sales in the sales group or maybe what would I say at quarter or quarter of diagnostic sales or maybe a third of diagnostic sales, so you can kind of triangulate around that time of thing. There are dribs and drabs in software at a lot of different places, but you can look at that. It's about a third of the diagnostic sales and we're up strong double digits in that particular. And so that is very profitable, if you pivot to the RS&I Group, software comprises about a third of that business, and we're up mid-single digits there, but it's a much boarder thing in a much different industry. There is a little bit of double pounding because they're selling into Tools Group. But it's still positive software, one of the cool things is our database is our common home, and they have given us better sales and that what's driving this kind of profitability. If you looked at our gross margins quarter, it's pretty strong. I usually don\u2019t talk about gross margin, but if you look at the overall businesses gross margin, I think it's an all-time high as well and it's being driven\u2026 Aldo Pagliari : I guess what I'm getting at is that, it seems that would more use to software, more use to data that there has been you are driving a little bit more a shift change in your product mix and that these gross margins at least not on a absolute number basis, but gross margin expansion should be sustainable as long as you keep selling these products and introducing new products. Is that kind of correct? Nick Pinchuk : Sure, I mean the thing is, just think of it this way. The balance in the Apollo and the ZEUS was that we package the software. The data package was appended to the hard body, and therefore a figure out-of-the-box place, so we list that higher prices for our customers, but we sold them in pretty bigger number than a predecessor and that created a bigger software streams which will keep recognizing. So, we don\u2019t recognize a portion of that higher price because we wait, we recognize it month-by-month. So what you are seeing is a growing amortization of that in some cases, in many cases. So you will see that sort of annuity coming home. Gary Prestopino : And then, is that fact that what you\u2019re doing with the software and data and all that, is that just because we're continuing to see more complexity in vehicles? I mean, is a lot of this being driven by the fact that you know maybe cars from 2010 on have more technology, more software and these mechanics need to have this? Nick Pinchuk : Exactly, they need that and like you say, 40% of the repairs in car, overall car park required diagnostic unit, 80% of the repairs in the new car required diagnostic units and only getting worse, it's getting more complex. And we have the best one, the 1 billion record data base for smart repairs and almost a 100 billion data base for decoding, some of the codes when you don\u2019t have an easy solution, people are liking that why they are buying these products at strong prices. Gary Prestopino : And then lastly. Nick Pinchuk : And responding to that trend, and we\u2019re the only ones who have the data. Gary Prestopino : That\u2019s important. And then lastly just on the, I know you doing a big refresh on the tool storage and with the vans and all that. Somebody may have asked this question, but I didn't quite get the answer. Where are you in that? Have you basically completed that or we still going to introducing more tool store unit and you have more tinkering with the van channel to go? Aldo Pagliari : Well, I'll let you know when we're growing at much bigger. We keep making tinker. We tinker all the time. We make changes all the time. So, we will keep changing the tool storage, but this is a big. Now, when we come up to an SFC, we do have changes associated with tools storage line. We roll it out 3,495 franchises get to see it and so, we kind be ready for that. So, you\u2019re seeing some of that changes going on. And if that doesn\u2019t work, we will keep tinkering. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : I\u2019m just trying to understand question on originations, Nick. Your finance receivables are down. Your diagnostics were up. Your storage is up. You've got software increase obviously. How you reconcile that with finance receivables being down? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I will let Aldo answer that. But I'll tell you -- part of it is -- that is fairly a direct correlation because there is a timing difference in lot of that. But Aldo, you want to\u2026 Aldo Pagliari : Yes, finance receivables are down 0.3%, so if you correlate that with the low single-digit, the increase in handheld diagnostics and full storage, and you\u2019re down a little bit in other products generally speaking. I think it triangles quite well, but there is that timing difference I think I mentioned. Right, but originations reflect sales of the franchisees off the van versus ourselves, but I think they triangulate very closely. David MacGregor : Maybe I could follow up with you offline on that, to try and better understand some of the puts and takes. On the originations, you were up 2%, driven by growth in contract receivables. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that growth? And how much of that is for franchises purchasing larger trucks and just more inventory versus maybe other factors that are play there? Aldo Pagliari : That's a good portion of it is in fact van related when you have contract franchisees coming on board, when they start up or missing routes. Often times, they are financing to the end involve, but also there is some financing of working capital it's kind of normal, but that's been positive. David MacGregor : And then how the franchises inventory levels stand at present, specifically on big ticket stores and diagnostics? Nick Pinchuk : I think it's hard to specify individual pieces, but all I can tell you is, the sales off the vans are better than our sales to them. And so, that's being going on throughout the whole year. Now, franchise to franchisees, they may have more inventory or less inventory. I talked to franchisees who said both. I think you would say that, if it's a new product, they probably have more inventories than the less because they are rolling it out and they like to put it in front of customers. And when they see customers, they want to strike while the iron is hot. I think for stuff that's been around for a while, they have less inventory. David MacGregor : And then, you've noted your reported delinquencies were stable year-over-year. I guess that marks the first year-over-year stability in about 10 quarters at this point. Does Snap-On become more accommodated on credit at the end of the quarter so as this marked a more permanent change for credit policy? Aldo Pagliari : No, I don\u2019t think so. I think the policy -- we've again making some changes more at the beginning of the year and in middle of the year, but no change in that regard. I think what you are seeing is just an improvement in the base of activity and stabilization as I mentioned. Normally, you get sequential changes 0 to 10 basis points. This time, you saw a 20 basis points the improvement, if you look from Q1 moving into Q2. So I think this is overall stabilization. David MacGregor : On the SFC, I guess last two years ago you had a greater SFC. Last year, it was a little disappointing. What are you going to do differently this year to support the stronger sort of order growth performance? Are you revisiting the whole bundling strategy or maybe if you can talk a little bit about that? Nick Pinchuk : Sure, we learn something -- we do learn some things about the size that a hand tool bundles last year. We learned some things about the length of the [Indiscernible] speed, time period under which we were booking SFC orders. In other words, when you go to SFC, you could book orders out for delivery out through February. So this year, we're tightening that a little bit to be to make it more direct and understandable. I think our franchises like that and off course we are working harder on products. Now, we think I'd say what based on registrations, it seems like this is going to be a pretty good one. So, the first step is getting people there, it looks like that's going to happen. Now, we think we have to learn the lesson. We've learned some lessons of last year. We expect that to work, but that's the art of -- sort of the art of the presentation. David MacGregor : And then, you talked -- just to go back to tools for a second just quickly, your operating expenses in the tool segment were up 180 basis points. Can you just help us understand the main factors behind that increase? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, we're trying to sell more and we -- so investing in support in terms of people in the field, in terms training, when we roll out something like the Apollo or the ZEUS, hey, complicated now. So, you got to put more time in training and supporting our sales. Our guys just don\u2019t -- they have a lot of other products to worry about, so you have to supplement that and that drives a lot of that. So, it's not a surprise to me. If I close my eyes and I say and you told me that we rolled our products with intelligent diagnostics, and we have two of them in a field and then we rolled out a new different silhouette tools support box, which is again you want to sell the features and so. And we are talking about an FDX towards the end of the quarter which is new wrench, a new socket system. I would say we spent a lot of money trying to support that. David MacGregor : Will that continue with that level over the next couple of quarters? Nick Pinchuk : No, I think it depends on our feeling about how well our franchise and how well the training takes the first time. Usually, we're making assessment of that afterwards and we say, gee, do we need to roll some new market because our guys don\u2019t understand it at all. With products like this you want to make sure that both the seller and the customer appreciates the technology because as some people have said other people are offering cheaper stuffs. David MacGregor : Last question from me, you've talked about the higher materials and other cost as a negative to consolidate gross margins. I guess, how do you expect second half to defer from the second quarter experience in terms of different\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : No, I\u2019m not really sure. I\u2019m not sure. For example, steel prices, we buy steel in the U.S. Our steel, the Milwaukee sockets are made with U.S steel. All our hand tools are U.S. steel and they rose 30% in last 18 months. So, I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going to happen in the future. It's hard to say where there will be more or less. Certainly, we think we can manage it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Stember with C.L. King & Associates. Scott Stember : Can we just talk about RS&I, maybe just flush out, it looks like a diagnostic and software did well and the flatness really came from the undercar care or the under care equipment and flat OEM? Can you maybe just talk about I know there is lumpiness in the business, but maybe just talk about what\u2019s drove down in particular the undercar equipment side? Nick Pinchuk : That\u2019s a good question. I mean that is the question there. I mean the thing is the flatness to the OEM is generally driven by the chronic lumpiness of that business, and we\u2019ve seen it go up and down pass, the equipment business was all up. I think its mid single digits or low single in the quarter and that is the little worse than it's been. And you got a couple of effects one is that, we had a couple of in some of the peripheral pieces that business like break ways and so on, we had some pretty big distributions last year in terms of some major OEM that did create a headwind. And we had some difficulties around things like we change the deliveries associated with some of our in our collusion business and we had a little destocking with distributors. And around some of our lift factories had the same kind of things in terms of delivery. So, we had something that you could explain some of it. I think the rest of it is just, boy, it was a tepid quarter. So, we saw a tepid quarter and we had a couple of three things in there that you could make some explanation, but I don\u2019t think they added up to the whole downturn. Scott Stember : So, it sounds like probably two thirds of it was more transitory or at least some of it goes away? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, I mean I think it is our job is to try to six that. I mean we don\u2019t like it down there in that situation. So, we have to try to figure out how to deal with those -- the way we\u2019re dealing with the transitory stuff is couple of new products are rolling out. So some people might have been anticipating that and backing up. We've got some new products rolling out in a fall, so we will do that. We\u2019re going to take a look at that sourcing associated with the relationship with the distributors, and see if we can make sure that, it doesn\u2019t just throw us that air ball again. And so, that\u2019s all we do in that situation. Scott Stember : All right and on power tools, did you just talk about how that did within the tool segment? And how that affected the intercompany sales on C&I? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, look, the power tools business is up slightly in the Tools Group. Cordless tools sold pretty well in the quarter. You know that pneumatic that I talked about coming out of the C&I business was launched late, so wouldn\u2019t have any effect some on into the Tools Group. Generally, you saw the small tools that come from our Kunshan factory in China. The little 14.4 volts sell pretty well in the Tools Group, which created that positivity. And then, they were really selling down some of the inventory they had from prior distribution from the C&I business. And we expect that a little bit to change as new products rollout from C&I, but that sort of it. Tools Group had a reasonably positive hold in the right -- but positive, holding their own in cordless though, weaker in pneumatic in the marketplace. And but some of that was driven by our smaller like cordless power tools that come out of Kunshan therefore in this quarter, the C&I power tools factory in Murphy didn\u2019t benefit from it. Scott Stember : And just last question, you've talked about I guess the first salvo of tariffs that went out on steel and aluminum. Can you maybe just touch base on the last couple the $50 billion that were announced in 200 billion, how you guys can offset that going forward? Nick Pinchuk : I think, if you talked about products, generally, we are sourcing the markets from where we -- we're sourcing the markets where we sell, so we generally have a fairly positive profile versus those kinds of interruptions. And if we don\u2019t, we have the ability to move things around the resource. So when we look at the list of tariffs, we think we're pretty well positioned for those things, and those things that we are not, that's our job to make the difference. So at least that we look at it right now, we were not ringing our hands and worrying about them effectively. So, I think now things could change and things would be changing minute by minute with tariffs. So, I'm always saying to what I see right today and what's in place today we are okay. Operator : Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski for closing remarks. Leslie Kratcoski : Great. Thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. A replay of the call will be available shortly on our website. And as always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-On. Good day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference.

King & Associates David MacGregor - Longbow Research David Leiker - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated Gary Prestopino - Barrington Research Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Richard Hilgert - Morningstar Operator : Good day and welcome to the Snap-On Third Quarter 2018 Results Investor Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Leslie Kratcoski. Please go ahead. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks, Todd, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining Snap-on today to review our third quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-On\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-On\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we\u2019ll take your questions. As usual, we\u2019ve provided slides to supplement our discussions. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investor section. These slides will be archived on our website, along with the transcript of today\u2019s call. Any statements made during this call relative to management\u2019s expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management\u2019s or the company\u2019s outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and conference call slide deck, which can be found on our website. With that said, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Leslie. Good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll start with the highlights of our third quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see, and I\u2019ll take you through some of the turbulence we\u2019ve encountered and speak about our physical and financial progress. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financials. We believe that our third quarter again demonstrated Snap-on\u2019s ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming period-to-period variation. We are encouraged by the results. Like every quarter, we had disparities from group-to-group and within each group. The van business appears to have stabilized with incremental improvement in organic sales trend, sales gains in the U.S. offset by decline in other geographies. Some segments saw a down period with challenges in our businesses serving independent repair shop owners and managers and sales to OEM dealerships, but once again, our strength overcame. Organic sales in the quarter were up 0.6%. Sales gains in critical industries in the \u2013 in Asian Pacific, returned to growth in the U.S. van channel, progress in hand tools and power tools and the rise of software. That all combined to prevail against variations and move us forward again. OpCo operating margin of 19.3% was up from last year as adjusted by 70 basis points. Improved product mix across the group\u2019s, net positive foreign currency and again the benefits of Rapid Continuous Improvement, or RCI, they showed the way. Financial services operating income was 59.3% \u2013 $59.3 million. That grew $3.3 million from last year\u2019s $56 million. And that result combined with OpCo to raise our consolidated operating margins to 23.7%, up 90 basis points as adjusted. And excluding the one-time tax charge associated with the transition to the new U.S. tax legislation, adjusted EPS was $2.88, up 17.6%. Now let\u2019s speak about the markets. We believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable. We did see mixed results from our businesses in that arena, but based on what we\u2019ve been hearing from our franchisees, from technicians and from shop owners and managers, we believe the vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate and Snap-on, we believe we\u2019re well-positioned to take advantage. For the critical industries, verticals like aviation, oil and gas, mining and heavy duty, we\u2019re seeing significant progress, activity strong across \u2013 almost across the Board. We like the way the critical industries are sounding and trending. We had further advancements outside the U.S. Our Asia Pacific division registering solid increases in key countries like Japan and India and Indonesia. We do believe we\u2019re well-positioned to confront the challenges and make progress along our runways for growth. But at the same time, it\u2019s clear that we have great potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI. They are a constant driver of our progress, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology. And in this quarter, Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation drove significant margin gain in the face of turbulence. And led \u2013 and besides that, it led to more prestigious product awards than we\u2019ve ever had, more recognition than in any single year just this quarter. Snap-on was prominently represented with 18 Professional Tool & Equipment News, PTEN People\u2019s Choice Product Awards, where the actual users, the technicians make the selections, probably the best award. We were also recognized with seven PTEN Innovation Awards and we were honored with two MOTOR Magazine top 20 awards. An essential driver of Snap-on growth is innovative product that makes work easier. It\u2019s always been our strength and those recent awards have testimony, that great Snap-on products just keep coming driving progress. You can see it in the margins. Well, that\u2019s the environment. Now we\u2019ll move to the individual operating groups. Let\u2019s start with C&I. Sales of $330.2 million in the quarter. It increased $15.6 million, including $1.6 million related to acquisitions and $6.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth was 6.7%, gains across all divisions and most geographies. Operating margins reached 16.1%, one of C&I\u2019s highest, maybe the highest for C&I, representing a 10 basis point improvement from last year. That result reflects the power of our ongoing stream of innovative new products for critical industries, the product development investment necessary to build the future, a robust effort in RCI and favorable foreign currency. Let\u2019s take the industrial division, focused on critical industries outside the vehicle garage, it showed broad-based gains with strong overall year-over-year performance now accomplished for eight straight quarters. We continue to rise in critical industries and it\u2019s a favorable market environment that we\u2019re amplifying with innovative new products aimed at solving critical tasks and the result is very encouraging. The quarter saw advancements, driven by great products like our lineup of 14.4 volt cordless tools, spanning everything from ratchets to drills to wrenches to saws to screwdrivers. Each product developer customers both in and out of the garage, they\u2019re compact, they\u2019re powerful and they\u2019re flexible and the customers are noticing. All of them now include variable speed triggers for maximum control, micro lithium batteries that are lightweight and long-lasting, and those batteries are interchangeable between all the matching voltage Snap-on tools, micro lithium tools, lots of convenience in that. One of those tools is the CTR-767 14.4 volt, three-inch Drive MicroLithium Cordless Ratchet. It was released at the beginning of this year and it\u2019s one of MOTOR Magazine\u2019s top 20 tools. There\u2019s a long neck and extra six inches, jobs like timing belt changes or work near firewall, jobs that require reach, it makes them much easier, and there\u2019s a lot of those tasks across the workplaces of the world. And that extended neck doesn\u2019t compromise the leverage or power. The 767 especially rugged construction supports up to 40-foot pounds of torque output, while the robust ratchet mechanism head and neck and \u2013 can handle 158 foot pounds of manual torque. Three\u2019s a available speed trigger for greater control and can reach 275 RPMs. It has the torque to be versatile and that it has the speed to make quick work of the task. Our customer connection showed us what was needed to make ratchet work easier, speed, accessibility, torque, reach and strength and the CTR-767 has all of that. It\u2019s a different \u2013 it\u2019s a difference maker for working professionals in the market resection confirms it. You can see it in the power tool results. In this quarter, our City of Industry in California, the plant California torque operation introduced the Snap-on CTECH30 and the CTECH 240 Micro Torque Wrench, the smallest electronic torque wrenches in the market, compact steel bodies, only 10.2 inches in length and less than an inch in diameter, they\u2019re light \u2013 and they\u2019re light just under a pound. That compares to the standard torque wrench, which is 16.5 inches long and 1.9 inches in diameter and weighs nearly two pounds. The micro torques are designed for aviation, manufacturing and other critical industries, where tight spaces are common and light \u2013 and lightweight is important. The slim micro design enables text to reach fasteners that are resets and \u2013 or obstructed, often eliminating the need to remove components to gain access, saving a lot of time. The short overall length also enables a large swingarm, even in tight spaces, and that\u2019s a big factor for job productivity. And the micros have interchangeable head, that make them useful across a variety of applications for different fasteners and special situation, like those from all the time in aviation where accessibility and flexibility are critical. The CTECH micros are great tools and the technicians are responding. Products like these aimed at industry needs that help drive our progress across critical industry and keep working customer and we keep working customer connection and innovation. So the advancements will only continue. C&I maintaining its momentum, extending in critical industries, building both sales and profitability. Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales, about flat 0.1%, but returned to growth in the U.S. operation up low single digits. And that returned to growth was offset by variation internationally, that\u2019s the story of the Tools Group. Operating income in the quarter was $59.3 million, and that compares to $56.4 million in 2017. The OI margin was 15.2% and 80 basis point increase, favorable product mix, higher-margin new products, software, the benefits of RCI and the favorable foreign currency, they made the difference. Now the third quarter is, when we hold our annual Snap-on franchisee conference, our SFC. This year was Nashville and it was the largest Snap-on gathering in our 98-year history. With more than 8,800 attendees, franchisees, family members from over 3,100 routes. For the franchisees, it\u2019s an opportunity for training, promoting new products and for fun. For the company, it\u2019s an opportunity to gauge our franchisees outlook on the business. Order volume was up. Most product categories showing gains over last year. And I can attest that the franchisees displayed confidence in our business and optimism in their future. And that positive outlook is reinforced once again by the advancements evident in our franchisee health metrics. These are the financial and physical indicators we monitor and evaluate regularly. And they remain favorable and robust, it\u2019s a significant factor. We do believe our franchisees can continue to grow stronger. And if you are with us in Nashville, you could have seen it clearly. And our real reasons for that confidence, our product lines are getting stronger. You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that, there\u2019s a continuous stream of great new offerings, attention-getters of hand tools and tool storage. The third quarter was a strong hand tool quarter. You can understand why when you see innovations like our new TSLF 72 1/4 inch Drive Dual 80 Technology Speeder Handle Flex-Head Ratchet, a long name for a special product, aimed at decreasing job times and increasing technician efficiency in any shop. The speeder represents the fastest way to manually tighten or loosen fasteners. The flexible head provides access in tight automotive applications. And the Dual 80 Technology features a dual paw each with seven teeth 8 engaging the gears, so has great strength and [Technical Difficulty] enthusiasm, the kind that will make it another one of our hit products well, $1 million seller in the first year. [Technical Difficulty] C242, it\u2019s a 36-inch heavy-duty shop cart with five A/C outlets and two USB ports, a SpeeDrawer and a side panel organizer. It helps text organize and securely charge their tools and devices with tremendous ease. It offers two durable top options, stainless steel or bedliner, both popular features. And it comes in a variety of standard and newly released colors that make it differ. The KRSC242 has \u2013 it\u2019s already achieved its good products status, and we believe it has much more runway. Well, that\u2019s the Tools Group, enthusiastic SFC, the U.S. returning to growth and a substantial margin increase driven by innovative new products. Now RS&I. Organic sales were down 4.8%. Due to high single-digit decline in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Sales to independent shops were down, reflecting period of selling diagnostics to the van channel. No one who handhelds were launched in the quarter and the U.S. Tools Group growth \u2013 U.S. Tools grew in the quarter was achieved by franchisee focused on the great new products launched in other segments. And then sales to vehicle dealerships were also down in the quarter, reflecting fewer OEM programs in that lumpy business. Despite that variation, however, RS&I and OI margin was 25.7%, quite strong, a rise of 60 basis points from last year. Once again, RCI, innovation and software drove that progress. Our Mitchell 1 division continue to advances its industry-leading productivity solutions by introducing text message \u2013 a text messaging feature across the shop management line. It became clear that users see efficiency and having text messaging and capability integrated with the shop management software rather than relying on a general standalone third-party service. The new integrated feature offers the capability of sending customers automated reminder text about upcoming appointments, thank you notes for the repair business and invitations to participate in online surveys about their experience. The response has been overwhelming and positive, fortifying \u2013reinforcing and fortifying our leadership position in repair shop management software. And we launched other great products in the period like the Car-O-Liner. Our recent acquisition is one of the things we wanted to do with Car-O-Liner and we acquired it. Like the Car-O-Liner CT \u2013 so we launched the Car-O-Liner\u2019s CTR 9, fully automated spot \u2013 automatic spot welder. Our customer connection efforts showed that with expanding \u2013 with the expanding variation of steels now used in vehicle bodies, collision repairs taking on a new level of complexity. Technicians now spend considerable effort identifying and measuring the specific material before the welding \u2013 the specific materials they\u2019re working on before the welding can begin. It takes extra time and it\u2019s often a source of welding error. While the Car-O-Liner CTR 9 fixes all that. It measures thickness, determines the electrical resistance and identifies the exact steel being welded automatically. It brings unmatched speed and accuracy to the collision \u2013 to collision repair. It\u2019s a real productivity enhancement. We launched it in Europe at the Automechanika show to considerable enthusiasm and it will be introduced later this year in the \u2013 later this fall in the U.S. and we\u2019re confident it will be quite a hit voting good things for the Car-O-Liner future. RS&I minimizing the impact of sales variation with innovation, new product, technology and software. That\u2019s the highlights of our quarter. C&I continuing its positive trend of growth and profitability, extending across emerging markets in critical industries. Tools Group, reigniting the U.S. van channel in a registry margin strength. RS&I margin progress despite the challenges in the quarter. Progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement. OpCo operating income margin up 19.3%, up 70 basis points on an added \u2013 on an adjusted apples-to-apples basis. And an as adjusted EPS $2.88 in the quarter, 17.6% higher than last year. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results were summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $898.1 million in the quarter were down 0.6%, reflecting a 0.6% organic sales gain, $1.4 million of acquisition-related sales and $12.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter principally reflected broad-based growth in the Commercial & Industrial segment and low single-digit growth in the U.S. franchise operations of the Snap-on Tools Group. Consolidated gross margin of 50.5% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to a shift in sales mix, savings from RCI initiatives and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency, partially offset by higher material and other costs. The operating expense margin of 31.2%, compared to 32.8% last year, which included 170 basis points from the $15 million legal charge that was incurred during Q3 of 2017. As a result, operating margin before financial services of 19.3% was up 240 basis points on a reported basis and 70 basis points on an as adjusted basis, respectively, from Q3 of 2017. Financial services revenue of $82 million and operating earnings of $59.3 million increased 3.8% and 5.9%, respectively, from 2017. Consolidated operating margin of 23.7% of revenues was up 250 basis points on an reported basis and 90 basis points on an adjusted basis, respectively, from last year. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 24.0% included a charge of 90 basis points, or $1.8 million, related to newly issued guidance associated with last year\u2019s U.S. tax legislation. Excluding this charge, the effective tax rate for the third quarter as adjusted was 23.1%. This compared to a rate of 30.7% last year on an adjusted basis to exclude the 60 basis points of benefit from the legal charge. Finally, net earnings on a report of basis of $163.2 million, or $2.85 per share, compared to $133.4 million, or $2.29 per share a year ago. Excluding $0.03 per share for the tax charge, adjusted earnings per share was $2.88, up 17.6%, compared to Q2 \u2013 Q3 of 2017, adjusted per share of $2.45, which excludes the $0.16 per share legal charge last year. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $330.2 million in the quarter increased 5%, reflecting a 6.7% organic sales gain and a $1.4 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $6.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase was broad-based and included a double-digit gain in the sales of power tools, high single-digit gain in the sales of our Asia Pacific operations, a mid single-digit gain to customers in critical industries and slightly higher sales in the European-based hand tools business. Gross margin of 39.6% decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to higher sales volumes of lower gross margin products, principally in Asia Pacific and power tools, as well as higher material and other costs, partially offset by benefits from RCI and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency. The operating expense margin of 23.5% improved 80 basis points, primarily as a result of sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $53 million increased 5.4% and the operating margin of 16.1% improved 10 basis points from 2017. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $389.8 million decreased 0.7%, reflecting slightly higher organic sales growth more than offset by $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales change includes a low single-digit increase in the United States, largely offset by a high single-digit decline internationally. Gross margin of 43.6% improved 180 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to 50 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects, increased sales of higher gross margin products and benefits from the company\u2019s RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 28.4% increased 100 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to cost and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $59.3 million increased 5.1% and the operating margin of 15.2% improved 80 basis points year-over-year. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $314.4 million decreased 5.7%, reflecting a 4.8% organic sales decline and a $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The lower organic sales reflects a high single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products and a mid single-digit sales decrease in sales to OEM dealerships, while sales of undercar equipment were essentially flat. Gross margin of 48.7% improved 140 basis points, primarily as a result of a shift in sales that included lower volumes of lower gross margin products and benefits from RCI. The operating expense margin of 23% increased 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the effect of lower sales volumes. Operating earnings for the RC&I Group of $80.7 million decreased 3.7% from prior year levels. However, the operating margins of 25.7% improved 60 basis points from last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $59.3 million and revenue of $82 million increased 5.9% and 3.8%, respectively, from a year ago. Third quarter financial services expenses of $22.7 million were down slightly year-over-year, as higher operating expenses were more than offset by $700,000 and $400,000 of lower provision expense for financing contract receivables, respectively. On a sequential basis, total provision expense of $12.5 million was down $1.7 million from $14.2 million in the second quarter, reflecting further stabilization in the credit portfolio metrics. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1.2% in the respective third quarters of 2018 and 2017. The average yield on finance receivables in the third quarter was 17.7%, compared to 17.9% in 2017, driven principally by product mix and reflective of the credit quality of customers originating loans in the quarter. Respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% for both 2017 and 2018. Total loan originations of $267 million decreased 1.8%, primarily due to a 2.1% decline in originations of finance receivables. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.8 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $35.6 million in the third quarter. As for the 60-day plus delinquency trends, they are stable year-over-year and increased sequentially reflecting typical seasonality. As it relates to extended credit for finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12-month net losses of $52 million represented 3.18% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 41 basis points year-over-year, but essentially flat sequentially, further supporting continued stabilization in the portfolios credit metric performance. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $129.8 million in the quarter increased $34.3 million, or 35.9% from comparable 2017 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $48.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $22.7 million and capital expenditures of $29.9 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $71.3 million included cash dividends of $46.1 million and the repurchase of 493,000 shares of common stock for $85.7 million under our existing share repurchase programs. Year-to-date, share repurchases totaled 1.139 million shares for $184.4 million. As of the end of September, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $306.5 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $3.1 million from 2017 year-end, including $14.5 million of unfavorable currency translation. Days sales outstanding of 65 days improved one day from 2017 year-end. Inventories increased $51.8 million, including $15.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency from 2017 year-end. As a reminder, the year-to-date increase in inventory included $20.9 million related to the recognition of an inventory asset associated with the adoption of accounting standards update Topic 606 on revenue recognition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.8 compared to 3.2 at year-end 2017. Our quarter-end cash position of $122.2 million increased $30.2 million from 2017 year-end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio increased \u2013 decreased to 23.8% from 27% at year-end 2017. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter-end, we had $154 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-on third quarter. Turbulence and variation across some of our businesses, but we overcame and made progress. The U.S. Tools Group return to growth continuing on its improving trend. C&I extending to critical industry is achieving progress across all its operations. RS&I did encounter challenges, but there are positive points throughout that operations, particularly in the information and software. And with all that, margins were up again in each group. C&I 16.1%, up 10 basis points, possibly the best ever. Tools 15.2%, up 80 basis points and RS&I 25.7%, up 60 basis points against the wins. And our overall margin, it was 19.3%, up 70 basis points, all demonstrating again the power of Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation offering profitable new product and RCI creating productivity, runways for improvement that drive margin consistently. It was an encouraging quarter. And we believe the results of the period confirm that Snap-on has the opportunities to progress, the capability to take advantage and that team to improve even in difficult environments. And we\u2019re confident that those qualities spread across our operation will drive continued progress through the end of this year and on through 2019. Before I turn the call over to the operate, I\u2019ll speak to our franchisees and associates. I know you\u2019re listening. Encouraging performance of this quarter reflect your skill, your intensity and your contributions to our company, for your encouraging achievements, you have my congratulations, and for your unrelenting and unfailing support for our team, you have my thanks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning. Christopher Glynn : Nick, you sounded pretty confident and excited about the new product lines getting stronger at SOT. I\u2019m wondering if you would note that, that translates to improving visibility for the Tools segment to get back into the target growth range in the short order? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, I think, look, it certainly looks like it\u2019s going to trend that way. And we\u2019ll \u2013 based on what we hear from the franchisees, we see the impact of the new product in the quarter and we saw the SFC. The SFC was very enthusiastic. Now that\u2019s a windshield survey. It\u2019s kind of a qualitative view. But I will tell you, the \u2013 if you\u2019ve walked around that floor and I\u2019ve never seen it busier. And the \u2013 while the \u2013 all the product lines, we saw we had a muted results in diagnostics, which we explained everything was fairly strong. So the response of the SFC to the new product was good. Now that isn\u2019t selling on to the end users, that\u2019s the franchisees like the product, the power tools and the hand tools and the tool storage. Now we saw some of that come through though in the third quarter, reflecting much of that. So I feel pretty good about this. Christopher Glynn : Yes. And what about the international? That wasn\u2019t a slim negative and it sort of seem to come a little bit out of the blue? Nicholas Pinchuk : I\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ve said for a long time that the third quarter was kind of a variable quarter and that\u2019s particularly true in our international businesses because of the way the vacations run through that. And then they go back and actually \u2013 now we did this. You go back and look at the third quarter, there\u2019s a lot of variations in the third quarter \u2013extreme variations in our third quarter in the \u2013 in those international businesses and then a couple of those lined up this time in the same direction and that created this kind of variation and turbulence. Christopher Glynn : So you\u2019re not concerned about that in terms of trends? Nicholas Pinchuk : I\u2019m not really concerned about that. I think, I have said often that the third quarter, particularly in international, isn\u2019t a trend driver. You can\u2019t really \u2013 particularly outside the United States, you can\u2019t fully bank on that being a trend. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : We\u2019re not really concern about that. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And last one, also sticking with the Tools segment. I\u2019m just wondering if you are able to track the aftermarket among franchisees with their route customers. And if you think at the margin that kind of recirculation of aftermarket tools is maybe becoming a bigger piece in the franchisees\u2019 stock and trade? Nicholas Pinchuk : You mean second hand tools? Christopher Glynn : Yes. Nicholas Pinchuk : Is that what you mean? I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think so. I mean, that they\u2019ve always been there. I mean that \u2013 we don\u2019t see that increasing. I\u2019m not hearing that, so I don\u2019t really believe that to be the case. I mean, certainly, it\u2019s been always a factor in diagnostics and tool storage, the bigger ticket items. But I don\u2019t see anything that tells me that, \"Boy, that\u2019s a bigger number.\" I just spoke to a couple of franchisees a couple of days ago. And they didn\u2019t seem to mention that they were very robust about our product line, including the diagnostic product line, yes. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Stember with C.L. King. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning. Scott Stember : Can we maybe touch on the RS&I? Last year, in the third quarter, I think you posted a high single-digit organic sales number and... Nicholas Pinchuk : [Multiple Speakers] Scott Stember : Yes. That was it, yes. And you\u2019ve always warned that it\u2019s a lumpy business. How much of it is difficult comps, lumpiness, maybe just give us a little bit more detail? I think you also\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : That\u2019s certainly some of it. Look, I think, there are two big factors in diagnostics really driving the reduction in this quarter. One is \u2013 the easy one to deal with is the sales, our OEM programs business, where we get essential tool programs commissioned by OEM manufacturers, and that is quite lumpy, and driven by technology, new launches and regulation of those things and that tends to go up and down. We had a particularly strong couple of quarters last year, where we got a lot of those programs coming out of the OEMs. And we\u2019re in a period and particularly this period where there\u2019s a few \u2013 a smaller number of those, and so that creates a comparison vacuum. And then you look at \u2013 really if you want to talk about comparison and we had, I think, maybe our first or second best diagnostics quarter ever last year, because we launched the ZEUS at the end of the quarter. And so we had a great product launch, good SFC, lots of enthusiasm. And so comparing to that, it wasn\u2019t \u2013 I hate to talk about year-over-year comparisons, but that\u2019s part of the thing. That\u2019s part of what drives that. Now remember, the Tools Group still grew even though it\u2019s diagnostics didn\u2019t. It sold other things. And really what happened at the SFC is, we didn\u2019t have new product and we had an edge in diagnostics. We had great new products in tool storage and hand tools and power tools and other things. And so people paid attention to those. That\u2019s really the tail of the tape in this situation. Scott Stember : And can you maybe speak to the visibility that you have, I guess, in the upcoming quarters with some of these larger programs of the OEMs? Would you expect anything to pop-up? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, we don\u2019t really give guidance, but boy, it seems to be on the floor right now. So I kind of believe this is that, the industry keeps being robust in automotive sales in the United States in North America. So we would expect some recovery off of these as we move forward. In fact, I\u2019m confident of that. The time constants of that, I\u2019m not sure of, but I\u2019m pretty confident that, that happens. These things happen from time to time. You see ebbs to flow, which is why we classified a lumpy business. We\u2019re not actually concerned about it, but it does \u2013 if it lines up with something like diagnostics having a muted quarter, you end up getting the results you have. But I still think \u2013 I like to think that RS&I did a great job, 25.7% is the second highest OI margin ever for diagnostics. Scott Stember : All right. And just \u2013 last question just, so it sounds as if you\u2019re still comfortable with the \u2013 I guess, the long-term growth rate of the business, which I think you\u2019ve said in the past is in that mid-single-digit range. That hasn\u2019t changed, correct? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, no, that really hasn\u2019t changed. I mean, we had, like you said, we had an eight last year. In fact, we had a pretty good year, maybe five quarters or four quarters. It was a little bit over the range 7% to 8%. I always said that I thought it was a 5% business and it kind of came back a little bit, but it\u2019s those specific reasons why that. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re ringing our hands on this at all. When you talk to franchisees, they like this \u2013 our product. Scott Stember : Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Good morning, everyone. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning. David MacGregor : Yes, congratulations on the SFC. It sounds like you were pretty pleased with attendance. I\u2019m just wondering what did the shorter SFC fulfillment window contribute to third quarter Tools segment growth? Nicholas Pinchuk : It\u2019s hard for me to say that. I mean, we \u2013 you\u2019re saying that we \u2013 but let me make sure you\u2019re asking what. So fundamentally, we didn\u2019t drive SFC orders out into next year. We kind of let them be through December and then \u2013 for government work, and then not so much into the next year. That\u2019s we \u2013 I think we talked about that on the other call. I\u2019m not sure how much that really contributed. So I guess, if you do the arithmetic and you say, \u201cOkay, you compare year-over-year and as we did, you would say you did better than last year in your SFC orders. And you did better, because it was a shorter \u2013 and it was spread over fewer months, you would think you would contribute to that arithmetically, right?\u201d And so I think that\u2019s true. But that to me that was tremendously encouraging, because we had less \u2013 we \u2013 our guys, when they were ordering, we\u2019re thinking of less time to be able to liquidate this kind of product. So we felt pretty good. I think that was a real positive for us. David MacGregor : Okay. Within the Tool segment, how did the size of the average ticket compared to third quarter a year ago? And also maybe how did the number of transactions compared to third quarter a year ago? Nicholas Pinchuk : Say that first part again, David, please? David MacGregor : Sure. Within your Tools segment in your U.S. business, how did the size of the average ticket \u2013 sales ticket that your guys grow? How did that compare year-over-year? And then also\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : Look, I think it\u2019s probably a little smaller. I think, RA was \u2013 what we call RA, the smaller ticket items and hand tools was very strong and power tools are very strong. So the thing is, if you \u2013 how we interpret these things is we roll off the product and hand tools was very strong off the SFC. I think you felt this yourself, but power tools was also very strong and we kind of get this reinforcement. And those two are generally smaller ticket items. Although you can have a big ticket item in a power tool depending on which one it is, generally, the smaller ticket items. David MacGregor : Okay, but the number of transactions perhaps? Nicholas Pinchuk : It\u2019s got to be. I mean, the thing is, their sales were \u2013 they are deliberate. The sales off the van were about the same as the U.S. sales, so they were up about the same. So if they\u2019re selling those, those hand tools and power tools and then the number of transactions are higher, I think, that\u2019s probably true. David MacGregor : It just looks from me\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : I haven\u2019t looked at it pay to myself. I\u2019m just extrapolating logically. David MacGregor : Right, that makes sense. If organic sales remained slow, are you likely to respond with acquisition growth, or is it possible we could see an extended period of below target growth? Nicholas Pinchuk : I think, we\u2019re coming back. I think, the Tools Group has started to solve its problems. I mean, if you look at the U.S., everybody was focused on that like a heat-seeking missile and it grew at 2.4% in the quarter. And I think we would say not where we wanted to be, but a lot better than it\u2019s been. So it appears to me, you would conclude that if you look at the history of the last three quarters in the Tools Group, it\u2019s got better every quarter. The second derivative of its growth has gotten better. So I think, we\u2019re going back towards there. The RS&I situation, we see as a positional thing, and C&I has been doing pretty well. David MacGregor : Yes. One more if I could there. [Multiple Speakers] Nicholas Pinchuk : I see it. David MacGregor : How did your storage business compare year-over-year? Nicholas Pinchuk : Storage business in the quarter \u2013 the \u2013 was about flat, down slightly. So it\u2019s kind of flat. The SFC was good though. The SFC was stronger. So, it takes a while sometimes for that stuff to work its way through the system. So that\u2019s kind of what we saw in the storage business. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : \u2026 David Leiker with Baird. David Leiker : Good morning, everyone. Nicholas Pinchuk : Hi, David. David Leiker : Nick, if we look at on the international side of Snap-on tools, I mean, you saw primarily in three regions. Are you suggesting all three of them struggled a bit in the quarter? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m suggesting \u2013 I can tell you that. two or the three struggled in a quarter. One was up. We \u2013 I think, that sort of what I was saying in the prior call. This time a couple of them lined up negatively. We always see a lot of variation in this quarter. And thankfully, it\u2019s been mostly more \u2013 sometimes positive, sometimes negative, but this time, we had two negatives line up. So that\u2019s what drove this kind of thing. I don\u2019t think we see anything in this. So we\u2019re thinking it\u2019s just the \u2013 just third quarter. David Leiker : And then in the diagnostics and information, you seem to be saying that\u2019s more of a comp issue versus last year and I think you had said ZEUS launch in that. If you look at it sequentially, is there \u2013 what\u2019s the tone of business in that, and that\u2019s part of RS&I? Nicholas Pinchuk : I think \u2013 look, I think, the tone of business was about \u2013 was down somewhat, because you\u2019re getting further from the product launch of Apollo, which was the beginning of the second quarter. I think, the situation was one, comparison to itself year-over-year; and two, comparison to being in front of all these other product lines that we\u2019re launching at its primary stage, which is the SFC. Remember, the thing is that, the diagnostics business has only a few SKU, a relatively small number of SKUs. So when you launch a new product, if it is at the SFC, it gets a lot of attention. When you launch a new hand tool, it\u2019s one of many. We\u2019ll launch a new power tool, it\u2019s one of many. So those tend to reap of the SFC or the kick off. So at the SFC, I think, we had a set of compelling new product \u2013 new products associated with power tools and hand tools and they captured the attention of the people, and we just didn\u2019t have anything new. And so in diagnostics and so that tended to be a little bit of mute. And it was comparing to last year, which was kind of a pretty strong quarter. David Leiker : Okay. And then if we look at\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : [Multiple speakers] David Leiker : Okay. And then if we look at the Snap-on credit, the provisions are a little bit lower. Was that just kind of mark in the market with what your actual experience is or something else there? Aldo Pagliari : So I got it, David. So it\u2019s reflective. There has been attenuation of losses. There\u2019s less charge-offs for the provision that\u2019s required to be a little bit less. So sequentially, you see improvement. Now, again, if you look at the absolute year-over-year, it\u2019s still higher, but sequentially it\u2019s been improving and the trends there are going in the right direction. David Leiker : And then just one more number question, the corporate expense number came out a little bit light, good thing, but that helped the margin there a bit, anything in particular there? Aldo Pagliari : No, mostly it\u2019s the legal expense if you look at year-over-year. Our tendency is still \u2013 corporate expenses per quarter run between $20 million to $25 million. You\u2019re right, this year we\u2019re at the lower-end of that range. Last year, if you look and exclude the legal charge, you see we fell at about 23-ish or something like that. So nothing really has changed there. David Leiker : Okay, great. Thank you much. Aldo Pagliari : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington. Gary Prestopino : Hi, good morning, everyone. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning, Gary. Gary Prestopino : Nick, most of the questions have been answered. But I guess, could you maybe talk about, you mentioned that in the conference in Nashville, orders were up a certain magnitude. You \u2013 could you maybe give us a range of what those orders were up vis-\u00e0-vis last year? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Look, they ranged \u2013 they really ranged from high-single digits to, in fact, some people were double digits to a couple, we would say, mid single digits or maybe edging on both single digits. It\u2019s a pretty strong quarter. Diagnostics was not up, but everything else is pretty, pretty strong. Gary Prestopino : Right. And that was all hand tools and power tools, right? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, power tools. We have other things like compressors and air conditioning units. We sell things like that. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then\u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : Tool storage. Gary Prestopino : Tool storage, okay. And then given what we\u2019re seeing as far as the \u2013 you mentioned some of the lumpiness in the diagnostic business as you had tough comps and no new products. Is that really portend that, that this is more driven by new product introductions with that business/ Nicholas Pinchuk : Look, I think the answer is unfortunately a little more complicated than that in this quarter. It is driven by new product introduction. So when you introduce a new product, particularly intelligent diagnostics, which electrified everybody. Gary Prestopino : Right. Nicholas Pinchuk : The thing is those things tend to be tough comps. But then when you compare it, like I said, in an atmosphere of the SFC, where everybody else is laying out their best \u2013 putting their best foot forward and diagnostic has already introduced two in less than a year. That\u2019s the kind of thing you see. Now you still see sell-through in the Apollo, both the Apollo and the ZEUS did better than their predecessors. They\u2019ve rolled out better than their predecessors, but it\u2019s just that situation of ZEUS lapping last year\u2019s incandescent introduction is one of our best diagnostic quarter, maybe the best diagnostic quarter ever. And the idea that they\u2019re up against for a franchisee attention, some of these other products that simply is. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then really, I think, you might have mentioned this, but the feedback from your franchisees is that the environment is still pretty positive in the automotive? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Yes, I mean, like I said, I keep talking to them and they keep saying, yes. They\u2019re talking about two-bay shops now expanding to four, people being robust. Now if you look at the BLS data in terms of the amount of spending on car repair and the technician wages are all favorable. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning. Bret Jordan : On the diagnostics question, and I guess, you said incandescent launch of ZEUS, is the trajectory of Apollo, I guess, lower than the launch trajectory of ZEUS? And is that part of the diagnostics challenge? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, I don\u2019t think so. I think, look, I think, ZEUS was \u2013 the reason I may regret using the word incandescent. But look, I \u2013 it was a big launch, because it\u2019s the \u2013 everybody got excited. It was the first time we talked about intelligent diagnostics. So that was the roll out of the $100 billion database. And so that got everybody talking more. I think that\u2019s more or less that. Both of the \u2013 both of those products have exceeded their predecessors and their predecessors were pretty successful. Bret Jordan : Okay. Nicholas Pinchuk : ZEUS is \u2013 and the other thing Bret is that, ZEUS is a higher price point. Bret Jordan : Right. Nicholas Pinchuk : So you got our guys out there pounding away at a $12,000 price point. It tends to distort the situation. Everybody gets really excited a little bit more. It\u2019s as qualitative as that, I think, but the Apollo was just successful. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question, obviously, we talked a lot about tariffs, now you\u2019re relatively immune to that, given your low country of origin or your local manufacturing. But I guess, if you think about the assembly of the contents and its country of origin, do you see any pressure on your input costs? And I guess, as you think about the inverse of that, how do you stack up relative to your competition in your mix of imported assemblers versus theirs? Nicholas Pinchuk : It \u2013 I can\u2019t speak for the competition. But look, I think we make quite a bit of what we sell off those vans in America. We say like 75%, 80%. So we have a lot of U.S. competition. But don\u2019t \u2013 when I say, we have a thin wedge relative to other people versus peers. Don\u2019t mean, we\u2019re completely going to hit them, but we\u2019ve been dealing with material costs for [indiscernible]. I mean, our \u2013 we\u2019ve been giving salary increases. For example, people are talking about labor increase. We\u2019ve been given pretty robust salary increases for a decade to everyone and been managing it. We\u2019ve been absorbing it, except for the people in this room. And then we\u2019ve been \u2013 we have seen material costs. For example, we source U.S. Steel, but U.S. Steel rose, I think, 30% in the last 18 months and we\u2019ve absorbed it. We have some of it in our P&L this time, but our margins were up 70 basis points. Bret Jordan : All right. Thank you. Nicholas Pinchuk : So I think, you will see some of this in the future, but I think, we\u2019ll have to deal with this. Maybe I\u2019ll be explaining on our future call that we got zinged by some of it, but I think this is part of what we do is manage this. And one of the things we have, Bret, that\u2019s different is, I think, we\u2019re quite vertically integrated. So we have a lot of opportunity for RCI because of that vertical integration. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Richard Hilgert with Morningstar. Nicholas Pinchuk : Richard? Richard Hilgert : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning. Richard Hilgert : The RS&I group, is there \u2013 you talked about how we\u2019re seeing some expansion out there going from two-based, four-based that kind of thing. So there\u2019s this potential for more investment out there. Is there anything out there on the horizon that causes somewhat some uncertainty among general managers and shop owners that might cause them to curtail any of their spending? Is there any of that out there anywhere? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, I don\u2019t think in the independent repair shops. I think, those tend to roll pretty well. I mean, I think, over the years I\u2019ve seen them tend to be robust. Of course, people get different views. And during the recession, they were cash rich and confident. So something can happen to puncture their balloon of confidence, but I don\u2019t see it right now. For OEM dealerships, they can ebb and flow depending on how good and I guess, new car sales are. But one of the great thing is that, the movement towards information and data and software is moving in a direction that plays in our advantage. And we see one of the stories behind our market is that our software business keeps growing. The software content keeps growing. Software the Tools Group was up significantly because of the intelligent diagnostics products of ZEUS and Apollo and some other things. And software growth in Mitchell 1 are repair information and shop management is up again. So the RS&I software grow. So component of our margin gain is \u2013 part of it is our software business is growing and that\u2019s contributing to margin rate. Richard Hilgert : That\u2019s great, and that\u2019s a great segue for my next question. How \u2013 on your revenue for each of your groups, you have your organic growth. You have your impact from acquisitions and your impact from currency. On your margins, with revenue being slightly softer, that would convey to me potential negative operating leverage for your margin. But then you\u2019re offsetting it, part of that coming from the mix of products, some of that software. Is there anyway to quantify, here\u2019s how negative the operating leverage was? Here\u2019s how positive the impact from software is, or here\u2019s how positive the impact of RCI is? Do you have any kind of information you can or color you can give us on that? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, that\u2019s kind of a more detail. I will say, look, over \u2013 I\u2019ll just give you a little bit of thought. We\u2019re up 70 basis points as reported. 30 basis points was currency and we had some bad news associated with \u2013 the volume wasn\u2019t down. The volume was still up on an organic basis. So on an apples-to-apples basis, it\u2019s still up. So we didn\u2019t have any deleveraging in that. We had some material cost increases. We had some other cost increases associated with the SFC. So you\u2019re ending up with RCI and margin mix is about equal to the 70 basis points, a little bit better than 70 basis points that you had overcome in some of that bad news. Richard Hilgert : Okay, great. Thank you. Nicholas Pinchuk : Okay. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we have no more questions. I\u2019ll turn it back to Leslie Kratcoski. Leslie Kratcoski : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. A replay of the call will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we appreciate your interest. Thanks a lot. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Sara Verbsky. Please go ahead. Sara Verbsky : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's fourth quarter results, which are detailed in our press release, issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer, as well as on our website snapon.com under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website, along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise state management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures including a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and conference call slide deck, which can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today I'll start with the view of our fourth quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see, take you through some of the turbulence we've encountered and speak about the progress we've made. As usual, Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of the financials. Results for the quarter, for the full year, this time include a number of special non-recurring legal tax and debt events that affected our as-reported levels. So to provide greater clarity, we're going to refer to amounts excluding those onetime effects as an as-adjusted number to make everything comparable from an overview level. And when you look through it all, Snap-on did see external turbulence in a number of areas but we offset those challenges by and large and make what I think is recognizable progress. We saw disparity from group to group and within each group, but overall we're encouraged by our position for going forward. Fourth quarter sales of $952.5 million as reported were down 2.3%, including $17.1 million or 180 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency, much different than the beginning of the year. Organic sales were about flat down 0.6%. Generally shortfalls in the OEM dealership arena and in our international franchise businesses, including the U.K. were about offset by gains in critical industries, our Asia Pacific region and the beginning growth in the U.S. van channel. From an earnings perspective, our OpCo operating income for the quarter, including the onetime benefit from a legal settlement and an offsetting impact of unfavorable foreign currency effect was $182.1 million, increasing 15.3% compared to last year, which also included legal impacts. OI margin for the quarter, as reported, was 19.1%, up 290 basis points. On an as-adjusted basis, excluding the non-recurring items the OI margin was 18.7% compared with 19.4% in 2017. For financial services, operating income of $56.1 million was up compared to last year's $54.4 million. As reported OI margin including both the financial services and OpCo was 23%, up 290 basis points. The as adjusted OI margin was 22.6% compared to the as adjusted 23.1% recorded last year. So we're trying to give you a comparable on this. Quarterly as reported EPS of $3.09 was $0.85 or 37.9% above last year's. On an as-adjusted basis, the EPS was $3.03, exceeding the $2.69 from last year by $0.34, an increase of 12.6%. Those are the numbers. Now let's speak about the markets. Well, we believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable. Having said that though and in the area of serving vehicle OEMs and dealerships, we have seen some pause. We think that's likely associated with the multiple forecasts for lower new car sales and the uncertainty that often the companies they transition from a strong vehicle industry to a more moderate sales environment. Based on our past experience though, it's not clear how long that uncertainty continues. Lower new car sales can also ignite greater interest in dealer and dealership repair activity. On the other hand, we've been hearing from our franchisees and from technicians and from the shop owners themselves that there's considerable optimism in the independent repair -- that the optimism in the independent repair shops is strong and unaffected by those the latest OEM forecasts as you might expect. So we believe vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate. For critical industries, we're seeing progress, significant progress, strong activity in aviation and general industry. In that arena for us, calendarization of orders can create variation from quarter-to-quarter, but our overall activity trend continues to look quite promising. We do like the trajectory in critical industries. It's very positive. And that positive extended across our C&I group including Asia Pacific, double-digit growth and as seen in the Europe showing mixed, but positive results across the continent more than offsetting the clear impact of Brexit. We do believe we're well positioned to confront the challenges of this particular period and to make progress along our runways for growth. We're also confident that we have continuing potential on our runways for improvement Snap-on Value Creation Processes, Safety, Quality, Customer Connection, Innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement. They're constant fuel for our progress especially customer connection understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation matching that insight with technology. We believe -- I'm going to talk about little bit, we believe our product lineup is growing stronger every day and we keep investing to make it so because we believe in our potential. So across the corporation, I would characterize our markets as mixed, positive with significant potential yet turbulent from period-to-period. Now for the full year, sales worth $3.74 billion, an increase of 1.5% as reported and 0.5% organically, the critical industries overcoming shortfall in the vehicle OEM dealership arena and relative flatness over the year in the Tools Group. As reported OpCo margins for the year were -- was 19.4%, up 140 basis points. Excluding the onetime events, the OpCo margin percent as adjusted was 19.3% compared with an as adjusted 19.3% for last year, maintaining our profitability against the turbulence. As reported earnings per share for the year was $11.87, up 24.7%. And excluding the non-recurring events, the EPS was $11.81, up $1.69 or 16.7% compared to last year's as adjusted number. When we include the income from financial services of $230.1 million, which rose $12.6 million in the year, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation was 23.5% or an as adjusted -- or as adjusted 23.4%, up 20 basis points. That's the overview. Now, let's talk about the individual operating groups and their fourth quarter results. I'll start with C&I. Reported sales for the group including $400,000 of acquisition-related volume and $9.9 million of unfavorable currency grew $2 million or 6%. Organic sales increased $11.5 million or 3.5%. Robust performances in our Asia Pacific operation and our specialty torque division. I haven't talked about it very much before, but torque is getting bigger where particularly -- those two were particularly encouraging. Beyond that SNA Europe -- the SNA Europe operation and the industrial division both registered low single-digit growth with mixed results across the industries and the geographies. SNA Europe recorded single-digit increases in most of the core European markets that were partially offset by a double-digit decline in the U.K. overall growth despite the well-publicized uncertainty that's Brexit in this time period. Now, the Industrial division also showed variation across the business, up for aerospace and general industry, partially offset by some softness in natural resources in military, but overall showing a positive outlook. C&I operating income was about flat with 2017, $50.8 million, down about $500,000 from last year. Operating margin was 14.8%, down 20 basis points, reflecting the effect of the expansion in Asia Pacific. And Asia Pacific did expand more than offset -- it expanded more than offsetting the turbulence in China by gains in other key markets particularly India but also Thailand and Indonesia. Advances that were made possible only by customer connection and innovation. Two of our Snap-on Value Creation Processes is driving new products in markets like India, effective products like those in our Blue-Point hand tool offering. This year we added almost 300 new tools to the Blue-Point lineup and it helped drive those expanded sales on the subcontinent. Another success in India was the Asian Dragon Imaging Aligner ideal for tight spaces. It's a high-end imaging aligner and a compact package perfect for the really small footprints of the Indian repair shops and the customers in India they seem to agree. Also strong in C&I as I mentioned before is our specialty torque business. It's making encouraging strides, strong growth driven in part by widening array of new offerings developed by -- developed in combination with the SNA Europe and our specialty torque operations, products like our new powerful wireless torque control unit. That is -- that has been co-developed by SNA Europe and specialty torque. Demand -- there's a demand for efficiency and autonomy across the critical markets. And with that torque precision -- the torque precision is rising in importance and Snap-on combining our long-held experience in that field with the capability of our new torque acquisitions like Sturtevant Richmont and Norbar we're poised to take advantage. And you can see it in this new unit. The new torque control unit is a great example. It puts together Snap-on SNA Europe's industry-leading ergonomic design capabilities with Sturtevant Richmont's wireless capabilities. It also incorporates Sturtevant Richmont's unique DIN style rectangular connector accommodating a wide variety of interchangeable wrenches allowing to engage a broad array of customers like no other product in the aviation and natural resources and heavy duty and in general industry. It's another timely add to Snap-on SNA Europe's lineup and it clearly matches the industry trends, it's going to be a big seller. Now let's talk about the Industrial division focused on critical industries, outside the vehicle garage gains now accomplished for nine straight quarters. And that trend's been driven by customer connection extending our understanding of critical work. That progress -- the progress of understanding the work can be measured in the number of new tool solutions we offer each year. Well just last year we added over 5,000 new products to our critical industry lineup. That's quite a few. So I think you can say with -- we say with confidence, we're rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage extending to critical industries with greater strength than ever before. Critical industries is a favorable market environment and we're amplifying that opportunity with innovative new products aimed at solving the task of -- consequence that inhabit that space. And the result is encouraging. Now let's talk about the Tools Group. Organic sales about flat, up 0.4%, but continued growth in the U.S. operations up low single-digits, a positive that was again offset by a decline in the international operations including the U.K. Operating income in the quarter was $57 million comparing with $67.3 million in 2017. The OI margin was 14.0%, a 240 basis point decrease. You can see that in the recent swing to unfavorable currency transactions from a positive position in the prior quarter and product mix and an increased spending to strengthen franchisee support. Those were all the drivers of that margin. In the quarter and throughout the year, however, the Tools Group did confirm the strength and the market-leading position of our van network. And that's evident so clearly in the recent financials, but it was somewhat visible in the franchisee sales gain of the vans in the quarter and it was clear in the franchisee health metrics. Those health metrics is monitored each quarter. The franchisees and the networks are strong and the position -- and that positivity was once again acknowledged by multiple publications all listing Snap-on as a franchise of choice. This quarter we were once again ranked among the top franchise organizations both in the U.S. and abroad. We were again recognized by Franchise Business Review, which is the latest ranking for -- which in it's latest ranking for our franchisee satisfaction listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise making the 12th -- marking the 12th consecutive year we received that award. We were also ranked number one among all franchisees in Entrepreneur magazine's 2018 List of Top Franchises for Veterans. And abroad Snap-on was ranked number four in the Elite Franchise Magazine's top U.K. franchises for 2018. So this is -- finishing above a number of prominent international and U.K.-only franchises. Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and of our van business in general and it wouldn't have been achieved without continuously investing in a continuous stream of innovative new products. And in 2018, we \u2013 once again the Tools Group increased, the number of hit products those million-dollar sellers developed from a direct observation gained in the field. One is our Flex-Head ratcheting wrench. We just launched a full complement of these powerful problem-solvers, the ratcheting wrenches. And we've been expanding our new line continuously and the Flex-Head is the latest addition. The flexibility of the head makes it possible to access fasteners in very difficult locations alternator brackets, motor mounts, serpentine belts and suspension bolts. And we put that \u2013 the new Flex-Head together with Snap-on's durable gearing extraordinary length and low profile. It all combines for industry-leading strength, power and accessibility. It's another hit product and it makes the line of Snap-on ratcheting wrenches even stronger, even more versatile. And believe me we've been working hard to strengthen our tool storage line-up migrating some of the premium options like power drawer and speed organizers into to mid-range, equipping our heavy-duty shops with some of the advanced options like AC outlets and USB ports and introducing our KMP1422, the mid-tier with high capacity and small footprint. And this past quarter, we introduced our new flip color schemes creating boxes that shift colors under different conditions and viewing angles, three different patterns with three distinct color shifts burgundy to bronze, blue to purple to orange and gray to blue to gold. They're brand new, but they're catching attention and selling well. The Tools Group maybe below the growth trend, but we keep investing. We keep building its strength with new product and network vitality and it's starting to bring the U.S. channel back into its growth trajectory. Well that's the Tools Group. Now, let's move to RS&I. Volume in the fourth quarter was $339.9 million down organically 3.5%, primarily because of high single-digit decreases in our businesses focused on vehicle OEMs and their dealerships. A turbulent \u2013 it's a turbulent period in that lumpy project-driven sector. RS&I operating earnings of $87.4 million decreased $2.8 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency. OI margin was strong 25.7% up 40 basis points from last year with growth in innovative software and information products driving that progress. Along those lines, our Mitchell1 division providing software to independent shops, continues to pursue customer connection and innovation bringing great new products to improve shop efficiency. An example \u2013 as an example, we just added our ADAS Quick Link to the Mitchell lineup. The new Advanced Driver Assistant System or ADAS helps technician diagnose repair and calibrate a variety of driver-assist functions making the required repair information component locations, wiring diagrams, repair procedures and recalibration processes all available with ease with incredible ease and it offers data. It offers data on products for all OEM brands. So it creates that data at the fingertips for the technicians for all the OEM brands. Our ADAS Quick Link is unique in the industry and it clearly drives shop and technician's productivity. It makes the repair of lane departure warnings adaptive cruise control and other driver assist \u2013 other driver assist much easier. It's already received and it's \u2013 and it will be quite popular in the days ahead. Another example of how Snap-on Value Creation is authoring that continuous trend at Mitchell1. We keep driving to expand RS&I's position with repair shop owners and managers offering more new products to sell developed by the value -- our Value Creation Processes or added by our strategic and coherent acquisitions. And we're confident that it's a winning formula. Well that's our quarter. OpCo organic sales decreased 0.6% about flat to last year. Significant positives in the critical space that is C&I, favorable trends in the Industrial business, gains in India, Thailand and Indonesia overcoming the China turbulence and the ongoing return of the U.S. van channel to growth. The impacts of near uncertainty transition to lower auto sales and a turbulence of Brexit about offset by those positive gains. OI margin as adjusted 18.7%, down 70 basis points, still strong, but impacted by the shortfall in the van channel, the unfavorable flip in the currencies and the spending strengthening our U.S. van channel and overall as-adjusted EPS of $3.03, up 12.6%. That's our quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $952.5 million in the quarter were down 2.3%, reflecting a 0.6% organic sales decline $0.4 million of acquisition-related sales and $17.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease this quarter principally reflected low single-digit declines in sales to repair shop owners and managers in the Repair Systems and Information segment largely offset by a low single-digit growth in the Commercial & Industrial segment. Sales in the Snap-on Tools segment were essentially flat, but reflected low single-digit gains in the U.S. franchise operations. Consolidated gross margin of 48% grew 20 basis points, primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives, partially offset by higher material and other cost. The operating expense margin of 28.9% reflected 40 basis points of benefit from the $4.3 million legal settlement Nick referred to earlier. This compares to an operating expense margin of 31.6% last year, which included 320 basis points of negative effect associated with the $30.9 million legal charge incurred during Q4 of 2017. Operating earnings before financial services of $182.1 million or 19.1% of sales compares to $158 million or 16.2% of sales in Q4 2017. Excluding the effects of the legal items in both years as-adjusted, operating margin before financial services of 18.7% compared to 19.4% last year. Financial services revenue of $82.7 million and operating earnings of $56.1 million, increased $2.8 million and $1.7 million respectively from 2017. Consolidated operating earnings of $238.2 million and 23% of revenues including $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $212.4 million or 20.1% of revenues a year ago. Excluding the effects of the legal items in both years as-adjusted, operating margin of 22.6% compared to 23.1% last year. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22% compared to 33% last year. Our Q4 2017 rate was reduced by 120 basis points as a result of the legal charge recorded in that period, but was increased by 360 basis points as a result of the $7 million charge related to the implementation of the new tax legislation in the U.S.. Excluding both the legal and tax charges, the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 as adjusted was 30.6%. Finally, net earnings on a reported basis of $175 million or $3.09 per share including a $0.06 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $129.5 million or $2.24 per share a year ago. Excluding $0.06 per share for the legal settlement, adjusted earnings per share were $3.03, up 12.6% compared to Q4, 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $2.69 which excluded the legal and tax charges last year. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I group on slide 7. Sales of $343.7 million in the quarter increased 0.6% reflecting a 3.5% organic sales gain and $0.4 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $9.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase included a double-digit gain in sales in both our Asia Pacific operations and specialty tools business, as well as low single-digit gains in our European-based hand tools business and in sales to customers in critical industries. Asia benefited from a strong sales performance in India and across Southeast Asia more than overcoming lower sales in China. Within the critical industries, continued strength in sales into the aerospace segment, as well as in general industry more than offset softer sales to the military and natural resources. Gross margin of 38.5% decreased 80 basis points primarily due to this higher sales volumes of lower gross margin products, principally in Asia Pacific as well as higher material and other costs, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 23.7% improved 60 basis points primarily as a result of sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.8 million decreased 1% and the operating margin of 14.8% decreased 20 basis points from 15% in 2017. Turning now to slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $407.4 million decreased 0.4% reflecting a 0.4% organic sales increase more than offset by $3.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales change includes a low single-digit increase in the U.S., partially offset by a low single-digit decline internationally. Gross margin of 40.2% decreased 120 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales of lower gross margin products as well as 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher material and other costs. The operating expense margin of 26.2% increased 120 basis points year-over-year primarily due to higher cost, including efforts to provide greater levels of; field, marketing and technical support for our franchisees. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $57 million decreased 15.3% and the operating margin of 14% compared to 16.4% in 2017. Turning to the RS&I group shown on slide 9. Sales of $339.9 million decreased 4.7% reflecting a 3.5% organic sales decline and $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The lower organic sales, reflects a high single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships and a low single-digit decrease in sales of under car equipment. Gross margin of 47.5% improved 210 basis points, primarily as a result of the shift in sales that included reduced volumes within our OEM facilitation programs, which typically feature lower gross margin products. Gross margin also benefited from RCI. The operating expense margin of 21.8% increased 170 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the effect of lower OEM facilitation sales volumes and higher other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $87.4 million, decreased 3.1% from prior year levels. However, the operating margin of 25.7% improved 40 basis points from last year. Now turning to slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $56.1 million on revenue of $82.7 million increased 3.1% and 3.5% respectively from a year ago. Fourth quarter financial services expenses of $26.6 million increased $1.1 million primarily to a -- due to a $500,000 year-over-year increase in provisions for losses on contract receivables and increases in other operating expenses. Total provision expense for finance receivables of $16 million in the fourth quarter was the same as in 2017. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.3% in both of the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017. The average yield on finance receivables in the fourth quarter was 17.7%, compared to 17.8% in 2017 driven principally by product mix and reflective of the credit quality of customers originating loans over the past several months. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% for both 2017 and 2018. Total loan originations of $267.1 million increased $2.1 million or 0.8% year-over-year due to higher originations of contract receivables principally franchise finance. While finance receivable originations were essentially flat we did see some sequential year-over-year improvement in the United States. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables including $1.8 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $16.8 million in the fourth quarter. As for the 60-day-plus delinquency trends, they are stable year-over-year and also reflect the seasonal increase we typically experience in Q4. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12-month net losses of $52.3 million represented 3.16% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 24 basis points year-over-year, but essentially flat sequentially again this quarter further supporting continued stabilization in the portfolio's credit metric performance. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $215.9 million in the quarter increased $22.4 million or 11.6% from comparable 2017 levels, primarily reflecting higher net earnings, partially offset by the settlement of the employment-related litigation matter. Net cash used by investing activities of $60.8 million, included net additions to finance receivables of $38.4 million and capital expenditures of $22.4 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $135.1 million, included cash dividends of $53.1 million and a repurchase of 630,000 shares of common stock for $99.7 million under our existing share repurchase programs. Full year 2018 share repurchases totaled 1.769 million shares for $284.1 million. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $215.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $17 million from 2017 year-end, including $20.8 million of unfavorable currency translation. Days sales outstanding of 67 days compared to 66 days of 2017 year-end. Inventories increased $35 million including $23.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency from 2017 year-end. As a reminder, the increase in inventory from 2017 year-end included $20.9 million related to the recognition of an inventory asset associated with the adoption of ASU Topic 606 on revenue recognition. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.9 compared to 3.2 at year-end 2017. Inventories decreased approximately $17 million from the end of the third quarter. Our year-end cash position of $140.9 million increased $48.9 million from 2017 year-end levels. Our net debt-to-capital ratio decreased to 24.5% from 27% at year-end 2017. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter-end we had $177.1 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2019. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate that our full year 2019 effective income tax rate will be comparable to our full year 2018 effective tax rate of 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on fourth quarter, near-term turbulence, the auto sales transition and the associated uncertainty and the effect of Brexit, all of that about to offset by C&I stable trajectory, continuing \u2013 the favorable trajectory of C&I, continuing to extend in critical industries, Asia Pacific progressing, overcoming China's turbulence, and the Tools U.S. recovery. We believe strongly in our opportunities for growth and improvement. That's why we're keeping increasing our customer connection, working on innovation and launching new products. Looking forward, we see attractive opportunity and we believe we have a strong position to take advantage, a position in products. And an optimistic and capable van network, and a growing penetration of critical industry, and a building array of unique repair databases, and an expanding capability in the broad markets of Asia Pacific, all serving as an effective base for moving forward, for offsetting turbulence and for achieving a positive trajectory through 2019 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates around the world. I know you more than anyone, see the turbulence today. And I know that we've been able to prevail because of your extraordinary capability, energy and dedication. For your role in our progress, you have my admiration. And for your unfailing commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle : Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the question. So I guess the first one. Good morning Nick, how are you. Nick Pinchuk : Fine. Curtis Nagle : Could you guys talk -- maybe speak just a little more specifically about why you guys are -- sounds like pretty confident that U.S. franchise business is on a trajectory of sustaining growth after a couple of years of fairly modest results on a revenue basis. Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Look I think this is the thing. I mean there are lots of goes-ins and goes-outs in this quarter as you can listen. But the thing is, if you look at our franchise business this is the second quarter of positivity, positive growth or returning to positive growth. And we think if you look at the sales of the van, they exceeded the numbers. Now over time, the sales of the van generally equal our numbers, but sales -- our sales of the van they're sales too. Our sales are the sales to the franchisees then they sell to end customers. The end customer sales are pretty strong this quarter and they started to approach where we want the tools business to be. So we were encouraged by that. It's one data point, but we're encouraged. And then we saw how we came out of 2018 towards the end of the year they were positive. So I think we feel good about that. More than that, when you talk to the franchisees, they're optimistic. I spent a lot of time talking to them. And I look at our product line. I think or product line is nonpareil and stronger and getting stronger every day and the franchisees agree. Curtis Nagle : Got it. And then just quickly shifting to RS&I, I don't know if you specifically commented on this, but how did the diagnostics business fare? And how are you looking at the next year? And when does the MODIS launch? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Well, first of all, couple of things. MODIS is an existing product. It's not a launch. It's sold very well in the quarter. The diagnostics business -- diagnostics sells primarily to the Tools Group. The Tools Group sales of diagnostics were up year-over-year. It was a less rich mix which is one of the product mix problems associated with Tools Group margins. But MODIS and SOLUS sold very well through in diagnostics. And in terms of the Tools Group, if you signal back to the RS&I business itself there is -- the sales to the Tools Group were less than last year, but that just has to do with the inventory adjustments between the Tools Group and RS&I. I would suggest that diagnostics had a pretty robust selling period in this quarter. If you look at Repair Systems and Information, we -- usually how we described that is the Repair Systems and Information sold to independent shops is fairly positive and they're good margin drivers for RS&I which is probably the reason why you see RS&I 25.7% up 40 basis points. Curtis Nagle : And then how are you thinking about this year? Nick Pinchuk : I feel I kind of like our product line when I see it coming out. I like the momentum in this year. So from quarter-to-quarter, you can -- one of the things you find as you follow us over time, you can't really hang yourself in any one quarter in terms of products as you break it down by product, but we like our diagnostic offering. They are better than anything in the market. And it's only getting stronger and providing more options for customers, for technicians. And no one can match them. And we have enhancements coming in the next year. Curtis Nagle : All right, thanks very much. Appreciate it. Nick Pinchuk : Good. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. Can you hear me? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, sure. Good morning. Christopher Glynn : Okay, great. So at C&I, the 3.5% organic was particularly striking on the comparison. You were up 10% last year. So that stood out. I'm just wondering if that equates as comparisons normalize to increased organic confidence and ability and visibility for C&I as you contemplate 2019? Nick Pinchuk : Actually 3.5% was nice. I mean, I think if you look at over five -- C&I is one of those businesses, which tends to be more variable in terms of the -- even though it's got positive trajectory, C&I has grown -- take a look at our Industrial business, it's grown over the last five quarters like at 7% -- 7% or 8% organically. But quarter-by-quarter it's been all over the map, mid-teens and some low single digits. Because of the calendarization of those orders. That was the basis of my comments. So we thought this quarter was nice. We had great order activity. We had -- we did well in aviation and other places, but -- in general industry, but we -- it wasn't as strong as some other quarters. So, this was a little bit of a flat period for C&I, still it was a good -- if you look at the overall trajectory it was very strong. Christopher Glynn : Okay. Yeah, I thought so given the confidence\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : So I guess another way to say that is we have expected -- positive expectations around C&I. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then for SOT between mix and investment, margins were down quite a bit there. I'm just wondering, how we think about the margin run rates currently that you experience for the full year 2018. Nick Pinchuk : We wouldn't want think something we \u2013 sorry, sorry go ahead. Sorry. Christopher Glynn : Yeah, and just if there are any sustained headwinds if we should expect little continued pressure there? Nick Pinchuk : The currency is going to be -- the currency flipped on us. They had 40 basis points of good news last quarter in the currency. That flipped to negative this quarter. So, part of the problem -- I usually don't mention currency, but part of the problem is that flip you can't necessarily adjust in pricing and other things that quickly, and so it was an unusual flip for us. We usually don't see it that quick. We'll see continuing pressure, but we'll learn -- we'll deal with that in terms of market pricing and so on in RCI and so on. You're going to see some pressure on material cost and that eats up some of our RCI but we have RCI against those. The margin mix I think was more or less kind of a phenomenon that is hard to forecast, but this was a particularly low point of the quarter. Fundamentally, last year you were selling -- you were pounding ZEUSs into the marketplace. Diagnostics - our highest-priced diagnostic unit great margin. This time we were pounding the -- we're pushing the non-intelligent diagnostic portion of our lineup, the MODIS and the SOLUS, so those are lower margins that was pretty much what drove that. I wouldn't expect that continue -- to continue in that kind of level going forward. So I suppose that's a long way of explaining why we thought this was a lower point. Christopher Glynn : Got it. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from David MacGregor. David MacGregor : Nick, I guess just looking at the relatively flat Tool segment organic growth in both 3Q and 4Q I'm wondering why do you think the conversion of SFC orders was so disappointing. And I guess overall now what kind of order growth did you see from the 2019 regional kickoffs? And any reason to believe you'll see a maybe a better conversion rate on those orders than you did on the SFC orders? Nick Pinchuk : Look I think we have said [indiscernible] come home that you can't really get failed from the SFC. The SFC orders are up and they were up, that's an encouraging event. And part of it as I tell you the sales of the van had been pretty good. So, I kind of feel okay about that. I think if you look at the U.S., we feel -- even though the numbers aren't quite showing it yet, we see the U.S. making progress. The thing that has bedeviled the Tools group in these is the unlooked-for effect of Brexit on the U.K. and some softness internationally, but it really has offset any kind of gain we see in the U.S. And I think the U.S. gain is somewhat muted compared to what the franchisees are saying. So, I feel okay about that. I don't think -- I think the SFC kind of did its job. David MacGregor : And the regional kickoffs your thoughts there? Nick Pinchuk : Regional kickoffs the -- if you look at the orders that are currently coming out of the regional kickoffs into the first quarter, they looked pretty good. So, I feel okay about that. And, of course, there're always ups and downs when you go from region-to-region-to-region and from franchisee-to-franchisee, but I think, when we look at the effect -- and what we've tried to do is bring the effect in closer to those events as we did -- as you know we did in the SFC and that seems to have worked some in the regional kickoffs as well as the SFC. David MacGregor : And you got the lower inventory turns even adjusted for the $20 million year-over-year. I guess do you feel like you're over-inventoried right now in big ticket merchandise? Or just what's the makeup of the-- Nick Pinchuk : No, no. I wouldn't say were over-inventoried in big ticket merchandise. I would say that we're adding a lot of tools. We added 5,000 different line items for Industrial last year. So, we'll keep adding to tools. Now, you can say okay we are not getting all the sales we want. But if you look at the trajectory of our businesses, if you look at near-term maybe and get in a twist, but if you look at the trajectory of the Tools group over a five, six years, you'll see that it's more than 5%. If you look at the trajectory of C&I, it's a little bit below where we wanted to be. Look at RS&I, it is where we want it to be. So, you get those trajectories. I don't think while we're working on the quarter-to-quarter, we think we see the long-term good and we -- and adding the number of products is part of that strategy and we see it working overtime. David MacGregor : Okay. Just second question. You'd referenced the increase of $500,000 of provision for contract receivables. Can you -- what can you say right now about current trends and franchisee credit? And you called out franchisee health metrics. I guess what would you say as being the most bullish of the franchisee health metrics you-- Aldo Pagliari : David it's Aldo. The contract receivable provision largely reflects the leased equipment to garages. The franchisee health metrics have been steady and we experienced historically very, very low losses on the franchised portion of that. So, -- because you're coming off of a low base, it's just you can get noise one quarter to a next. And when the K comes out you guys get to see in about a week, but you'll see on a full year basis, the provision for contract receivables are actually lower on a full year basis. So, you just get some noise quarter-to-quarter, but in this quarter, most of the adjustment relates to leased equipment to garages. David MacGregor : Are you comfortable with current trends in franchisee credit? Are you seeing any inflections there that should be-- Aldo Pagliari : I certainly am comfortable. I'm certainly very comfortable. Nick Pinchuk : We are comfortable. David MacGregor : Yes. You're not seeing any inflections? Nick Pinchuk : No. We're not seeing any inflections. In fact, if anything I think it's getting better. So I mean, I don't know \u2013 yeah, sure. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird. Joe Vruwink : Good morning. This is Joe Vruwink for David. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, Joe. Joe Vruwink : I wanted to drill into Tools Group margin a bit more so I understand the dynamic with the diagnostic product category. Can you talk about the power tools growth in the quarter? And then was that subject to additional tariff pressures at all in the quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Power tools had some tariff pressure in the quarter, but its growth \u2013 it wasn't \u2013 I wouldn't call it a factor in the quarter power tools except that, power tools was one of the places that didn't grow in the quarter in the Tools Group. So power tools didn't have a particularly robust quarter. It had a pretty good quarter last quarter. So we kind of didn't read anything into that, but it didn't have particular growth. So it wasn't \u2013 if you're looking for the tariffs effect of that, I wouldn't call that a factor here. The factors are the ones I called out the flip. The \u2013 if you look at the currency around the pound and the Canadian dollar and so on where they went in the last quarter and particularly the end of the last quarter, you can see that motion. And so we just didn't \u2013 maybe we should have been better at it, but we didn't get our order quickly enough. And so that 40 to 20 basis point flip was a tough one on them and then they do spin. We want them to spin and by the way we think that's paying off when you see the sales of the van. And then, if you look at the margins, the product mix, it was a particularly weak product mix compared to the ZEUS in the last quarter. That's the way it played out. And so yes you're rightly pointing out that that was a \u2013 arithmetically that was a dominant number. Joe Vruwink : And then on the franchisee support initiatives, I understand, those are going on all the time, but they typically don't get called out in the quarterly deck. So was it a larger-than-normal investment in the quarter and if that's the case why now? Nick Pinchuk : That's somewhat larger but the thing is part of it is, is that we \u2013 remember I said that, I wouldn't say it's like what I would call a singularity in the quarter in this quarter. But remember, when you got \u2013 when you have your intelligent diagnostics and we have more of these, I would say more complex product offerings around the new hand tools around Flex-Head ratcheting, so around the FDX, the hand tools around Flank Drive Extra and around the intelligent diagnostic you got to spend \u2013 we made a conscious decision that we had to spend more time helping our franchisees communicate the value of those sort of marketplace. So that's been growing a little bit. And we see the payoffs though. I'm telling you we think we see the payoffs. I think the \u2013 I like the sales of the van this quarter. So I feel okay about that. Now if this is as you say arithmetically dominant you pointed out arithmetically dominating is that margin shortfall? But part of it is that, but also the margins the product mix is a big thing in that and the reversal on the currency. And then of course, you have some tariffs and some materials eating up some of our RCI. Joe Vruwink : But I think Snap-on has a pretty good track record of making these corporate investments when you see a growth opportunity. I'm thinking about the Rock 'N Roll Cabs and the Techno vans and some of the early cycle studying the franchisees and increasing their productivity. All of those investments ultimately drove inorganic growth improvement. Is what we're seeing this quarter calling out the investment in the technical skills that are with your franchisees are better positioned to sell diagnostics. Would you expect that drives an acceleration in diagnostic growth during 2019? Nick Pinchuk : I would expect it would drive a richening of our mix around software which it's doing and presumably a robust diagnostic sales, but also robust hand tools sales. And hand tools were nicely -- were nice in the quarter, so I feel positive about that. It's harder to -- it's harder -- it's not as easy as the Rock 'N Roll Cab because the Rock 'N Roll Cab was very palatable. Anyway, we're pretty positive about the quarter. If -- Joe, if the U.K. and the international businesses didn't find the problems associated with Brexit this would look a lot different I think. Joe Vruwink : And then my last question on RS&I, U.S. auto sales have been plateauing around $17 million for four years. So this is probably going to be the fifth year around that level. So it doesn't really seem like there's a major change in the end market outlook and yet you're getting feedback from your sales team that the OEM dynamic has changed. Is there something else going on? Nick Pinchuk : Well I don't know. No, I don't -- I think didn't IHS take down the market below $17 million ? Didn't Native take down the market below $17 million? So I think they forecasted down below $17 million. Didn't GM announce that they're closing a bunch of plants and therefore are drawing in their home. I think everybody's been kind of demuring on this market a lot of very public announcements. And I would suggest that that creates an aura. I'm not surprised at this at all. I think that creates an aura of uncertainty. I'm not saying that this is a long-term thing. I think this is a shorter-term thing. I think we're feeling pretty good about next year in terms of projects. I think eventually, it's like gas prices. When gas prices go up, everybody stops driving for a couple of weeks, so I think this is the same kind of thing. That's how I view it. Now I could be wrong about this and we could be wrong, but that's the way we see it. The OEM projects have been coming down and we see some opportunities next year. So we think the effect wears off, but I think the -- it's the concern and conservatism over what's going to happen in the future. Joe Vruwink : And then last question on the -- last question on this. So even though there might be some questions around overall industry volume there are more new vehicles launching in 2019 versus 2018 and that typically is good for your facilitation business. Would you expect that to contribute more in 2019 versus 2018 was a down year versus 2017? Does that come back for you? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. I think so. I mean, of course famous last words. You know what I mean? But, yes. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Good morning guys. Nick Pinchuk : Hi. Aldo Pagliari : Hi, Bret. Bret Jordan : I guess on the Tools Group margin again. I guess, I was thinking about that franchise support spend. And I guess, also you talked about lower margin mix. Was there anything I guess either accelerated rate of promotions this quarter year-over-year? Or maybe you could talk specifically about tool storage and whether your volumes were up year-over-year and sequentially in that base? Nick Pinchuk : Tool storage was okay. Tool storage volumes were up. I don't think there was anything particularly special about the promotions around tool storage. So I would suggest that there were special things around promotions around diagnostics. And I don't think -- we see these things from time to time. But remember, what we did was, we had been pushing the intelligent diagnostics, the software packages, the Apollo and the ZEUS, with the data packages for, what, three quarters? And so we've been pounding nose. And there are other customers who are a little bit less software receptive and want to look at the non-intelligent diagnostics, the non-enabled products that are MODIS and SOLUS. And so it came their time and so we pushed those. And generally, when you do that, you do put promotions around it to get franchisee attention and give customers a reason to buy. And that's what happened in this situation. And the comparison to last year, which was rolling out this new product, the ZEUS, the best thing since sliced bread and it is, it's a tough comparison. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then, I guess, one question on the OEM side. And this is sort of big picture, but do you see the OEM sort of pushing more towards an OE toolset in the sense that, I guess, the Fiat Chrysler is now encrypting the OBD port. They haven't activated it yet, but sort of trying to protect their software internally. And are they -- are the OEMs pushing their own as opposed to outside buys now as the bigger structural? Nick Pinchuk : I don't think that's a factor. I don't think that's a factor for us. It's always something we watch Bret, but I think for a dog's age, they wanted to take more of the repair back, but they haven't really been successful in doing that. I mean this is -- what you're talking about in Chrysler, is just the latest iteration of that effort I think. We watch it carefully, but I don't think it's an impact on what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about I think is more or less that fewer projects were done in the last couple of years -- in the last year and I think that had to do with the anticipation of uncertainty associated with this and the dealership themselves. I mean AutoNation talked about restructuring, I think, the other day. And they're talking about in U.K., they talked about 40% less investment in dealerships. And so, you have all that stuff rolling through the industry. I just think these guys are getting up every day and getting bad news for breakfast and they're pulling in their horns a little bit. After a while, they start saying, wait a minute, I don't have new car sales, but I better get some parts and service sales. Bret Jordan : Okay. So you don't see it, it's just lower spending, if not a reallocation of where they are spending? Nick Pinchuk : I don't think so. No we're not seeing that. Bret Jordan : All right. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time there are no further questions in the queue. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Sara Verbsky. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Both can be found on our Web site. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning everybody. As usual, well, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our quarter, and along the way I'll give you my perspective on our results, on our markets, on the progress we've made, and what we believe it all means. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. Once again the results for the quarter in the comparative periods include a number of special nonrecurring legal tax and debt events that affected our as-reported levels. So to provide greater clarity, we'll refer to amounts excluding the one-time effects as an as-adjusted number to make everything comparable. And when you look through all of it we believe it's clear that Snap-on did make recognizable progress, demonstrating again our ability to continue a trajectory of positive results, recovering in some important areas, while overcoming some significant challenges. We're encouraged by the quarter. The Tools Group U.S. van network, which has been the center of some considerable attention continue its improvement growing mid single digits on fairly broad improvement. Our side saw some rise in its business serving the vehicle OEMs that had been down for several quarters. And the corporation's efforts around Snap-on value creations are runways for improvement fought off the challenges of unfavorable currency and uncertain environments in some of our geographies to maintain and expand our profit margins. Now to the results, first quarter as reported sales were $921.7 million, down 1.5% including a $26.1 million or 290 basis point impact from unfavorable currency. Organic sales were up 1.4%, gains in the U.S. van channel and critical industries tempered by the turbulence. From an earnings perspective our OpCo operating income for the quarter, including the one-time benefit from a recent legal settlement and an offsetting impact of unfavorable currency, was $187.4 million, increasing 5.5% compared to last year. OI margin for the quarter was 20.3%, rising 130 basis points. On an as adjusted basis, excluding the nonrecurring items, the OI margin was 19.1% up 10 basis points. For Financial Services, operating income of $62.1 million was up compared to last year's $56.9 million. And the as reported OI margin including both financial services of OpCo was 24.8%, up 180 basis points. The as adjusted OI margin was 23.6% compared to the as adjusted 23% last year. And EPS on an as reported basis was $3.16, $0.34 or 12.1% above last year. The as adjusted EPS was $3.01, exceeding the comparable $2.79 from last year by $0.22, an apples-to-apples increase of 7.9%. Now, let's look at our markets. We believe the auto repair market remains a great place to be despite the variations. The ageing of the car part, the changing repair tasks as new vehicles introduce, the increasing vehicle complexity are solid underlying drivers that we continue to see across the segment. Now, we do see headwinds arise from time to time associated with macro difficulties in certain geographies like the U.K., and in certain sectors like the OEM dealerships when the new car industry sees turbulence. We are however convinced that the outlook is positive, and we keep investing, investing in product, in hardware and software and data and processes, all to further our advantages. You can see some of that confidence coming to fruition with the recovery in the U.S. van channel driven by great new products. And with the turn in the OEM business in RS&I we believe the auto repair industry is a great place to be, and we're confident regarding our current position and our future. In other opportunities, the market we've termed the critical industries, sectors like natural resources, the military, and aviation. We see our business growing stronger in that arena with new products and new customers. We also see period-to-period challenges, but overall we believe we're becoming more effective in those large vertical markets with stronger products like automatic tool control, sophisticated torque system, and task-targeted hand tools. And we're winning a growing array of committed customers. So, overall, I'd describe our markets as continuing to offer attractive opportunity. We've also enabled our Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection [ph], innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement, our RCI, processes along which we're committed to drive improvement. They support our advancement in positive times, and they create powerful offsets in turbulent times. We believe you can see that in our results over time, and you can see it in the first quarter. Snap-on value creation overcoming challenges, and continuing our performance progress.  Now, let's move to the groups. In the C&I group, organic sales were up $4.7 million or 1.5%, now including $13.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency first quarter as reported volume declined $9.1 million. From an earnings perspective C&I operating income was $46.5 million, about the same as last year. The operating margin was up 40 basis points to 14.4%. Organic volume, RCI, and the effect of foreign currency drove that rise. We've been speaking for some time about the importance of our torque product line, well robust performance in our specialty torque division was particularly encouraging, with a high single-digit increase this quarter. And beyond that, growth in the critical industries was evident in the quarter. Both those gains were partially occluded or partially attenuated by spotty performance in some of our international markets. Now, critical industries showed variations across the businesses. Up for natural resources, the military, education, and general industry, partially offset by some softness in aerospace, but overall showed a positive outlook. We're confident in and committed to extending in the critical industries, and we have seen continuing gain. Now 10 straight quarters of growth authored by a strengthening lineup of innovative product, matched to the task and designed specially to make work easier in the uniquely challenging industrial workspace, and our torque lineup is an example of that expanding strength. As a matter of fact, torque and critical industries are natural partners, and we've been investing to pursue the possibilities. A great example, just introduced, is Snap-on's ControlTech CTech Micro Torque Wrench fitted with Bluetooth Low Energy technology, BLE technology, and offering created by customer connection and innovation. Our traditional Snap-on specialty is torque in a compact body. And we combined that strength with our recent acquisition Sturtevant Richmont's expertise in wireless torque programming and documentation. It all came together to make critically work much easier, much more productive with this extraordinary product. The Sturtevant Richmont BLE system enables remote programming to match in order the varying torque values required to complete many essential tasks in aerospace, the military, or oil and gas. And the remote communication model that does that seamlessly packages inside the Micro Torque Wrench, the micro wrench body, making the wrench able to operate in almost any space, including around those very tight inline fasteners that are so common in aerospace solutions. The ability to program and the ability to program a rage of torque values in order, and the ease of access means that the Micro CTech BLE does the work of four to five mechanical present wrenches, a significant cost reduction and a clear gain in efficiency. And beyond that advantage, the BLE Micro documents the actual torque supply avoiding the need for multiple torque audits in critical applications, saving even more time. The BLE Micro ControlTech guided by customer connection with the aircraft industry, enabled by the capabilities across the Snap-on division has been received by excitement, and it demonstrates the way our product line is expanding to solve the most critical of tasks. C&I, driven forward with customer connection and innovation, and it is working. Now, on to the tools group Tools Group, organic sales up 2.9%, a mid single-digit increase in the U.S., a return to the target growth range. And as a partial offset, a low single-digit decline internationally in places like the U.K. The operating earnings, $67.2 million, down $1.7 million, including $3.1 million of unfavorable currency. That represents a margin rate of 16.4%, lower by 60 basis points, but driven mostly with 50 basis points of currency headwind, so the Tools Group, another quarter of expanding sales in the U.S. and sales advancement overall with solid operating margins. We believe our van network remains quite strong, and it's evident when we meet franchisees. As I did with a group of them just this last weekend at the U.S. Franchisee Advisory Council, or when I meet with them individually as I also did last week, once again they uniformly express confidence in the strength of the business, displayed excitement about our products, and declared optimism for their future trajectory. I tell you, you can't help but leave these encounters energized. It convinces us how strong these businesses are. The van network has seen some variation though, but we are quite confident of the opportunities, and the tools team continues to work with focus and urgency across its geographies to drive the upward trajectory with programs or promotions or with great new products. When we speak of products we turn to Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, creating new offerings, solving critical tasks, and we're doing just that in the Tools Group. For example, last year, we released an innovative new socket line, the Flank Drive Xtra, we call it the FDX. It improved churning power - it has improved churning power, better fastener engagement, and greater strength. It's a patented designed that grips the fastener further off the corner with the more angle socket wall for greater turning power. That's where it gets it greater turning power; twenty percent more in nominal situations, fifty percent more when applied to worn or damaged fastener; the real problematic difficulty in repair. It exceeds the power of already industry-leading standard sockets. We believe we already have by far the best range of hand tools. The FDX makes it better. And the technicians agree. Hand tool sales are up nicely, demonstrating our product strength and contributing to the tools group's rising trajectory. Now let's talk about another category, tool storage, also up in the quarter. Helped in part by our new heavy duty mobile workbench capable of supporting up to 2000 pounds; 1300 on the bench top and 700 on the lower shelf. The new bench has adjustable leg allowing technicians to adjust their workstation to match the work -- customize the work surface just how they like it from 30 inches to 40 inches high. It's ergonomic, healthy, and safe. It also includes several storage solutions; optional drawers in various configurations allowing the techs to store those very valuable tools, those jewels with security. And they have special side panels with 22 accessories, accommodating frequently used bulky or metal units. Snap-on heavy duty bench has strength, durability, friendly ergonomics, and flexibility all in one product. And it's well on its way to achieving a hit million dollar product status. And we believe it has much more of a runway. That's tools group, improving growth, continuing profitability underpinned by strong product. Now let's speak about our S&I. First quarter organic sales declined 0.05%, close to flat. Reflecting low-single digit increase in our Undercar equipment operation, partially offset by a low single digit growth on our businesses focused on OEM dealers. Our S&I operating earnings of %83.6 million decreased $2.2 million including $1.5 million from unfavorable currency. Operating margin was robust, 25.5%, flat despite the lower volume. Now the OEM facing businesses did advance a recovery after several quarters of downturn. We said that the pullback will be a temporary phenomenon. And in fact, it was. That area has now improved. Having said that, we continue to clearly see abundant runways for growth in our S&I group. And we are working to take advantage of those opportunities again with new products like our recently introduced school bus diagnostic kit. The school bus package provides the repair technician with a guide to standard preventive maintenance procedures and offers quick capabilities for analyzing vehicle performance problems with that special application. The new kit it features our NEXIQ pocket HD heavy duty handheld unit, unique diagnostic software and full array of cables and accessories. School bus repair is a clearly -- it's clearly a critical task, and our new kit makes that effort more effective and easier. Also in the first quarter, we entered the motorcycle diagnostic market with our new P1000 handheld. Based on customer connection, new system build and underserved need for an all makes all model motorcycle diagnostic solution based on our customer connection, we knew we would well received. And that's just what happened. We are confident in the strength of our S&I product line. And that possibility is not just from our internal views or internal measures. Recently, we were acknowledges by Undercar Digest magazine with that publications naming four of our new products to its 2019 list of the top 10 tools; two Mitchell 1 repair products. Our ProDemand repair information system and our Manager SE Shop Management suite were selected. And two diagnostic products, our groundbreaking Apollo handheld with intelligent diagnostics and our Thermal Imager Elite were also recognized in the top 10; four in the top 10. The Undercar Digest awards are selected by readers, shop owners, and technicians. People who earn their living by being accurate and efficient when diagnosing and repairing today's vehicles. It's clear that these awards are independent verification of Snap-on's ongoing commitment to customer connection and innovation, but most of all to the extraordinary results of that focus. We keep driving to expand our S&I's position with repair shop owners and managers making work easier with great new product, developed internally with Snap-on value creation, or added by our strategic and coherent acquisitions. And we're confident it's a winning approach. So those are the highlights of our quarter continued progress, sales growth, and profitability gains, overcoming headwinds, RS&I group challenged but seeing some recovery in the OEM facing business, strength in the U.S. van channel and further progress in the critical industry. Snap-on Value Creation driving a wide array of new products, broad array of new products, as I've demonstrated here, and improve processes more than offsetting the turbulence or offering more than offsetting turbulence. Offering an as adjusted 19.1% optical operating margin up 10 basis points and driving an as adjusted $3.1 EPS up 7.9%, it was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results as summarized on slide six. Net sales of $921.7 million in the quarter were down 1.5%, reflecting a 1.4% organic sales gain and $26.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Your organic sales gain this quarter principally reflected mid-single digit growth in the U.S. franchise operations of the Snap-on tools group, and low single-digit growth in the commercial and industrial segment. Consolidated gross margin of 51.2% improved 80 basis points, primarily due to the higher organic sales, savings from our CI initiatives and 10 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses of $284.2 million benefited from the $11.6 million legal settlement Nick mentioned earlier. The operating expense margin of 30.9% improved 50 basis points as the 120 basis points benefit from the legal settlement was partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects in higher cost. Operating earnings before financial services of $187.4 million or 20.3% of sales included $5.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, and the benefit of $11.6 million from the legal settlement, excluding the legal settlement, operating earnings before financial services as adjusted was $175.8 million or 19.1% of sales, compared to $177.7 million or 19.0% of sales last year. Financial Services revenue of $85.6 million and operating earnings of $62.1 million increased 3.1% and 9.1% respectively from 2018. Reflecting continued growth in our financial services portfolio, as well as improved bad debt in delinquency of our performance. Consolidated operating earnings of $249.5 million are 24.8% of revenues included $6.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and the legal settlement. Excluding the legal settlement, operating earnings as adjusted was $237.9 million or 23.6% of revenues compared to $234.6 million or 23% of revenues a year ago. Our first quarter effective income tax rate is 24.3%, including an increase of 10 basis points related to the legal settlement compared to 26.2% last year. Our Q1 2018 rate included 120 basis points related to the implementation of tax legislation in the United States, excluding the tax charge, the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 as adjusted was 25.0%. Finally, net earnings on a reported basis of $177.9 million or $3.16 cents per share, including an $8.00 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $163.0 million or $2.82 per share a year ago. Excluding $0.15 per share for the legal settlements, adjusted earnings per share was $3.1 up 7.9% compared to Q1 2018; adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, which excluded net debt items and tax charges last year. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on slide seven, sales of $322.5 million in the quarter decrease to 2.7% reflecting a 1.5% organic sales gain more than offset by $13.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Your organic growth included a high single-digit increase in sales in our specialty tools business, as well as low single-digit gains with customers and critical industries. These increases were partially upset by a low single-digit decline in the segment the Asia Pacific operations, as well as lower sales in some of C&Is, Latin American markets, such as Mexico, Argentina, and Chile. Gross Margin of 40.4% improved a 140-basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the higher organic sales volumes, savings from RCI initiatives and 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 26% increased 100 basis points primarily due to 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency, and higher sales related spending and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $46.5 million were unchanged from last year while the operating margin of 14.4% increased 40 basis points from 14% in 2018. Turning now to slide eight, sales on the Snap-on tools group of $410.2 million increased 1.4% reflecting a 2.9% organic sales increase partially offset by $6.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Your organic sales gain includes a mid-single digit increase in the United States, partially offset by a low single-digit decline internationally. The sales increase in the U.S. reflected stronger sales of hand tools, tools storage and diagnostic products. Gross Margin of 44.6% included 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects remained unchanged from last year. The operating expense margins of 28.2% increased from 27.6% last year, primarily due to 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and higher other costs. Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $67.2 million included $3.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects decreased $1.7 million from last year, while the operating margin of 16.4% including 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 17% in 2018. So, into the RS&I group shown on slide nine, sales of $327.9 million decreased 2.7% reflecting a 0.5% organic sales decline, and $7.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The lower organic sales reflect a low single-digit decline in sales of Undercar equipment, partially offset by a low single-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships. Weakness in Europe impacted RS&I's overall sales growth in the quarter. Gross margin of 48.2% increased 10 basis points from 48.1% last year, the operating expense margin of 22.7% compared to 22.6% a year ago. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $83.6 million decreased $2.2 million from prior year levels, while the operating margin of 25.5% was unchanged from last year. Now turning to slide 10, operating earnings from financial services of $62.1 million in revenue of $85.6 million increased 9.1% and 3.1% respectively from a year ago. Financial Services expenses of $23.5 million decreased $2.6 million dollars primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses. As a percentage of the average portfolio financial services expenses were 1.1% in the first quarter of 2019 at 1.3% in the first quarter of 2018. The average yield on finance receivables in the first quarter was 17.8% for both 2019 and 2018. Respective average yield and contract receivables was 9.1% and 9.2%. Total loan originations of $252.5 million increased $5.2 million or 2.1%, primarily due to a 2.4% increase in the originations of finance receivables. Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables including $1.8 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $4.1 million in the first quarter. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for U.S. extended credit, improve 10 basis points year-over-year and also reflects the seasonal improvement we typically experience in the first quarter as it relates to extend credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12-month losses of $51.4 million represented 3.09% of outstandings at quarter end, that's down 7 basis points sequentially, supporting continued stabilization of the portfolio's credit metric performance. Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $201.3 million in the quarter decreased $30.6 million from comparable 2018 levels primarily reflecting net changes in operating assets and liabilities including the $11.6 million reduction in liability related to the quarter's legal settlement partially offset by higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $38.7 million included net additions to finance receivables of $18.6 million and capital expenditures of $20.2 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $147.6 million included cash dividends of $52.8 million and the REIT repurchase of 295,000 shares of common stock for $47.4 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of the end of March, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $476.9 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable decreased $17.3 million from 2018 year-end including $1.6 million of favorable currency translation. Days sales outstanding of 65 days compared to 67 days at 2018 year-end. Inventories increased $33.2 million including $1.5 million of favorable foreign currency from 2018 year-end. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.9 times at year-end 2018. At quarter end, cash position of $156.4 million increased $15.5 million from 2018 yearend levels. Our net debt to capital ratio decreased to 22.6% from 24.2% at year-end 2018. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities as of quarter end we had $131.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, a reduction of $45.6 million since year-end 2018. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts, Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Let me sum up, the step on first quarter. Step forward, advancements in several important sectors. The continuing strength of snap on value creation overcoming the challenges and driving improvements in overall earnings and in margins, we continue to be confident in the vehicle repair market, growth in the technician base, the aging of the car parts, the ongoing changes from model to model, the increasing complexity of repair, the rising need for diagnostic aids and greater repair data. These are continuing and favorable trends that offer substantial opportunity. And we believe we're best positioned to take advantage. We saw some confirmation of those possibilities play out in the quarter. Significant progress in the U.S. Van channel up by mid single digits returned to its target range and recording its third straight positive quarter and our vehicle OEM businesses return to growth after three down quarters. Of course there were challenges in the quarter that did partially mask the progress. Unfavorable currency, the largest impact we've seen for some time spotty markets driven by the macro environment in places like the U.K., France, Mexico and other parts of Latin America. But despite those challenges, we prevail the snap on value creation process is driving attractive and profitable new products and authoring a range of process improvements that overcame the difficulties and authored OI margin of 19.1%, up 10 basis points and an adjusted EPS of $3.01 up $0.22 or 7.9% despite the challenge. It was an encouraging quarter which we believe points to abundant opportunities and confirms that snap on has the position, the capabilities, the products, the markets and the markets to continue our positive trend through the rest of 2018 and beyond, 2019 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Our first quarter results, our positive trends of performance and our significant opportunities going forward would not be possible without your extraordinary contribution for your success in driving our progress. You have my congratulations and for your continuing dedication to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hi, good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Gary. Gary Prestopino : How are you? Good, good. A couple of questions just real quickly, Aldo, that benefit on the patent litigation that has -- that was a U.S.-based issues, there's no FX impact that either way, right? Aldo Pagliari : That's correct, Gary. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Then, hey, Nick, could you maybe, in terms of the tool storage, and I'm not looking for an exact number, but did you see both a year-over-year and sequential increase in tool storage product sales in the quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, well year-over-year was up. I think the first quarter is always a little weaker than the fourth quarter on most situations. So I don't think it's a comparable thing. We were pretty encouraged by it though. But I think more than that I'm encouraged by hearing the way franchisees are reacting to our product. I spent a whole day with our National Franchisee Advisory Council over the weekend and they couldn't say enough about it. With some of our new colors and wraps and so on, and some of the new products, that bench, we launched the 1422. We started out calling it the AN, but - the IQON, but that had to do with a special surface. And this takes advantage of that, only it's kind of a much more versatile thing. And that's just an example of the kind of cool things that our guys are bringing out, and they're driving tool storage volume. Now of course, again you have to keep earning their confidence and earning their excitement, but we feel pretty good. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then you said the dealership business bounced back and you feel pretty good about it. That tends to be lumpy. I mean what gives you the confidence and the visibility there, at least for 2019? Nick Pinchuk : You know, I'm seeing new products and new technologies roll out and I think this is just me talking in terms of my opinion, but I think having worked in the auto industry, what happens is when they behold, an auto industry it turns down like a needle [ph]. And I think IHI predicted downturns in the new car sales. They tend to think about it for a little while. I think they tend to understand -- try to understand where they're going to put their money. And so from time to time it does put a freeze on our projects, not to mention they match technology and so on. And I think after a while they realize how lucrative the aftermarket is with parts and services, so they start investing again. And I think that's what we're seeing. Plus we're seeing programs come out. We can see the programs rise. So, we feel okay about that, although we don't give guidance or anything, but I feel kind of positive. And we said it was going the come back. Gary Prestopino : Okay, and then lastly -- given the technological complexity of vehicles and all, I mean are you kind of looking at your business, again I don't want specific numbers, but do you guys look at it as a mandate of that, if we got 70 new products out that hit the one million sales mark in 2018, the goal is to increase that every year, every year, every year? Nick Pinchuk : Well, you know, yes. But I don't like the -- I haven't given out the number because I don't want to nail myself to the cross of that thing. In other words, I don't want to be reporting on it, but generally we want to launch more of those, and we have. In fact I'll give you the -- and note that last year, I think we launched six or seven times more new products than -- about six-and-a-half times, or six to seven times more new products than we had launched in 2006, so about 10 or 11 years ago, so there's been quite -- new hit products, million-dollar products. So, we have been driving it upwards, and it's kind of one of our metrics that we follow here, although if it went down one year I wouldn't be slitting my wrists or anything or really wringing my hands. But on the other hand, we like to see it goes upward. And we also are expanding our product line, not million-dollar products, but the products that address different customers in critical industries. So last year, we introduced 5,242 new products in that area just because we have a whole range of those vertical industries, and we want to adapt to particular demands, particular applications. So that's what's driving our business, new product. And the range of it is what I try to say or try to give a feeling for in my presentation. Gary Prestopino : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Bret Jordan : Could you talk a little bit more about the diagnostics products through the tool vans, I mean maybe give us some -- I think you mentioned Apollo being particularly strong, but maybe give us an update as to where Zeus is. And then my follow-up question for Aldo -- sorry, go ahead. Nick Pinchuk : Okay, no, go ahead. Bret Jordan : And I guess the follow-up question is for Aldo really on a housekeeping, just corporate expense, how should we be thinking about that and on sort of an annual run rate. The last year or so we've had some puts and takes as far as legal income or loss. I guess what do we think about core corporate expense spending level. Aldo Pagliari : I'll answer that one first, I'll let Nick dive into diagnostics. Corporate expense clearly benefited mostly this quarter by the $11.6 million reduction in our liability under the legal matter. But also it benefited in the quarter from about $1.6 million to $2 million or so of pension related expenses, which now fall below the line of the new accounting standard. So pension expense should continue on moving forward, however in the middle of the year you'd typically get the true-up of your census data, find out how long people are living, things of that nature. So, long answer to your question, Bret. I'd still say it's in the $90 million range, $92 million range on an annual basis. And again, you can get puts or takes on that depending on what level of spending might be around due diligence if you're looking at acquisitions or what the actual healthcare cost to the company come in at, that's what creates some noise around the fringes. Bret Jordan : Okay, perfect. Nick Pinchuk : Okay, all right. Look, in diagnostics. The diagnostics was up in the Tools Group, fairly -- the Tools Group was kind of a good quarter we thought. I mean you would say it was a good quarter, but was kind of broad advancement, so diagnostics was up positively. The P1000 was the -- the motorcycle diagnostics was a good one, but others sold reasonably well. I didn't say the Apollo was up gangbusters or anything like that, I just referred to Apollo as recognized by Undercar Digest. So, I don't really want to get into what sold and what didn't sell, because you can drive yourself crazy trying to analyze the ups and downs of different diagnostics in the quarter, different diagnostic sales or any different product line in the quarter. We find that not to be a very productive exercise because it depends generally on what people have on the van and how we promote them and how they're focused on selling and what captures their attention. And that changes from quarter to quarter. But I think it's fair to say that it was a fairly robust -- I think I can say fairly robust quarter in diagnostics in Tools Group. Bret Jordan : Okay, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning, everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Morning. David MacGregor : Good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. David MacGregor : Could you start off by just talking, Nick, about the regional kickoffs and how did orders compare year-over-year? Nick Pinchuk : I think orders were about -- I guess it varied from place to place. There was quite a bit of variation this year from place to place. I think it wasn't anything special I would say. But we've learned -- David, what we've learned about this is that I think as you -- I don't if we've learned it, we've known it all along, I think we've kind of tried to articulate this. Whether you're talking about SFC or whether you talk about the kickoffs, they are only one component of the forward action. The biggest thing that happens in the kickoffs, of course, having more orders is better than -- having more orders than - really robust order is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, but it doesn't deliver the quarter. And so we had a good kickoff season, but I wouldn't call it really gangbusters. On the other hand the follow-ons were very strong as well. So I think it's useful to look at it, but it isn't definitive even for the immediate quarter. We felt good about it. I particularly felt good about the training that occurred and some of the coaching that occurred in those situations, because our product line is only getting more complicated. It's more powerful, and it's generating great margins, as you can see in our product lines. David MacGregor : How would you say promotional activity kickoffs compared year-over-year? Nick Pinchuk : I think about the same. One of the great things I heard -- I read a lot of things. One of the great things, I was with the franchisees this weekend, like I said, last week. And one of the great things, music to my ears, they said \"You've given us the best values we ever had.\" That's what I want them to say. By the way, our margins overall for the corporation, 51.2%, gross margins I'm talking about. I don't like to talk about gross margins, but in this instance I will. 51.2% against currency was the highest in 20 years. The Tools Group - the Tools Group -- around the highest in 20 years, but the thing is very good. And the Tools Group was very robust, and it against 40 basis points of currency. So I love people saying you gave us great value. And by the way, that great value translated into good margins for us. David MacGregor : Right. Well, Nick, maybe my next question, you could open the Tools Group gross margins up for a little bit, like you did last quarter. And I think last quarter you talked about -- it was negative back ships, raw material issues, there was some negative FX from RCI. Could you just open that up? It was a little bit stronger than we expected, and I'd love to understand the puts and takes\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : New products. New product drives a lot of that. That's one of the things. And our guys' programs are very creative, and they impel selling, and they attract franchisees even if it's not new product, so that's part of the magic of the magician doing it. But coming back to your question, we had about, I think, in gross margin we had about 40 basis points of bad news in currency. And then there we had a slug. I don't want to really get into material costs and tariffs and all that stuff, there's a lot of turbulence. And we're not as vulnerable as a lot of people, but we have impact. Everybody else knows what's happened with material costs, it's going up. We usually -- we offset them. So in this quarter, the Tools gross margin is a great example. Look, you got currency. You got turbulence in the supply chain. You have some impact in tariffs, which we worked through. And yes, we've kept it flat. We had all of those running through our overall P&L and she shook them off, plus big currency. So I'm pretty happy about Snap-on value creation this quarter. David MacGregor : Was there much change in the international gross margins? Nick Pinchuk : I think there was. I think in general, you know, as you might think, in the U.K. U.K. has been struggling a little bit, so we tend to want to try to get that started back on the train. And so anybody who is running a business like that that's in that kind of turbulence really tries to push around in terms of maybe making some concessions and so on. So I don't think the international gross margins were as robust as the U.S., for sure. And it reflects the idea that the sales were down. And that's what those guys do, that's what we ask them to do, get the train started again, and then we worry about getting our money after that train starts. David MacGregor : Thanks. Last question for me is just the originations, up 2.4%, I guess, on the finance receivables subset. Is it possible that -- you talked about the strength in storage and in diagnostics in the Tool segment, was it possible your ASPs were down? Units were up; ASPs were down or at least were muted? I'm trying to reconcile the 2% with kind of the commentary that\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : I'll let Aldo talk in a minute, but I got to say this. First of all, there isn't temporal connection between the originations in one quarter and the selling, of course because there's time differences and so on there's a lot of things that flow through this. So it's not a productive -- I don't think it's very easy, even by us, to be able to necessarily tie those two together very directly. You have to look over at March at time and look for -- because I guess the best way to say it is, for connection between sales of new products -- sales of product and originations a quarter isn't necessarily a significant time period. David MacGregor : Okay. Aldo Pagliari : I've got to agree with that, David. It's just a matter of timing more than anything else. So the other slight differences to make your modeling more difficult, you have to remember the EC originations will report that as not currency affected. So, you look at the currency variations, they create some noise as well. But mostly it's timing. David MacGregor : So what would the timing influence have been on that 2% number? Aldo Pagliari : Well, we'll wait and see. We'll see what Q2 has to portray. It depends what the franchisees do with selling off what they bought in Q1, doesn't it. David MacGregor : Yes. Okay, thanks, gentlemen. Nick Pinchuk : Sure, thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Christopher Glynn : So, just a question about C&I, it's always a little bit lumpy, you get strong quarters, some softer quarters. Just wondering if you see the backdrop to support the kind of mid single-digit performance you expect over the long-term in the ensuing periods. And in particular what might be moving around with the APAC in the critical industries? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, look, I think you could argue critical industries, this quarter we had a couple of -- we've gotten a couple of big government jobs, big defense systems that are military jobs that are good for us. The idea that government go and cross the T's and dotting the I's and getting all that stuff out we're confident we're going to have those, but they were delayed out of the quarter, and that that kind of was created at that attenuation of some significance for the C&I Group. And then, there's a few markets which give them some problems particularly and gave them some problems this time, they sell into Latin America. They had some problems and they had some weakness in those markets. Mexico tends to be a bigger market for them in this situation. And so, they had those kinds of difficulties if you talk about Asia-Pacific, China is very good news on China. China was particularly down, but India was really encouraging. So I think we're looking forward, we're starting to think that China and India are horns on the same boat where everybody starts to think that that China is the big Kahuna and everything will India is starting to come up for us. We're starting to get big shells work, we're making increases in leaps and bounds in that environment and we don't see it attenuating. So I'm reasonably encouraged. Now of course aren't probably going to kick myself for saying this, but C&I is one of the most international businesses and there are turbulences around the world. You don't have to look at Europe too hard to see Germany wondering what's happening to the industry there. You see the U.K. and so on. So, you see some ups and downs but C&I did okay in those markets, they had problems in the peripheral markets like Mexico and Latin America and in Middle East and so on. I don't think that's going to last. Christopher Glynn : Okay, thanks. And then I don't\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : I feel pretty, I just the reason it is that I feel pretty positive about are our products. For example, Asia-Pacific start to sell to people like Cormack with the ATC, the ATC start to become the tool storage Foreign Object Damage product of choice in Asia that takes off it's good for us. So I feel good about those things. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then for the SOT margins, some apparently nice mixed recovery from the fourth quarter you talked about new products in particular hitting and you had some discounting I think to end the year last year, so just wondered if we should expect the mixed dynamics and discounting to flop around a little bit or if the first quarter is really a lot more representative than fourth quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, look I think what happened in the fourth quarter was more like we wanted to focus on customers. I think what we said was in diagnostics we wanted to focus on customers that weren't that interested in software. So we energized around the last generation products the solace and the modest. And sold those and of course they were last generation, so they tended to be less margins and other things. We that would be what happened in the fourth quarter, we're pivoting away with that, away from that now and we're making some adjustments in our new generation product lines to appeal to people who are less enthusiastic about software and still we're able to sell it to them. So I don't think that's going to repeat itself although Murphy's Law being what it is, I don't think by intent that will repeat itself. I don't see us going there by intent. I feel pretty good about the tools March now. Currency is going to continue. I mean what we see is that currency was pretty big this quarter, I think $6.2 million, $0.08 we see if everything stays away it is now, we see next quarter's kind of the same thing starts to get better in the third quarter and it kind of flattens out to fourth quarter but we're going to see currency headwinds in the Tools group in particular in the quarter, so we won't get rid of that. That's the thing, but I still feel pretty good about the margins I think when I talk to our franchisees and I talk to their guys they seem confident there's a spring in their step. Christopher Glynn : Okay. So you did see the network's success in driving some incremental interest in the intelligent products for mass? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, I think what I'm saying is we're making we made adjustments around that and we're launching new products, we're going to launch new products as we go forward and we did see some improvements this quarter, the fourth quarter as I said was a specific activity that said, I think I said we found after several quarters of driving intelligent diagnostics with the big data package, we're leaving a certain customer segment behind. So we went after them in the fourth quarter, we're not going after them anymore because we thought we sold them. We added them. We got them in the fold back in the fold. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And for\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Not doing special this time. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And just a quick one on international, is that just kind of stable leaky or still getting hands around what's going on with the international franchise? Nick Pinchuk : Wow, our job is to fix things like that, okay. But so, you can get better, but it's still a headache. You mentioned U.K. to me and the Tools Group and I immediately get a migraine, but it is getting better Europe -- in the last few quarters have gotten better. So it hasn't been to Australia still problem, but some of them gotten better. So that particular business has gotten better still not as fast as the U.S. I do feel okay about it. So I think our people are taking action. And we're not just not sitting still we're acting on this. And so, I believe we're on an upward trajectory, the time concept of that structure. The slope of that trajectory is another question. Christopher Glynn : Thanks very much. Operator : We will take our next question from David Leiker with Baird. Joe Vruwink : Hi, this is Joe Vruwink for David. Nick Pinchuk : Hello, Joe. Joe Vruwink : I did that mid-single digit growth and U.S. Tools Group pretty well match rates of sellouts in the quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, it was -- I think, the sales of the bandwidth a little bit lower, but generally, when you look over, three, four or five quarters are about the same. What's going on a van is going off, so no big difference. Joe Vruwink : And when you think it, I think you said it's three straight quarters now have kind of a nice return to growth in the U.S. tools business. When you think about the driver behind that, obviously on these quarterly calls, so you talk a lot about new product and I think you've had some compelling new product in the last three quarters to drive it, how much of the return to mid-single digit would you squarely place on new product as opposed to maybe some other initiatives you might have tried out? Nick Pinchuk : I don't know. I mean, I think new product is a thing, which energizes the franchise it's a kind of thing, which gets people to get on the van. They buy the new product and they buy some other things as well. Now, of course, that is necessarily true, it's a $10,000 toolbox or something. But generally, if they're buying a let's say, in FDX instead of sockets with FDX, a Flank Drive Extra, you get them on the van, they end up leaving with something else usually. So I think there's that kind of thing. So I don't think we never really track how much of new product drives that. I do know, though that it's a robust portion because they drive good margins. Anytime we bring out a new project -- a new product, we get our value for them. And so, you see the Tools Group nice margin. That's why we liked the new product. And the cool thing about it is, despite what people might think is that generally the changing vehicle complexity is pretty strong. And the cool thing about this is I know that some people would say that technicians aren't growing quickly and you know they are growing like 1%. But everywhere I go, people say I can't feel the jobs I have. So we're seeing, I anticipate in the future, some influx of new technicians. That's why we're spending all it's time and schools. That's why we have 468 schools using Snap-on certified Snap-on certifications. And we're in 2500 schools because we're making those people that are going to eventually fill those slots, customers for life. So I feel okay about I think the Tools Group is pretty good. Now I would correct you on one thing. I did not say that it was robust growth for three quarters; I only said it was a growth for three quarters. So some of that growth was a little slimmer than the mid-single digits, let's say. But it's a positive to see them moving upwards, if there's a trajectory there, that if you're a guy like me, you're pretty encouraged. Joe Vruwink : Yes, and then just a return, since you brought up the mechanic and shortage we have in this country. One of the byproducts is if you are a mechanic, you're obviously getting very healthy earnings growth at the moment, a good wage growth. Nick Pinchuk : 4.4% ELS data. Joe Vruwink : So when you think about the improvements and the risk metrics of the asset book. Obviously, delinquencies moving around -- moving down, maybe switch back to the health of the mechanic customer. How much is not related to that however, and maybe more conscious actions by Snap-on in the last two years to maybe skewed the risk of the profile a bit differently than in that '15-'16 timeframe? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think there is both in there. It's hard for me to -- it's hard for me to parse between those. I mean you will be entitled to both of those ideas. Look, I think the thing is I mean people have talked about this. And I think somebody might reasonably ask me and say, well, is that the appropriate level of losses? Well, I think people have worry that those losses were going to go through the roof. I think not. It's certainly we have been sitting at and we have been dealing with that for a long time. And it has not gone through the roof. And by the way, the fact does anybody thinks the finance company isn't a good business? It is. And so, I do believe we feel pretty confident about the quality of those loans, and getting better is a combination possibly of both things, I think. Joe Vruwink : And then, one last question. For the international tools grew business to ultimately only be down low single digit, was that better than you expected entering this quarter given the threat of Brexit and maybe the chaos that creates? Aldo Pagliari : The guys who run those businesses are listening to this call. So, I am not going to say that I was happy with being them. That's all I will say about that. Joe Vruwink : Okay. Fair point. Thanks very much. Aldo Pagliari : Thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Curtis Nagle : Great. Thanks very much and so apology if I missed this point, but diagnostics within RS&I was at up or down. And then, do you guys have any new platforms launching ex motorcycle? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, look, diagnostics in the tools group was up. Diagnostics in the RS&I group can be split into two categories. One is sales for the tools group. And then it sells a variety of software and diagnostic-related software and handheld units outside the tools group outside the van distribution. So the sales through the tools group were up in the quarter for diagnostics. The sales outside of the software particularly in the U.K. that software that was down quite a bit in this quarter, so that the -- the net of that diagnostics inside RS&I was down some, but if you parse them, healthy to the tools group. Outside that channel, down primarily because it's software stuff that rolling -- software stuff that was rolling through Europe and it wasn't as strong. It wasn't strong. Now in terms of introductions, it's already been announced that we are bringing out -- I was told not to talk about this on the call, but since you asked we have already announced the introduction of something called the Triton which is the replacement sort of like the one level down from the ZEUS and above the Apollo. You might -- so that kind of business it's replacement for what we call the MODIS. And that's been launched just recently -- just in the second quarter. So, we didn't have any sales at all in the first quarter. And we are still kind of rolling it out. When you roll these things out, you don't necessarily roll them out nationally. So that has the kind of thing that's happening now. But, we are pretty -- I think talking to the franchises over the weekend who had some of -- whom had seen it and had the -- saw the presentation, they were pretty positive about it. It's a $35 to $4000 product. Good product. And we think it will be a good seller. It adds the addition of scoping. So, it's aimed at mechanics who are working on projects that are high value and they can't afford to replace the component that they found is the problem. And has taken them three hours to remove, they can't afford to replace that problem. It takes three hours to remove and replace it and find out it wasn't bad. While the Triton different than the Apollo will allow you test that component before you take it out, and say is it good or bad. So it avoids big mistakes and makes it much more efficient in the garage for those people who are doing those kinds of activities. Curtis Nagle : Got it. It's very helpful. I appreciate it, Nick. And then I know it's a new category for you guys, but I guess it starts on potential to -- or how much you can grown motorcycle diagnostics? How big is that business? Nick Pinchuk : I don't know. We just we launched it in the first quarter with a good seller. We will see. I think we feel pretty good though. I mean there are a lot of motorcycles around. Lot of motorcycle shops, and this is the only all makes -- or pretty much all makes all models diagnostic. So it's as I said on the call, it's an underserved market. It was received enthusiasm. I feel positive about it. But to dimension it, it's a little early. We are not experiencing that thing yet. It is a good seller over in the quarter. Sure. Curtis Nagle : Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Operator : And we will take our final question from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial Partners. Ivan Feinseth : Thank you for taking my call and congratulations on another great quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you, Ivan. Aldo Pagliari : Thank you. Ivan Feinseth : My question is with all the great torque tools that you make, you really don't talk about opportunities in just general OEM manufacturing. I think there is so many areas of manufacturing for pumps, compressors, pretty much every bolt needs to torqued. Have you seen the opportunity? Nick Pinchuk : No, we actually have a category called general industry. I did mention general industry as being up in the critical industries area. And that's where we use torque. And you are very right. We would use -- we do use it in general industry quite a bit. They tend to be more one-off type of applications where the airplanes like I said there are lot of different situations where you can categorize them in bigger buckets. I think the general industry tends to be a little bit more customized. So, we tend not to mention in these calls, but it's a big category for us. You are very right. And so, we have a lot of opportunities there. And that's why we acquired Sturtevant Richmont. We acquired fast torque. We acquired Norbar to add to that capability of City of Industry, California. We will be coming -- we feel pretty good that in the industrial sector we may be the top torque business. We believe we may be the top torque business. And we are getting better because we are matching all our capabilities like talked about Sturtevant Richmont with their wireless capability together with a micro capability to compact capabilities of our City of Industry, our traditional strength putting together that BLEC tech micro. That's the kind of thing we are see in the future. And we believe that torque because everybody is looking for more positioning including the automotive industry, you know, by the time vehicles come precision is going to be really important because you don't want to be hitting the automatic part if you are not in precise calibration. Ivan Feinseth : Yes, I am excited -- I like acquisition you have made in the torque area and I think there is a huge growth opportunity there. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks. Ivan Feinseth : And I am also excited about new motorcycle diagnostic system, so I look forward to hearing\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Yes, that will be cool. Hopefully -- I can't believe we didn't do it earlier. So when I was saying\u2026 Ivan Feinseth : Yes, me too. Nick Pinchuk : There are so many opportunities at Snap-on for growth. Every time we do something like this, we say to ourselves what happened. How is it we didn't think of that earlier? So, -- okay. Ivan Feinseth : Congratulations and thanks again. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you very much. Aldo Pagliari : Thank you, guys. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Sara Verbsky for any additional or closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. And as always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our quarter. I'll speak about the general environments, the trends we see, some of the headwinds we've encountered, and I'll talk about our progress. Then Aldo will give you a more detailed review of the financials. We believe that our second quarter again demonstrates Snap-on's ability to continue with the trajectory of positive results, overcoming both ongoing headwinds and the period-to-period variations, the variations of the current environment. We are encouraged by the results. like every quarter, we had turbulence from geography to geography and from operation to operation. North American -- North America was positive, with clear growth in that region across our operations and our groups. In this quarter, that progress was attenuated by a slowdown in Europe and the U.K., but also in the other some important markets like Germany.  An example of that variation was evident in the Tools Group where overall organic sales were about flat. We had gains in the U.S. that were offset by organic decreases in international markets.  There was also a meaningful impact from currency in the quarter, translation and transactions, significant headwind. So there was variation. But once again, I think you can say our strengths prevailed. Now the results. Second quarter. As reported sales were $951.3 million flat, down 0.3%, but it included a $19.5 million or a 200 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency and an incremental $1.1 million from acquisition. On an organic basis, sales grew 1.6%. The opco OI was $189.9 million, declined $3.2 million, but more than accounted for by $5.9 million in negative foreign exchange. Opco OI percent for the quarter was 20%, down 20 basis points from last year, again due to negative currency, but still representing the second highest level recorded by the corporation in its current configuration.  For financial services, operating income grew to $60.6 million from last year's $57.8 million. That results combined with opco to raise our consolidated operating margin to 20.2 -- 24.2%, basically flat since 2018. EPS was $3.22, up $0.10. So those are the numbers. From an overall macro market perspective, we do believe the automotive repair arena remains favorable. For the Tools Group, the technicians, we did see headwinds in certain economically impacted geographies like the U.K. and Australia, but we also sought continued gains in the U.S. And as we look forward, we do see further opportunities for advancements as the vehicle techs encounter even more complex repairs.  The other side of auto repair, Repair Systems and Information, or the RS&I group, encouraging progress in the quarter, expanding our Snap-on's presence with repair shop owners and managers, capitalizing on a broader product line, a return to growth with the rise in the OEM programs. We like RS&I's potential moving forward. The repair shop is changing, upgrading. Both dealership and independent shops in RS&I is capitalizing on that trend with database solutions, great software products like our continually improving and gaining Mitchell 1 car and truck repair information software; powerful databases that are easy to use, helping the shop fix it right the first time and efficiently.  For the commercial industrial group, the other piece of our -- the other market we play in, or the C&I group, sales were up across a number of sectors and geography and the critical industry's significant growth in the military. And our specialty torque division, an ongoing upward trend, meeting the need, which we always said for increased precision authored by more automated systems and growing momentum in new markets in C&I in markets like India, which has become a real strong strength for us. So overall, the results remain favorable.  Tools Group. Continued improvement in the U.S., offset by headwinds in international markets, RS&I, resurgence in OEM dealerships and continued strength in repair information offerings and gains in multiple sectors and geographies across C&I. That progress outweighed the challenges, and results confirm it. And the strong operating income margin clearly demonstrated once again the leverage and the power of Snap-on Value Creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and Rapid Continuous Improvement. Snap-on Creation developing new products and solutions, borne out of insights and observations gathered at our customers' workplaces, which together with RCI, helped again drive the progress and overcame the current difficulties. That's the macro overview. Let's move to the segments.  In the C&I group, organic sales were up $6.2 million or 1.9%. Now including $10.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency and an additional $1.1 million of -- from our acquisitions, second quarter as reported volume declined $2.8 million. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $48.9 million, about the same as last year. Operating margin was 14.6%, 10 basis points better.  We've mentioned in April the pieces of this are these : that we mentioned in April the importance of torque in a world of increasing autonomous operation and precision. Well, that makes the positive performance of our specialty torque division, a high single-digit increase in volume in the quarter particularly encouraging.  Europe overall was challenged, but SNA Europe delivered yet another quarter of sales growth achieved in a difficult environment in critical industries, variation across the segments, but overall, it was up showing positive progress and a promising outlet -- outlook. We're confident and committed to extending in critical industries. 11 straight quarters of growth authored by our strengthening lineup of innovative new products matched to the test. Our military segment had a strong quarter, capturing significant long-term contracts and product breadth and strength; a positive difference. And as I said, our torque business has been marching upwards, becoming a clear success story. And our recent innovation played a big part in that. Innovation evident in great new products like the ATech FR125 electronic torque wrench, launched early -- it was launched early in the quarter. It's got an extended range up to 125-foot pound, and it's enabled with our new torque angle adjustment capability.  These days, automotive repair and maintenance procedures require a torque above 100-foot pound. And the new ATech 125 produced in our City of Industry California plant covers those expanded requirements. But beyond the torque capability, the unit has a stronger pivot point, utilizes our rugged dual 80 ratchet design. Combining both of those, the pivot point and the ratchet design, the 80 tooth ratchet design combining for more durability.  It also comes with our patent pending. This is a cool thing, Multi Axis Gyro Compensation system. So that automatically adjusts torque results when the ratchet head is angled. So it provides and produces significantly greater accuracy when making measurements. Accuracy, versatility, durability; all-in-one. Technicians all over are looking to replace multiple mechanical wrenches with a single ATech 125. Snap-on's already the leader in electronic torque, and the ATech 125 makes us stronger and that will become more important as we go forward. The first shipments were delivered in April, and sales have been robust.  Also in the last quarter, helping to mitigate some of the geographic turbulence, we launched a new window scale torque wrench in Europe, the Bahco 74W. It's aimed specifically at European -- or to the preferences of our European customers. It's produced by our recently acquired Norbar operation, and you know that's in the U.K., with the chemical resistance -- it's got its chemical resistant soft-touch handle using the well-regarded Bahco ergonomic design tools, makes for a really comfortable feel when you use the wrench. Each wrench also features a durable and accurate clicking mechanism that provides tactile and audible signals and is capable of standing 100,000 cycle, so it's quite durable.  Consistent with the present -- also consistent with the preferences of Europe's techs, settings on the 74W can be quickly adjusted using a built-in window showing a dual scale for Newton meters or foot pounds. It's quite different than what we use in the U.S. in terms of the way we see torque, affording greater clarity and ease when reading torque value. Sales of the overall European torque line have increased double digits since the launch. 74W is shaping up to be quite a success for us. Well, that's C&I, a promising quarter, moving the down the runways for growth and delivering profitability.  Now onto the Tools Group. Organic sales flat, down, I guess, 0.2%, reflecting a lower -- pretty much reflects lower sales in the international operations, predominantly in the U.K. and Australia, being partially offset by gains in the U.S. So pattern's similar to last quarter really. Operating earnings were $71.3 million, down $7.7 million, including $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency or a margin -- a wide margin of 17.6% compared to 19.2% from last year. That margin includes 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency and higher investment in field support activities, enabling the demand for our hand tools and underpinning the training for our Intelligent Diagnostics. So the Tools Group, another positive quarter in the U.S, balancing international turbulence.  We do believe our van network remains quite strong. In late June, I spent some time with dozens of franchisees at the NHRA Nationals in Chicago. They had a quite positive outlook on the position and on the prosperity. But beyond the windshield surveys like that, we see other indications of continuing strength like the franchisee health metrics, we -- those are the numbers we monitor and evaluate regularly. Again this quarter, they remained favorable. So qualitative and quantitative indicators, both positive. And the positivity is just not from our own internal lens. It's reflected in the external view. In fact, this year, we're once again be acknowledged by the -- by an outside publications. Snap-on was recognized as the #18 in Entrepreneurs Magazine Best of the Best for 2019, the annual Franchise 500 ranking. That evaluates companies for more than 150 data points in areas of costs and fees, size and growth, franchise support, brand, power, financial strength and organizational stability, among others. Our position in this year's ranking represents a substantial rise over last year. And once again, once again, we scored highest in the Tools Distribution category. In fact, we've held that top spot for some time. Now this type of recognition, I think reflects the fundamental and contemporary -- fundamental contemporary strength of our -- for our franchisees in our overall van business. And it would not have been achieved, we would not have the enthusiasm for the franchisees without -- with other franchisees without a continuous stream of unique new products, hand tools were up in the quarter, and it was driven by great new products like our F80MP multi-position ratchet. Features ahead, that index is in 16 positions across 240 degrees, a number of different much variability, giving it much better -- and that gives it much better access to fasteners around blind corners. And it's also a 2-in-1 unit that functions both as an offset fixed-head ratchet and as a speeder with a 360-degree crank for quickly tightening or loosening fasteners, it's quite versatile. Sales have been strong, and we already have plans for additional drive sizes, different handle grips and more colors is going to expand into a full line. Another product of impact was the Snap-on SRPCR series. It's a snap ring plier line launched this quarter showcasing a significant design improvement. Snap-on ring pliers are versatile units that can be used on both internal and external rings, switching from compression to expansion mode, accommodating a variety of repair and removal and assembly tasks. This new design allows the technician to execute that compression-to-expansion conversion up to 80% faster, utilizes a quick-release push button rather than the thumbscrew mechanism that's common on competitor products and is on our previous model. Pliers, they're manufactured on Milwaukee plant. So we can do this because of advanced forging -- called forging techniques and high alloy steel, creates the strength and durability require -- to require to enable that new design and support that speed.  Beyond the push buttons system, that unit also features extended jaws, making it easier to access hard-to-reach retaining rings. And to top it all off, it's got an ergonomic pushing for considerably more comfort and control. No wonder it's popular. Our new tools are, in fact, making a difference with the franchisees and in the Tools Group. Now on to RS&I. Sales of 348.8 -- $348.9 million, up $5 million, reflecting a $11.7 million or a 3.5 -- or a 3.5% organic gain, primarily due to return of the OEM dealerships, higher sales in the OEM dealership business, the essential tools business. Unfavorable foreign currency translation of $5.9 million was an offset, bringing the as reported rise to 1.7%.  Now RS&I operating earnings are $88.6 million in the quarter, including an offset of -- including an offset of $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared with $88.7 million in 2018. The operating margin was 25.4%, down 50 basis points from last year's pretty strong 25.9%. The variance primarily effects -- reflects that the higher sales of OEM essential programs, which boost as a sales but tend to have lower operating margins than the average RS&I activities, still good margins.  Having said that, we continue to clearly see abundant runways for growth in RS&I and working to take advantage. In addition to the new diagnostics and repair information offerings we have, we recently introduced a B2000 John Bean aligner that replaces the traditional workstation design with a more compact device utilizing an ordinary tablet and a new camera, a beam configuration, it's got considerable speed and ease-of-use and reported in a small overall footprint. It introduces imaging alignment to the compact segment of the market, and the reception has been pretty enthusiastic.  Also in the quarter, we introduced our new unique calibration array. We're really excited about this, new calibration array, for Advanced Driver Assistance System, so ADAS. One of the prominent trends in -- it uses ADAS as one of the prominent trends in later-model vehicles. It's developed by our diagnostics team and special target operators, each option recalibrating collision avoidance systems after body repair or as glass replacement or even a wheel alignment, for all makes and models of torque facing cameras, the ADAS calibration system -- our ADS calibration system was ideal for general repair locations and for collision stocks, enabling those independent facilities as of now finalizes the repair without having to visit the OEM dealerships. That's a great advantage when operating in a more complex world, in a more complex sensor-enabled later operating on more complex sensor-enabled later-model vehicles. It's very popular. It's going to be even more popular.  So to wrap up, RS&I, improving position for repair shop owners and managers, growth in OEM dealerships, driving organic sales gains, expanding product lines, margins down some, but still quite strong. Those are the highlights of the quarter.  Tools Group, mixed; U.S., up; international, down. C&I recording an overall positive performance especially in torque. And RS&I expanding, strengthened critical repair information and raising its OEM project activity. Progress along the runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways to improve. Overall sales increasing organically, 1.6%. Opco operating income margin, a strong 20%. The second highest level ever recorded by the corporation. EPS, $3.22, up again despite the headwinds. It was another encouraging quarter.  Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $951.3 million in the quarter were down 0.3%, reflecting a 1.6% organic sales gain, $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales and $19.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter principally reflected double-digit growth in sales to OEM dealerships and the repair systems and information segment and low single-digit growth in the Commercial & Industrial segment.  Sales in the Snap-on Tools segment were essentially flat, but included low single-digit gains in the U.S. franchise operations. Overall sales to customers in the United States increased across all segments while sales in Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, continue to exhibit weakness on a year-over-year basis. Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% compared to 51% last year. 120 basis point decrease primarily reflects increased sales in lower gross margin businesses, 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives.  The operating expense margin of 29.8% improved 100 basis points, primarily due to organic sales volume leverage, including higher volumes and lower expense businesses, lower performance-based compensation costs and RCI savings.  Operating earnings before financial services of $189.9 million, including $5.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $193.1 million last year. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.0%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 20.2% last year. Financial services revenue of $84.1 million and operating earnings of $60.6 million increased 2.6% and 4.8%, respectively, from 2018, reflecting a year-over-year growth in our financial services portfolio as well as lower provisions for credit losses.  Consolidated operating earnings of $250.5 million, including $6.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $250.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin was 24.2% in both periods.  Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.6% compared to 23.8% last year. During Q2 2018, our tax rate included a 20 basis point benefit related to the implementation of tax legislation in the United States. Finally, net earnings on a reported basis of $180.4 million or $3.22 per share included a $0.09 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $178.7 million or $3.12 per share a year ago. In Q2 2018, excluding a $0.01 per share benefit related to taxes, adjusted earnings per share was $3.11.  Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 11, sales of $335.0 million in the quarter decreased 0.8%, reflecting a 1.9% organic sales gain and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, which were more than offset by $10.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth included a high single-digit gain in our specialty tools business as well as the low single-digit increases in both the segment's European-based hand tools business and to customers in critical industries. Gross margin of 38.6% decreased 80 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and lower gross margin businesses, including higher sales for the U.S. Military and to customers in India. The operating expense margin of 24% improved 90 basis points, primarily due to benefits from organic sales volume leverage, including higher sales and lower expense businesses and from RCI savings. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $48.9 million compared to $49 million last year, and the operating margin of 14.6% increased 10 basis points from 14.5% in 2018.  Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $405.8 million decreased to 1.5% primarily due to $5.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic sales were essentially flat, reflecting headwinds in the United Kingdom and higher sales in the United States. The organic sales included a mid-single-digit decline internationally, nearly offset by a low single-digit increase in the United States. Gross margin of 45.1% decreased 80 basis points from last year, primarily due to 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 27.5% increased from 26.7% last year, primarily due to higher field support investments and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $71.3 million, including $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $7.7 million from last year while the operating margin of 17.6%, including 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 19.2% in 2018.  Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $348.9 million increased 1.7%, reflecting a 3.5% organic sales gain, partially offset by $5.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain includes a double-digit increase in sales to OEM dealerships, principally through the segment's equipment solutions operation. Weakness in Europe again impacted RS&I's overall sales growth in the quarter. Gross margin of 46.3% decreased 100 basis -- 180 basis points from 48.1% last year, this is primarily due to the increased sales to OEM dealerships and higher material and other costs, partially offset by RCI savings. Sales for the equipment solutions operation tend to have lower gross margins and lower operating expenses associated with such activity.  The operating expense margin of 20.9% improved 130 basis points from 22.2% last year, primarily due to the aforementioned effect of higher sales to OEM dealerships and the benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $88.6 million compared to $88.7 million last year while the operating margin of 25.4% compared to 25.9% a year ago.  Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $60.6 million increased 4.8% versus Q2 of 2018. Revenue of $84.1 million was up 2.6% from a year ago. Financial services expenses of $23.5 million decreased $0.7 million, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, partially offset by higher expenses related to the growth in the portfolio. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% in the second quarter of 2019 and 1.2% in the second quarter of 2018. The average yield on finance receivables in the second quarter of 2019 were 17.6% as compared to 17.7% last year. The average yield on contract receivables was 9.1% in both periods.  Total loan originations of $263.4 million decreased $12.7 million or 4.6%, primarily due to decrease in originations of finance receivables resulting from lower year-over-year Snap-on Tools Group sales of big-ticket items.  Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.8 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $15.2 million in the second quarter. The 60-day-plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for the United States extended credit remains stable and reflects the seasonal improvement we typically experience in the second quarter.  As it relates to extended credit for finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12-month net losses of $50.4 million represented 3.0% of outstandings at quarter-end, that's down 9 basis points sequentially, supporting continued stabilization of the portfolio's credit metric performance.  Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $145.5 million in the quarter decreased $41.4 million from comparable 2018 levels, primarily reflecting net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including payments related to last quarter's legal settlement. Net cash used by investing activities of $65.2 million included net additions to finance receivables of $29 million, capital expenditures of $28 million and $8 million for the acquisition of Power Hawk, which provides rescue tools and related equipment for a variety of military, governmental and fire rescue and emergency operations.  Net cash used by financing activities of $73.1 million included cash dividends of $52.5 million and the repurchase of 365,000 shares of common stock for $60.1 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of the end of June, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $445.3 million of common stock under existing authorizations.  Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable decreased to $8.5 million from 2018 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 66 days compared to 67 days in 2018 year-end. Inventories increased $52 million from 2018 year-end, primarily to support higher levels of demand across critical industries, including demand for U.S. manufactured hand tools, new products as well as to improve service levels to our customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.9 at year-end 2018 and 2.7 in Q1 of 2019.  Our quarter end cash position of $164 million increased $23.1 million from 2018 year-end levels. Our net debt-to-capital ratio decreased to 22.5% from 24.2% at year-end 2018. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $700 million in available credit facilities. And as of quarter-end, we had $154.6 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, a reduction of $22.5 million since year-end 2018.  That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter. Encouraging progress. I think you could describe it -- we would describe it as encouraging and progress achieved against variation and headwind, challenges for sure. European operation, down. But a particular macro-related difficulty in the U.S. and the strong headwinds of unfavorable currency. We overcame with some encouraging positives : North American volume up; the Tools Group up in the U.S; new hand tool products driving enthusiasm and gain; at C&I the investments in torque, paying off with robust performance, matching the move to autonomy and precision and advancements in critical industries, it's gaining new military business and long-term contracts. And RS&I, a return of the OEM programs for vehicle dealerships, continuing strength in Mitchell 1 shops software. It all came together, overcoming the considerable difficulties of the current environment. Sales up organically 1.6%, OI margin at 20%, clearly among our best so far. And EPS up again to $3.22. And we believe we have the capabilities, the brands, the products and the opportunities to maintain that upwards earnings trajectory throughout the year and on into the quarters that follow. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our associates and our franchisees, Snap-on team. I know many of you are listening in or hear the call later. Once again, we made progress against the headwinds, and that advancement reflects your energy and efforts, your extraordinary contribution to our enterprise, for your achievement and accomplishment in prevailing, you have my congratulations. And for your dedication and your commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Scott Stember with CL King and Associates. Scott Stember : Just going over to the Tools Group, low single-digit increase in the U.S. I think we were mid-single digits in the first quarter, but it seems like some of the delta there is related to higher ticket items. That said, could you just give us a breakout of what tool storage, hand tools and specifically what some of the other categories during the course? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. You kind of got it set. I mean, I think if you look at the originations, originations are down. So that's the big-ticket items were weaker. I think originations were down like 4.4%, 4.6% in the quarter. But generally, it's around diagnostics.  If you look at that view, the diagnostics were lower than year-over-year. The Apollo launch was much bigger, it launches into a broader category of customers then the TRITON, which we launched. The TRITON launch was successful versus its prior people, but its prior iterations of that particular segments. And so we're pleased with the launch, but what we've learned with launching Intelligent Diagnostics is our franchisees tend to focus on it, and it tends to be a time-intensive sale. So it has uncertain results for the rest of the diagnostics lineup, and that's what happened in this time.  There also is a pretty strong activity around hand tools. Hand tools is up again in the quarter, and I think one of its highest levels ever so. Hand tools are pretty good. So that sort of the story in that quarter, that kind of balance in that situation.  Now you can look at the numbers, and you can see the margin and so on. So we had gross margins in the Tools Group. I think they were down 80 basis points. And there's about 50, 60 basis points of currency. So fundamentally, gross margin, that gross margin, the profitability was defined by what happened internationally where one of your levers around pricing can't use anymore, gross margins in the U.S. were actually up a little bit. Scott Stember : Okay. And just going over the pond over to the U.K. because it seems like that's where the lion's share of the tools weaknesses abroad, seems like it's getting a little bit worse. And we've all know about Brexit and some of the impact over there, but maybe just talk longer term about the business over there as it compares to your automotive repair market and the expectations for that business? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, I can do that. I can -- Go ahead, sorry. Scott Stember : No, go ahead. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Look, I can do that. Yes, Tools Group, depends on how you look at the U.K. U.K. was down higher percentages year-over-year in this quarter. It's down I think it was down high single digits in the first -- in last quarter, the first quarter, it was down double-digit, somewhat double digits in the second quarter. But actually, sequentially, the number was about the same. So I'm not sure how to really react to that. You understand what I mean? So it may be -- it should have been higher because it was the second quarter or not. We don't think there's anything structurally wrong with that business. I've been over to U.K. just recently, myself, talked to people and I talked to a number of people who are in the government there, and they say, \"People are quite uncertain.\" And one of the things we know about uncertainty in our business, we saw this in the big recession in 2009, is the technicians have -- are cash-rich, but confidence poor. If they start getting attracted or discouraged by this bad news for Brexit with the macro issues, they start back and away from longer payback items, and that's exactly what's happening in the U.K. You're seeing a lot of backing away from tool storage and diagnostics. So that's what's ailing the U.K., really.  You can see it in the -- you can see it in the originations. Originations are down in the U.S. but they're down bigger in the international and so that's really the situation. So when the confidence comes back, we believe we got a robust business there. Scott Stember : Got it. And then just lastly... Nicholas Pinchuk : God, I don't know. The problem with that is I don't know when the confidence is going to come back, but I think people feel like the Brexit situation is going to get solved. And I think it doesn't even have to be so. People have to believe that they see it way forward and now bring it back. I don't have any better answer than that for you. Scott Stember : Got it. And just the last question before I jump back in the queue is RS&I. Nice bounce back of OE dealership business. Can you just flash out how some of the software products did? Just try to frame that out as well as diagnostics. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Look, I think -- sure. Well, diagnostics is down in the Tools Group, and diagnostics in RS&I tends to follow that. It also had some external sales in the U.K. And the U.K. has kind of shut down a little bit so you see some of that. It sells around in addition to the Tools Group itself, the diagnostic sales some direct to certain elements of the U.K. government. That is a weakness from year-over-year. So diagnostics is down in the quarter, but Mitchell 1, Bahco. So Mitchell 1 is a great business and all we see is excelsior ever upward in the repair information products, car and truck repair. That's what I'm trying to say in my message there is that repair information for the garages seems to be going pretty well.  We believe that our diagnostics business goes well once we get our franchisees and the technicians comfortable with the huge power of Intelligent Diagnostics. Intelligent Diagnostics is a great product, just more complicated to sell because it's got so many nuances and features. So you saw -- you kind of -- so that all played out, I guess I'm giving you the features, but that all played out for repair diagnostics information in the independent shops to be about flat, about flat in that. And the OEM business, of course, was up nicely, and equipment was sort of flattish. I think it was up a little bit. So that's how diagnostics rolled out in the quarter, I mean not RS&I rolled out in the quarter. Operator : And next, we'll go to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : I had a question about the progress of TRITON if we go into a little more detail. I'm curious about the interplay of channel fill into sell-through. How the staging original rollouts goes, and if that's one of the drivers in the second half? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. It was a -- no, it was a national launch, but one thing that happened in the first two quarters of this year is we call them first time activations. Basically, we can see when a technician activates the software. And when the technician, not the franchisee, so we sell to the franchisee, he sells it into the industry, into the marketplace and that the technician who buys it get it activated. Well, activations are actually running ahead of our sales. So in fact, this is kind of a positive. TRITON itself, off to the franchisees met our expectations. It's not the segment that Apollo is. So met that expectations and, in fact, a little bit better than the last launch. The activations, and the activations always follow, and the activations so far are running ahead of our expectation. So we think that's kind of a positive sign, although who knows what will happen tomorrow, but the thing is that seems to be positive. So TRITON itself, I think, worked pretty well.  We've seen this phenomena. When we launched the Intelligent Diagnostics now, it tends to draw the attention of the franchisee who only has set 24 hours a day, and they tend to spend more time selling it because they love the product. Everybody loves the software, harder to explain, little more expensive. And so it tends to diminish what happens in the other product. That's what happened this time. That's why we had the downturn. So we had a good launch, but yet the other product didn't sell as the way they sold another period to the way we expected. What we're doing is -- so what we're doing is, I should add, what we're doing is, is that one of the things you see the OE and the Tools Group, one big component of that is the training seminars and the support systems for the franchisees to sell and to train the technicians and how to use this stuff and to realize how truly important it is and how they can't live without it. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then kind of a broad question on the second half. We're generally kind of banking on kind of a holding pattern within brand trends and mixed trends in the first half? Or there's some mix naturally kind of revert or unwind? Nicholas Pinchuk : Look, I don't think anybody -- we wouldn't be happy with continued sales in the U.S. at 1% for an extended period of time. We wouldn't be happy with that, of course. Yet, we do get variation from period-to-period. So that's why we think this is not a bad thing in this situation with these economics, but we would -- we stick to our view that this is a 4% growing business. And absent huge turbulence like what's happening in the U.K., I would call U.K. a singularity. I would call Australia being under economic arrest at least in our sector. So I kind of can outpour those and say, \"It really is in our business.\" We would expect it to get better.  Now the third quarter is always kind of squarely because we have the SFC and so on. And I'm not saying anything I haven't said 10 times before, but we still feel pretty confident. I think one of the challenges for us is to get that Intelligent Diagnostics down to an easier sale, a more natural sale and to get it out there, so it doesn't weigh down on our business. And then, of course, they keep coming with the new products. The hand tools are hotter than heck. If we can keep up that momentum, that's got to accrue to us. So if you look at our capital expenditures, we raised capital expenditures, and part of it is making the hand tool deliveries much more smooth, much smoother because we're investing in new facilities and our distribution systems in Crystal Lake and other places, in our hand tool factories like Milwaukee and other places. And some of our expenses in the quarter, the field support expenses was to support that distribution of hand tools, which were all through that distribution. And so on and so on. Christopher Glynn : Yes. Just had a last one. Any updates on capital allocation or strategic levers? And in particular, as you look at valuations, it's been a lower for a little while here. Any benefits to going private? What kind of board-level discussions do you have in some of those respects? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. We have discussions about this kind of thing all the time and so on. I think our -- we feel that -- look, we talk about capital allocation, we say we think this business has a lot of runway. So we think we can keep -- the best use of our capital is to invest in the business. And you can see it now we're investing in the hand tools. We're investing in the training of the franchisees to be able to sell this new -- this transformative diagnostic product better so we see that. Then we say, as we say, we have a dividend, we want to preserve the dividend and make sure it keeps going. We've never reduced it over the years. And then we look at share buyback. We bought back a significant number of shares in the quarter. I mean, I guess it supposedly can be a -- everybody can have a different view of what's a significant number of what we think was more than before. And we take advantage of when the stock price is in an inappropriate place, so we're not in a blackout period. And then we look at acquisitions, and we're looking at acquisitions as we speak. So we have all of those discussions all those things are discussed at the Board level and our level constantly. Probably, the Board and us talks about it regularly. Operator : And next, we'll go to David Leiker with Baird. David Leiker : I guess a couple of things to circle back around on. Nick, you did a great job at talking about some of the headwinds and some of the things that you're facing, and we've talked about them with you as well. You have -- and I just want to post this question to you as one of the hit that we talked about in the past and just see if there's any change in your view on it. But with 10 years into an economic recoveries, people have most everything that they need. You've talked about in the past about other use of money from your customers' pockets. Do you have any update, any thoughts on whether some of that might actually be behind the headwinds that you're facing right now from a demand perspective? Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't know. I mean, the thing is I don't think so. I don't think there's anything different now than before. Maybe our technicians get a little more ease of credit, but I continue to feel, David, that this is on us. Whatever is happening here is on us. When I go out and talk to the franchisees and I just -- like I said I talked, I was just on a truck the other day and I talked to a number of franchisees across the country, 1 in Texas, 1 in California and 1 in the Midwest. And they don't seem to see it that way, that there's a shrinking of demand. It's on us to try to allocate their time the best and get products that will attract them. I think that is the solution. We don't see a back office technician.  Now there can be, we had an interesting discussion, there can be a little bit of period-to-period variation. And one of the franchisees said, \"I live in a beer and Budweiser, a beer, a Budweiser and fireworks culture.\" In other words, around the 4th of July, everybody gets -- goes on vacation and they invest in fireworks and Budweiser. That's how we talked about it, so sales get down a little bit slow in the spirit. That's what he said. But I don't think -- he said it always comes back. So I don't think we don't see any indication of saturation or misdirection could be wrong, but nothing quantitatively or qualitatively said that. Certainly qualitatively, we're not seeing this qualitatively. We're seeing the salaries of the -- I think the salaries, the trailing 12 months grew by 4% for technicians. The technicians itself year-over-year grew by 1.7%. So that's BLS data. So we don't think there's -- and nominal spending on repair moved upwards a couple of percent. No real spending moved upwards a couple of percent year-over-year. So I think, I just think it's still robust, its execution. And one of the things I tried to mention here is, boy, trying to support that launch of Intelligent Diagnostics, it's a revelation, it's a revolution. And when I talk to franchisees, they need help doing it so that's what we're working on : To try to boil things down but just be the quick 7-minute pitch that will convince people. David Leiker : Okay. And then just two numbers related questions. One is on the working capital. Although, if you could and I am looking at Q2 versus Q2 year-over-year, it's the cash flow statement. And if there's a way you could break that down, I know currency is going to be -- play a role in there, and there's probably some acquisitions, but just the drivers behind the increase in working capital here year-over-year. Aldo Pagliari : The biggest increase is if you look at our divisions, the biggest increase is inventory associated with the Snap-on Tools Group, our European-based hand tools operation and industrial. Those are the ones that have been adding by the way the most, I'd say, across the range of most new products. We have new product additions, it's certainly one of them. The industrial, more specifically, has been pleasantly engaged in more project-based activity in assembly of kits, and they've been compiling more inventory to service those customers. As an example, the U.S. military being a significant one. And we're trying to improve our service levels, where when you have such a variety of SKUs that we offer across the board and you're somewhat dealing with an environment where people can use discretion to buy, maybe a little bit of an impulse element in there as well. Last thing you want to do is not being able to meet demand because you don't have the inventory on the shelf. So we are willing to err on the side of having adequate levels of inventory across those broad number of SKUs. And at least you got a couple of product ramp ups that are occurring. So for example, we're developing new leaps in some of our factories, and that requires some ramp-up investment. And our inventories are [indiscernible] as well. We're getting it a little low, we're trying to take advantage of the situation where we can and buy smartly. And that divestments is what drives the -- the operating variance, David, it's about $52 million. If you look year-over-year, you're taking out the effects of currency and acquisitions to give you a number. David Leiker : Yes. Okay. And then secondly, you'd called out in the corporate expense line there a little bit of a variance there. You referenced there in particular instead of comp. Was any of that a reversal from what might have been accrued in Q1? Aldo Pagliari : Well, there's an element of that, but you have a lot of performance-based compensation that runs through the P&L. So it is related actually to the stock price performance, which accreted more in Q2 of last year, it was actually what it did in Q2 of this year. So you get some variation there, but also the timing of certain expenses, some of them related to legal matters, some of them are related to other just corporate spending. Those are account essentially. So if you look at the back half of the year, my expectation, we typically spend in the quarter. More typical quarter, you're spending in the range of $22 million to $24 million. I see no reason that would not be a good forecast as we look to the back half of the year in terms of our spend. Operator : And next, we'll go to Curtis Nagle with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Curtis Nagle : I guess just starting off. So I guess starting out just thinking about the gross margin for tools. It looks like currency was a fairly decent size headwind. How do we think about that for the remainder of the year? And is that primarily Canada? Or is that Europe? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, the big kahunas there are you said Canada, but the U.K. and Australia. Those are the big players in the transactions there. They pretty much dominate that 80 basis points of currency of gross margin change. And so it's pretty much outside United States.  And how this works out is normally, when currency has happened to us in the past, we've had RCI and the lever, and we have 2 methods of offsetting RCI and pricing, local pricing. But when you're down several quarters in a row and you've got double-digit deterioration in the U.K. and you've got some down ticket sales in Australia, you're appetite to price is a lot lower. So therefore, you're seeing that roll through, and that's really what's happening. The fact that the currency is visiting on the places where it's much more reluctant to test the waters or to push the pricing because we want the volume backup. That's really what's dominating that situation. U.S., as I said, I know a lot of people have been talking about discounting and promotions and all sorts, but actually it's up again in the U.S. because it's our people in the Tools Group are masters of making heat and light out of programs and really they don't, by and large, don't change their margins. The programs come out and they have different phases and the same names in all kinds of things, but their idea is to generate enthusiasm both with the franchisees and the customers. And I think given some times, it's they often do, but that doesn't mean we're actually net-net discounting. Curtis Nagle : Got it. And perhaps not to extrapolate too much, but just as kind of focusing on the comment about spending behavior and maybe shifts to things like fireworks and Budweiser, which theoretically might be a reference to 4th of July. Was that a forward comment in terms of what's going on with demand? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, it's actually -- it was Fourth of July. It was about -- look, it was kind of like he says, \"Look, when it gets warm, your technicians are thinking about other things and repairing cars as a simple\" -- well, it's kind of an anecdotal comment. It wasn't meant to -- ought to be a forecast of any kind. I was just trying to give you a view. David asked me if there was variation and appetite for buying or people decided to focus elsewhere. I said I didn't think so, except for this kind of very, very temporal thing that one of my franchisees or several of my franchisees say when weather gets good and vacation's coming, people may not buy as much then, but they make it up later. That's all. That's all. Operator : And next, we'll go to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : I guess I wanted to sort of go back to a couple kind of bigger picture questions. And credit has always been kind of a very important part of your value proposition to the marketplace. And so if you advance from the premise that people are using less credit now, does that leave you a little more exposed price elasticity on the tools? And you've always had a pretty high quality tool, not to beat it about it, but also a premium-priced tool and I'm wondering if maybe as credit become -- people become maybe a little less credit dependent just late in the cycle, if people are just becoming more price-sensitive and you're feeling that. Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't think we're feeling price sensitivity any more than we always have. I mean, as you say, everybody's always known that if you buy a Snap-on tool, it's going to be more expensive. And I wouldn't characterize -- I think the characterization you're saying is a little bit not the way we would. We would say people aren't using, aren't buying big-ticket items from us, [indiscernible]. But when they're buying big-ticket items, they're using credit, and RA is credit itself, remember?  Remember that when a guy buys a set of wrenches or a power tool, $600 power tool, he's probably paying $50 a week, and that's stretched out over 12 weeks or maybe, maybe even sometimes 10 weeks or 15 weeks, depending on how the franchisee does it. So everything is about credit, and the RA business is up. So I wouldn't say that credit, it doesn't appear to us, David, that credit is a question. People are reluctant to take it.  Now if you're saying, if you tell me the U.K., then I don't know. I think the U.K., they could be saying, well, I don't know what's going to happen next week. So maybe I'm not going to -- that's where my comment is about, longer payback items. I think we find when pessimism or uncertainty seizes the psyche of the working men and women, including the technicians, they tend to invest in shorter payback things like power tools and hand tools and shy away from the longer payback stuff. That happens. We used to have seen that in the U.S. That's not a phenomenon here. David MacGregor : Could you just talk about -- No, I appreciate you addressing that, Nick. Can you just talk about field inventory levels and inventory on the truck? Clearly, in terms of your reported numbers, your inventory numbers are up but just talk about what you're seeing out there and... Nicholas Pinchuk : Inventory, I've seen -- look, I think -- David, I think inventory, if anything, I think our numbers say they're down slightly per truck, but it might be a blip -- I'm not sure that that's irrelevant. But having gone up, I mean the sales off the van have matched I think the sales to the van. So there's not -- we're not seeing any kind of buildup in recent -- the only buildup we've seen over time has been a buildup associated with the sales of the van network. But in general, recently, we're not seeing that kind of buildup so I wouldn't say -- the one thing I would say that I will say that I did say about diagnostics, I don't know what to make of this yet because it's not we don't have it upwards but it appears as though there's more -- there's been more activations than their buy, in other words, sales of the truck of diagnostic bodies and software activations than we have sold to the truck. So from an inventory point of view, that would tend to be a diminishment of that, you would think on the van, you would think. David MacGregor : Can you reconcile -- sure. Nick, how do you square that with originations being down again? And I guess there's been couple of quarters in a row now where your sell-in has exceeded the originations. And I understand there's a timing difference, but that would happen -- last quarter, we would have seen that correct normalized. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, David, there is a timing difference. Originations are down because the sales and diagnostics in the quarter weren't that good. That's why -- and so as I tried to lay that out a little bit, maybe I was unsuccessful, but that's the thing. One of our 2 major -- the big-ticket item of diagnostics wasn't as strong as in prior quarters. And so yes, there are timing differences and so on, but that accounts diagnostics account for the lion's share of the variation year-over-year originations. So I think... David MacGregor : Understood. Last question for me is just you made reference in your prepared remarks to franchisee health metrics remained favorable. In other words, I guess you're still in the green zone, so to speak. Can you just talk to the second derivative on those metrics? And just maybe give us example, 1 or 2, that you put a higher level of emphasis on in terms of driving comfort that you're still in good shape? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Look, second derivative of, let's say, terminations, people leaving the system. Really the first derivative, it's been pretty flat. So I think generally the second derivative has been generally stable. It's not moving either way. In fact, I think that improved a little bit. It got slightly better in this quarter, so you would say the second derivative, I don't know, I'm trying to think of how that would work in terms of polarity, but anyway, it was favorable in this particular quarter.  Now a really small amount, but generally, that's been about the same for several quarters now. It has been going I think -- I don't know I want to think back about 3 quarters ago, it had been up to then and had been going upwards, going the other way, had been rising, and maybe even up to the fourth quarter. It had been raising a little bit and so now it's kind of gone back the other way in terms of second derivative. So I don't know what to make of that, whether that's positive or negative. Generally, those things get driven by retirement.  The difference between the -- what drove it upwards was retirements by people who had spent more times on the van, and they wanted to go to Hawaii or something for their retirement. And so those are the kinds of things, which are making the difference we saw more of those. I think this quarter, we saw rather less. Still up from, say, slightly from, say, 18 months ago, but down from, say, 5 years ago. David MacGregor : Okay. And if I segue one of my last question, if I could. Just the diagnostics returns, was that a meaningful headwind to organic growth in the Tool segment this quarter? Nicholas Pinchuk : Returns, you mean people giving us back diagnostics even to something? David MacGregor : Correct. Right. Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't know. I don't necessarily check all these things, but I don't think so. I haven't heard of that. No one's mentioned that to me so I don't think it was actually. I think it's essentially was, this is -- we sold enough TRITONs. We didn't sell enough of the other stuff. Operator : And next, we'll go to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Nick, that ADAS product that you talked about, is that targeted specifically to the independent shop versus the franchise dealer? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Yes, yes, it is specifically targeted. The idea, Gary, is to make it versatile so it can accommodate the specificities of systems that are authored by different OEMs. It's pretty -- the whole ADAS thing is becoming very important for us. So one of the things we like is in Mitchell 1, we have a particular ADS suite where when people are repairing the ADS systems, they are -- they're able to go in a particular section of that repair information and can deal with ADS systems and the terms in which describe ADAS. And so it's one of the things that's driving Mitchell 1 upwards, Mitchell 1 was very strong in the quarter actually. Gary Prestopino : Is that -- would that be considered a big ticket item must-have for the independent repair shops going forward? I mean, relative to the other diagnostics equipment so. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, I don't know. I think it's certainly as expensive as a diagnostic unit so it's a big ticket item, but the independent repair shop is still slightly different. They make -- sometimes independent repair shops pay cash or credit card for these kinds of things. They don't always borrow from us necessarily. So it wouldn't necessarily impact the originations, it might, but I don't think so in this case. So I wouldn't do that.  The thing about this is just to make sure it's clear, everything now when you hit your bumper now you need to worry about the ADAS systems. It's a -- it becomes a -- you have set the sensors that are in the bumper and you have to recalibrate just to be put on the bumper. So that's why there's more and more demand to this. The more there is the peripheral sensors, the more they have to deal with this. And that's why we're pretty enthusiastic about this, and it's been helping us, I think. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then just to be clear, a lot of talk here and the headwind that you saw in the U.S., if there was a headwind, was really revolving around diagnostics. It wasn't around tool storage and the bread and butter. Nicholas Pinchuk : No. Tool storage is kind of flattish. It's okay. We've got tools storage okay. It was up versus the last time, quite being up sequentially. It was up so we felt pretty good about that. It's not's tool storage, it's diagnostics. I'm sure we'd like to have -- look, power tools is down, too, but that has to do with the launch, which is coming and people are waiting for like -- there are a lot of things I'd like to -- there are some things that I'd like to have better, of course, but if you will ask me to say, \"Well, what do you have to fix to make -- to get back to where you are?\" I think it has to do with making sure that diagnostics works [indiscernible]. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then last question, I don't know if you have this, although if you have this, what was the negative impact of currency on EPS in Q3 and Q4 of last year for each quarter? Do you have that handy? Nicholas Pinchuk : I think it was positive. I think it was positive last year, yes. Aldo Pagliari : So I think, Gary, it's still going to be a headwind if we get into the back half of the year, not as the currency rates stay right where they are right now, we're still going to see some negativity in Q3 and a little bit in Q4. So it's gotten worse is what we would have talked about on our April call with you, but currency is still going to be a headwind over the balance of the year. It was really flat in Q3 of last year and it was about $0.06 negative in Q4 of last year. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Because I looked back, and the sales impact was about a negative $12.5 million in Q3 and a negative $17.10 million in Q4 so that's why we're just wondering. So you're saying it would be flattened -- the impact in Q3 was flat overall from currency even with the negative sales? Aldo Pagliari : Yes. No. Sometimes the sales is not the indicator to what gets to the bottom line, right? It's transactions, particularly in the Tools Group in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada is embedded within the activity that you see in the gross margin line, not the sales line. All we're saying is last year, there was no EPS impact. There is a -- actually it was probably 0.2%of OI, I think, here in the last year. And this year, I expect it to be negative at rates they will have to that. Nicholas Pinchuk : What happens, Gary, your sales gets driven by the euro and the pounds and the Canadian dollar. And then when you talk about profitability, you see a much bigger influence of the pounds and the Aussie dollar and the Canadian dollar. So there are different currencies that impact us for sales in the quarter. Aldo Pagliari : And as an example, the pounds run from 1.24 to 1.25. It's worse than where it was at last year. Operator : And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Sara Verbsky for any additional closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.

We believe that our third quarter again demonstrated Snap-on\u2019s ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, overcoming periodic and regional variation. The full third quarter results did demonstrate encouraging elements of progress that were somewhat attenuated by turbulence and challenged geographies and by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. Like the last quarter, we had continuing progress in the U.S., up overall 3.2% with clear growth across our operations and across our groups. And again, this quarter that advancement was muted by a continuing pause in Europe, primarily in the UK, but also in country \u2013 in the Nordic countries, in Germany and Italy, several of the bellwether markets. And as I\u2019ve said, there was also a meaningful impact from currency translation and transaction. So we had significant headwinds, but once again, our advantages prevailed. Organic sales were up 1.4%. Sales gains in the critical industries in OEM dealerships and diagnostics and information for independent repair shop owners and continued growth in the U.S. van channel; advancements in hand tools, diagnostics, repair information, customized tool sets and software. It all combined to meet the turbulence and the variation and it moved us forward again. Opco operating income before financial services of $167.7 million compared to $173.1 million last year, and it included $4.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency. RCI was evident in the quarter, but it was not \u2013 it wasn\u2019t able to offset the negative foreign currency, the weakness in Europe and the investments that we\u2019re making in the field \u2013 in field support and training for the Tools Group that\u2019s aimed at enabling our powerful new products. For financial services, operating income of $61 million grew $1.7 million from last year\u2019s $59.3 million. That result combined with opco for a consolidated operating margin of 23.2% compared with 23.7% last year. Quarterly EPS at $2.96 was up $0.11 or 3.9% above last year \u2013 of last year\u2019s $2.85 or 2.8% above last year\u2019s adjusted EPS, which excludes the one-time U.S. tax legislation transition charge that was in the 2018 third quarter results. So now let\u2019s speak about the markets. We believe the automotive repair environment continues to be favorable. The Tools Group had registered a similar performance to the second quarter with a rise in the U.S., being offset by turbulence in international geographies. We believe we occupy a position of significant potential with the Tools Group. Vehicles are getting more complex. Our products are clearly keeping pace. The face to face positioning of our franchisees are perfect to guide technicians in wielding those powerful devices effectively. It\u2019s a great advantage in this changing environment and a considerable opportunity as we train our franchisees to provide that special guidance efficiently. On the other side of automotive repair \u2013 of auto repair, Repair Systems & Information or the RS&I Group, encouraging progress in the quarter, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence with repair shop owners and managers with a broad range of continually improving products; more intelligent, more comprehensive and more capable. The shops are changing and upgrading both dealerships and independents, and RS&I is capitalizing on that trend, helping the shop fix vehicles right the first time and it\u2019s paying off. For the critical industries, verticals like military, education, aerospace, important segments, we see significant progress. We like the quarter for critical industries, we like the way they\u2019re sounding and we like the way they\u2019re trending. We do believe we\u2019re well positioned to confront the challenges and make progress along our runways for growth. At the same time though, it\u2019s clear that we have ongoing potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation Processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI, they\u2019ve never been more important than these periods of multiple headwinds. They\u2019re a constant driver of our progress, helping counter the turbulence, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology. And in this quarter, Snap-on Value Creation, customer connection and innovation drove growth in the face of challenges and led to more prestigious product awards. Just in this quarter, Snap-on was prominently represented with 13 Professional Tool & Equipment News, PTEN, People\u2019s Choice Awards. These are the awards where the actual users, the technicians make the selection. We have 13. We\u2019re also recognized with six PTEN Innovation Awards, and we were honored with three MOTOR Magazine Top 20 awards. An essential driver of Snap-on growth, Snap-on\u2019s power, is innovative product that makes work easier. It\u2019s always been our strength. And these awards, hard won, are testimony that great Snap-on products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task, maintaining forward progress. That\u2019s the environment. Now we\u2019ll move to the individual operating groups. Let\u2019s start with C&I. Sales of $335.3 million in the quarter, increased $5.5 million, including $1.1 million from acquisitions and $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth was $9.5 million or 2.9% and that was gained pretty much across all the divisions. Operating margins were lower 14.4% versus the 16.1% recorded last year. That\u2019s primarily reflecting critical \u2013 the critical industry sales being more weighted in this quarter towards the lower margin military sector. From a broad perspective, C&I focused on critical industries, outside the vehicle garage showed broad-based gains with another year-over-year increase now accomplished for 13 straight quarters. We continue to rise in critical industries. We see it as a very good positive. It\u2019s a favorable market environment and we\u2019re addressing it with innovative new products aimed at solving tasks of consequence and results encouraging. The third quarter did see advancements in new products like our new power tool, our new CT9075 half-inch cordless impact wrench, the best balance of power and weight in the market, a five-amp power lithium battery, 900 foot pounds of sustained bolting force, 1,250 foot pounds of breakaway torque. That\u2019s big power. But beyond the power, the CT9075 it\u2019s been designed and manufactured for long service life with best-in-class key components, high torque brushless motor, a full body impact hammer and a very robust anvil, with both the hammer and the anvil, key components for any power tool, any impact power tool, manufactured in our Murphy, North Carolina plant using special alloy steel, a material employed when superior toughness and superior strength are paramount. We believe and testing shows that our new impact has a clear durability advantage, holding its power for many more cycles even when removing the most tightly torque fasteners. When the work is critical, the CT9075 is the answer faster, more powerful, tougher. Now we only released it to a few of our regions, but where it\u2019s been available, it\u2019s been a huge hit. Word travels fast, and technicians all over the country are pumped. They want this tool. It\u2019s already hit our $1 million product list and it\u2019s on its way to much, much more. Customer connection showed us what we needed to make a difference, speed, durability and power and the CT9075 has all that and the market reception confirms it. In this quarter, from our FASTORQ acquisition, we also added to our industrial torque and tensioning key product lines from penetrating industrial \u2013 the critical industries. We added offerings by \u2013 torque and tensioning offerings by introducing the pneumatic SpinTORQ 360 degree torque wrench, utilizes a double-enveloping worm gear design. It\u2019s unique. It\u2019s a unique and focused product developed for critical industries and offering a significant speed advantage over standard ratcheting hydraulic wrenches because the SpinTORQ continually rotates the fastener, while \u2013 rather than turning what hydraulics \u2013 rather than doing what hydraulics do, turning a few degrees, ratcheting back and forth, and then repeating. Bolting time with the SpinTORQ is greatly reduced. But the new wrench, not only faster, it\u2019s also operates with higher accuracy. A built-in torque control stall system delivers a bolting tension within plus or minus 5%, an uncommonly narrow range. It\u2019s also safer. The secondary trigger design focuses operators, forces operators to keep their hands away from pinch points, avoiding serious accidents that can happen. It\u2019s especially effective in oil and gas, power generation and mining where downtime is critical and higher travel distances for fasteners can be a significant time challenge. We launched SpinTORQ in July and as expected the reception of critical initiatives has been strong. Products like these aimed at tasks of increasing complexity that help drive our progress across the critical initiatives and we\u2019ll keep working customer connection and innovation. So the advancements keep coming. C&I maintaining its momentum, extending in critical industries, moving Snap-on outside of the garage and it\u2019s working. Now onto the Tools Group, organic sales flat, down 0.3%, continued growth in the U.S. up low single-digits, continued growth in the U.S. up low single-digits was offset again by variation internationally. Operating income in the quarter of $53 million, including the effect of negative foreign currency and the cost of investing in \u2013 was affected by negative currency and negative foreign currency and the cost of investing in more field support and training that compares to $59.3 million in 2018. Now the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference or SFC. This year, it was in Washington, more than 8,000 people were there, franchisees, their guests and the Snap-on team. We had sales and profit growth seminars and extensive training and intelligent diagnostics. It was all combined with 141,000 square foot product expo, showcasing our latest innovations. For the franchisees, it\u2019s an opportunity for learning, for touching and ordering new products and for recharging their Snap-on batteries. And for the company, it\u2019s an opportunity to gauge our franchisees\u2019 outlook on the business. Well, one measure order volume was up mid single-digits off the SFC with most product categories showing gains over last year. And I spoke to with many of the franchisees during the weekend and I can attest they display a lot of confidence in our business and considerable optimism in their future with Snap-on. We do believe our franchisees continue to grow stronger and we\u2019re continuing to invest in their future. And if you are with us at DC, you could see it clearly. We\u2019re investing in field support and training. We\u2019re investing in building our franchisees\u2019 ability to use their direct interface with technicians to communicate the unique capability of the Snap-on product line. We did that at the SFC and the diagnostic training session, well attended and well appreciated and it was a clear success. We have confidence in the power of our product line and there are real reasons for the confidence. You heard about the product awards. Well beyond that, there\u2019s a continuous stream of other great new offerings, attention getters that make repairs easier and most of the challenges and attention getters that make repairs easier and meet the challenges of increasing vehicle complexity. You\u2019re convinced of this when you see the innovations like our Snap-on FJ175, an exclusive 1.75 ton high performance aluminum jack manufactured in our Elkmont, Alabama facility. It\u2019s only 47 pounds. One of the benefits of having aircraft grade aluminum chassis components, at that lightweight, it\u2019s very portable, perfect for off \u2013 on the road repairs outside the garage. It\u2019s capable of lifting up to 3,500 pounds. It elevates up to 18 inches and features a low entry point of 3.4 inches. It can accommodate the range of vehicles, low ride to hard ride, low ride to high ride that challenges the repair shops of today. It\u2019s got a premium pump, improved hydraulics and higher compound ratio so it works effectively even with one hand, a considerable field advantage actually. The diamond knurl handle improves the grip and the unit\u2019s portable design makes it great for a wide variety of situations. Now let\u2019s talk about tool storage, among the new products launched, the SFC \u2013 SFC was the highly anticipated double-bank EPIQ utility vehicle both massive storage capacity of over 128,000 cubic inches. It\u2019s dubbed the EUV. It\u2019s a giant box. That includes our signature SpeeDrawer and Power Locker features that are aimed at making it easier for customers to keep their drawers organized and their power tools fully charged with five outlets and two USB ports. The new unit has clear visual appeal. It\u2019s a design that evokes a race team pit way and everybody wants one. Striking 17 \u2013 it\u2019s got striking 17 inch wheels and a number of unique custom details like a special Snap-on logo center wheel cap, a distinction that\u2019s only available on the EUV. It\u2019s available in several colors and it is a mobile monster and it\u2019s still like it. It\u2019s designed to handle the very large tool loads by reinforcing the standard corner gussets in a scene construction with additional top, bottom and side support, it\u2019s our strongest ever roll cab and I kind of test, it was a center of attention at the SFC tool show, innovation and eye appeal, a winning combination. Well, that\u2019s the Tools Group, enthusiastic SFC, continued growth in the U.S., and innovative new products driving the way forward. Now RS&I, organic sales were up 3.2% with mid-single-digit increases in both sales to OEM dealerships and sales of diagnostics and repair \u2013 sales of diagnostics and repair information to independent shops. Those gains were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in the sales of undercar equipment, particularly reflecting weaker sales in Europe. Despite the higher mix of sales in OEM, essential programs, which tend to have a lower operating margin than the group average, RS&I OI margin was 25.8% quite strong, a rise of 10 basis points from the last year. Once again, RCI innovation and software drove the progress and overcame the headwinds. Our Mitchell 1 division continued to expand its array of industry-leading productivity solutions by releasing its latest edition of our pro-demand repair information software, which includes new enhancements to wiring and proponent diagrams, select the replacement part, pro-demand now opens a specific component diagram of that item, no needed to scroll through multiple pages, a big time saver. The new software also clearly highlights related wires in the surrounding harness, more time saved. Both of those productivity features are industry first and they\u2019re quite popular. We also launched other great products in the period, products like our M525F enhanced digital multimeter, another of our next generation horizontal multimeters. The units has a larger four inch color display for easier reading and quicker symbol identification. Today, interpreting a wide range of electrical impulses is necessary for diagnosing the circuit or component problems of today\u2019s vehicles. The new enhanced multimedia measures ohms and AC, DC voltage and true RMS, AC, DC amperage frequency and capacitance, and a rate covering most automotive electrical needs, and it\u2019s safe. It\u2019s safe for use on hybrid that\u2019s confirmed by its CAT III 1,000 volt and CAT IV 600 volt hybrid safety ratings. In addition, it\u2019s got some clever special operating conveniences like test lead storage and built-in tilt stand. Initial product launch was strong and made the multimeter another of our hit products. So to wrap up RS&I, growth in OEM dealerships improving position with repair shop \u2013 independent repair shop owners and managers, expanding product lines, maintaining and improving strong margins. Well, that\u2019s the highlights of our quarter. C&I continuing its positive trends, extending across critical industries, Tools Group; matching the rise in vehicle complexity, RS&I, expanding in the shop, building sales and profitability. Progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement and EPS $2.96 in the quarter, 2.8% higher than last year, progress hard won against turbulence is encouraging. Now I\u2019d turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results have summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $901.8 million in the quarter were up 0.4% reflecting a 1.4% organic sales gain, $2.9 million of acquisition related sales and $11.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflected low-single-digit growth in both the commercial and industrial and the Repair Systems and Information segments. Sales in the Snap-on Tools segment were essentially flat, but included low-single-digit gains in the U.S. franchise operations. Similar to last quarter, on a year-over-year basis, sales to customers in the United States increased across all segments while sales in Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, continue to exhibit weakness. Consolidated gross margin of 49.7% compared to 50.5% last year. The 80 basis point decrease primarily reflects increased sales in lower gross margin businesses, 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 31.1% improved 10 basis points from 31.2% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $167.7 million, including $4.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $173.1 million last year. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 18.6%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 19.3% last year. Financial services revenue of $84.1 million and operating earnings of $61 million increased 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively, from 2018, primarily reflecting year-over-year growth in our financial services portfolio. Consolidated operating earnings of $228.7 million, including $4.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $232.4 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 23.2% compared to 23.7% last year. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 23.5% compared to 24% last year. During Q3 2018, our tax rate included a 90 basis point charge related to the implementation of tax legislation in the United States. Finally, net earnings on $164.6 million, $2.96 per share, including a $0.06 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $163.2 million or $2.85 per share a year ago. In Q3 2018, excluding a $0.03 per share charge related to taxes, adjusted earnings per share was $2.88. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 7, sales of $335.3 million in the quarter increased 1.5%, reflecting a 2.9% organic sales gain and $1.1 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $5.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth included a mid-single-digit gain in our specialty tools business, as well as low-single-digit increases in both the segment\u2019s European-based hand tools business and to customers in critical industries, particularly sales to the U.S. military. Gross margin of 37.9% decreased 170 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and lower gross margin businesses, including the aforementioned sales to the military. The operating expense margin of 23.5% was unchanged from last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $48.3 million decreased $4.7 million from last year, and the operating margin of 14.4% compared to 16.1% in 2018. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $385.2 million decreased 1.2%, primarily due to $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic sales were essentially flat, reflecting a mid-single-digit decline internationally, partially offset by a low-single-digit increase in the United States. Gross margin of 43.4% including 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects decreased 20 basis points from last year. The operating expense margin of 29.6% increased from 28.4% last year, primarily due to higher field support investments. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $53 million, including $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased $6.3 million from last year, while the operating margin of 13.8%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 15.2% in 2018. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $322.7 million increased 2.6%, reflecting a 3.2% organic sales gain and $1.8 million of acquisition related sales, partially offset by $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes mid-single-digit gains in both sales to OEM dealerships and in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These increases were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment, reflecting weaker sales in Europe. Gross margin of 47.7% decreased 100 basis points from 48.7% last year, primarily due to the increased sales to OEM dealerships through the equipment solutions operation, which tend to have lower gross margins and lower operating expenses associated with such activity. The operating expense margin of 21.9% improved 110 basis points from 23% last year, primarily due to the aforementioned effect of higher sales to OEM dealerships and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings from the RS&I Group of $83.3 million increased $2.6 million from last year, and the operating margin of 25.8% compared to 25.7% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $61 million increased 2.9% versus the third quarter of 2018. Revenue of $84.1 million was up 2.6% from a year ago. Financial services expenses of $23.1 million compared to $22.7 million last year. As a percentage of the portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% in the third quarters of both 2019 and 2018. The average yield on finance receivables was 17.7% in the third quarter of 2019 and in the third quarter of 2018. The average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% in both periods. Total loan originations of $253.5 million decreased $13.5 million or 5.1%, primarily due to a decrease in originations of finance receivables, resulting from lower year-over-year Snap-on Tools franchisee sales of big-ticket items that utilize extended credit. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.8 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $12.3 million in the third quarter. The 60-day-plus delinquency rate of 1.7% for U.S. extended credit remains stable and reflects the seasonal increase we typically experience in the third quarter. As it relates to extended credit for finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12 month net losses of $49.9 million, represented 2.97% of outstandings at quarter end, down 3 basis points sequentially, supporting continued stabilization of the portfolio\u2019s credit metric performance. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $131.1 million in the quarter, increased $1.3 million from comparable 2018 levels, primarily do the higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $76.8 million included net additions to finance receivables of $15.4 million, capital expenditures of $29.6 million and $29.6 million for the acquisition of Cognitran, which specializes in flexible, modular and highly scalable software as a service products for OEM customers and their dealers. Net cash used by financing activities of $49.5 million included cash dividends of $52.3 million and the repurchase of 400,000 shares of common stock for $59.7 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of the end of September, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $390.6 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable decreased $7.8 million from 2018 year end. Days sales outstanding of 66 days compared to 67 days in 2018 year end. Inventories increased $79.7 million from 2018 year end, primarily to support higher levels of demand across critical industries, including demand for U.S. manufactured hand tools, new products as well as to improve service levels to our customers. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.9 at year end 2018. Our quarter end cash position of $167.5 million increased $26.6 million from 2018 year end levels. Our net debt-to-capital ratio decreased to 23.5% from 24.2% at year end 2018. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities as we entered into a new five year $800 million multi-currency revolving credit facility on September 16, which amends and restates the previous facility. As of quarter end, we had $218.8 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding, an increase of $41.7 million since year end 2018. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance, and I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, that\u2019s our third quarter. The results demonstrate encouraging elements of progress attenuated by turbulent geographies and by unfavorable perms. Overall organic growth at 1.4%, the results of progress in the U.S. growing at 3.2% challenged by slippage in Europe, where sales decreased and slide \u2013 and there was slides in the UK, the Nordic countries and German. The Tools Group about flat, decreasing 0.3% continued modest growth in the U.S. offset by international turbulence, increasing vehicle complexity matched by powerful new products and investment in training, making it possible for the franchisees to sell our enhanced offerings and the unique capabilities that they have effectively. Enabling franchisees to leverage their face to face advantage. C&I up 2.9% organically, with each division contributing to the continuing extension in critical industries and RS&I rising 3.2% organically, further progress and expanding with OEM dealerships and independent shop, hardware and software driving growth. Overall OI margin of 18.6%, down 70 basis points, but still strong given the turbulence. It all came together for an EPS of $2.96, up 2.8% as adjusted, despite the challenges. Our markets, vehicle technicians, critical industries, emerging economies, and repair shop owners and managers offer ongoing opportunity and we believe we have the position, the capability and the focus to take advantage of those possibilities and to continue our positive trend through the end of this year and on into 2020 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019ll talk directly to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening. When I speak of position of capability in a focus, I speak of you. The gains we\u2019ve made and the advancements we anticipate reflect your extraordinary contributions. For the progress you\u2019ve achieved, you have my congratulations and for your unfailing commitment and dedication to our team, you have my thanks. Now I\u2019d turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Gary Prestopino. Gary Prestopino : Thanks. Hey Nick, could you maybe just give us your best guess and your thoughts on if we get a Brexit deal, how that is \u2013 how that impacts your UK, as well as your European business? Nick Pinchuk : It\u2019s hard to judge, but what \u2013 it\u2019s like this, the pound, just talking about the pound, it\u2019s worth 40% of the profit impact and about a third of the sales impact. UK, if you think about it, the way our business is a rig, we have a number of businesses in UK, but it\u2019s a place where technicians own their own tools. So Tools Group has a particularly strong position there. So a lot of the markets were kind of exposed in the UK, I think it might be the second or third largest market for us. If it gets better, first of all, if the current goes positive, that\u2019s one good thing for us. And then secondly, I think, my view is, is that there hasn\u2019t been an organized areas, an organized economy, an economic or commercial angst that equals Brexit in a long time. And so you can hear it from the marketplace that people are worried about the future, what\u2019s going to happen commercially and therefore they focused more on the items that only have short paybacks, that gets resolved all that changes. So I think they\u2019re \u2013 if you think about it as our second or third largest market, it comes back to normal I don\u2019t know the time constants to which it comes back to normal, but I have to believe it\u2019s pretty good. Pretty quick. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Sure. Gary Prestopino : And then, could you maybe just comment on what kind \u2013 did you see any growth in the tool storage area year-over-year? Given that you\u2019ve put out a whole bunch of new products out there? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, well the tool storage, what you want to look at is the tool storage out of the SFC and we did see growth out of the SFC, so that\u2019s the big events in this quarter. I\u2019ve always say the third quarter is squarely, you can\u2019t figure any \u2013 you can\u2019t extrapolate any trends out of the third quarter, particularly because we had people coming back from vacations and the distributors in Europe are off for part of it, but also because we have the SFC and that creates variations in the behaviors of the franchisees, they usually wait for this and a lot of it has to do with \u2013 the success with tool storage has to do with how it came out of the SFC and it came out okay out of the SFC. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. Nick Pinchuk : Good. Operator : We will take our next question from David Leiker with Baird. David Leiker : All right. Good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Aldo Pagliari : Hi, David. David Leiker : Nick or Aldo, on the Tools Group, we\u2019ve talked about this, but I just want to dig through this. The higher spending level is not driving revenue and that\u2019s a missing part of the equation of this story. So I guess \u2013 is the issue there that, that spending \u2013 how do you measure the effectiveness of that spending, if that\u2019s working? Nick Pinchuk : Well, here look, I think, actually it\u2019s pretty simple. You\u2019re looking for more sales. So I think that\u2019s certainly it. So the ultimate measure is to see more sales and we did see diagnostics, this sort of \u2013 we had pretty good focus on diagnostics to the SFC, those seminars were well attended. The feedback we got, I got personally and we got generally from the people in the surveys is very good about the attendance and the roll out of the SFC to take up out of the SFC was pretty good. Now what happens is the SFC product ends up being late in the quarter, so you can\u2019t really judge by the third, it\u2019s a very iffy thing and it rolls into the fourth quarter and so on. So it\u2019s hard to judge whether that particularly had an effect on sales or not, but that\u2019s the ultimate test. We\u2019re doing it, so sales go up, you know what I mean? We\u2019re convinced though, that, part of this has to do with the products are getting more complex and it takes unless you\u2019re very, very practiced at selling it, it eats up time. And I\u2019ve been saying for a dog\u2019s age, how much the time of a franchisee is a scarce resource, so it bumps up against our selling capacity. Actually, the motion of the market bumps up again and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do, we\u2019re trying to unleash that. But sales are the basis for it. David Leiker : Yes. So this spend I think is predominantly in the U.S. market, right? Nick Pinchuk : Pretty much. Because \u2013 look, despite this U.S. market we think is okay, the other markets are kind of afflicted. David Leiker : Yes. So if you look at the U.S. market, I mean low-single-digits here, I think you might\u2019ve been mid-single-digit the quarter before, does that imply that spend is working the way you want it or are you trying to get sales higher? Nick Pinchuk : We\u2019re trying to get sales higher. Aldo Pagliari : The sales were also low-single-digit in Q2. Nick Pinchuk : Yes. They were low-single-digit, we\u2019re trying to get sales high. That\u2019s true, I mean that\u2019s the whole thing. This is a situation that we believe the market is there. We believe we have the products that can take that market. We see those products having some frictions in the way our business operates in terms of the way they sell. And so we have to make it more efficient, that\u2019s why we\u2019re spending on this. But we\u2019re pretty confident that that\u2019s going to work. And by the way, the franchisees tell us, I just had a franchisee tell me that he got training and then he conducted training for technicians. It\u2019s all about telling the technicians how to wheel these products and he sold a lot of diagnostics. So we hear a lot of windshield surveys about this kind of approach working for us and the training having positive effect. But it hasn\u2019t played out in the numbers yet because I don\u2019t think we saw after the SFC the \u2013 we haven\u2019t got a full results there for the SFC based on calendarization David Leiker : So let me ask you one other piece on the same topic. So the spend isn\u2019t driving the sales, is that because there is a lag between those and we\u2019re still waiting on that? Is that because of what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working, you need to continue to tweak it and find something else? What\u2019s your thought? Nick Pinchuk : No, look, I think we think our \u2013 it\u2019s working better. We will continue to tweak it every quarter, we\u2019ll continue to tweak it, because this kind of thing, you need to keep making it better and better, that\u2019s the thing. But it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t think the current \u2013 we actually were very encouraged by the results \u2013 by the feedback we got after the SFC. But in terms of reporting, we got to see the sales and if we don\u2019t see the sales, we\u2019re start tweaking again and we\u2019ll probably keep tweaking anyway, like we tweaked the Rock \u2018n Roll Cab. All that time it was growing, it wasn\u2019t static. David Leiker : Okay. And then just one other item, although on the working capital you went through some of the comments as it relates sequentially, quarter-to-quarter, if you look at the year-to-date number or even year-over-year, there\u2019s about a $100 million that went into working capital. Some of that\u2019s going to be currency, some of that\u2019s going to be acquisitions. But can you talk about what the pieces of that are and break that a part for us? Aldo Pagliari : Sure. David, actually, you and Nick have been talking about a big piece of it. Actually, if you look at the year-over-year variance, 65% of the increase is attributable to the Snap-On Tools Group. If you look at it in the quarter, 85% of the variance is related to the Snap-On Tools Group. So one thing, we think there is more opportunities to be had. The inventory is there to try to capture those opportunities as they manifest themselves. Second, what makes it \u2013 the order is taken to the SFC, we\u2019re well above the sales that we had in terms of the quarter. So while orders don\u2019t necessarily equals sales, we like having stronger orders coming out of the SFC and that\u2019s why we feel pretty good that the inventory we have built as a home to go to as we roll through the future quarters. David Leiker : Okay. Thanks. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Aldo Pagliari : Hi, Bret. Bret Jordan : Nick, I guess all those questions for you. On corporate expense and obviously controlled number this quarter, should we be thinking about sort of a lower corporate expense over time? I think you used to sort of guide to that and the number was north of 90, but is something structurally going on now? Nick Pinchuk : I think the right ongoing pace of corporate expense, if you look at it runs between $20 million to $23 million per quarter, so we\u2019re under that. I hate to say the reason we\u2019re under it, because variable compensation is down significantly, actually accounts for most of the differential. So obviously, if we start to achieve the type of sales targets and you\u2019ve heard us talk about and operating performance, we would expect that to return to a more normal level. And so I\u2019m not going to give you a quarter-by-quarter estimate. We still hold true to our long-term run rates, that corporate would be in the $90 million to $95 million range would be more appropriate. This year we just hit our own targets. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then on \u2013 question on sort of follow-up question on the inventory, the working capital question. I think in the prepared remarks you talked about it being higher for \u2013 anticipate a critical industry demand, but then on that last response you were talking about a fair amount of the working capital growth being tools related. Do you have visibility on this critical industry ordering that the inventory that you\u2019re building is going to get sold out? Is there sort of a build of inventory in advance of the sale or is this sort of more speculative inventory growth? Nick Pinchuk : Actually, on the critical industry side it\u2019s less speculative, it\u2019s actually more made to order the problem that you have, I guess, you can say it here, the fact that we manage \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a happy problem or a difficult problem, hand tool volume in the Tools Group has never been higher. It\u2019s putting a lot of demand for all the resources that we have in our manufacturing plants that are dedicated to hand tools. In addition, the projects that are very specific that are in the hands of our industrial division that serves a critical industries have a lot of hand tool content. It\u2019s a nature of the timing of how these projects unfold, many times you\u2019ve bid them as much as a year earlier when they\u2019re finally awarded and get funding, sometimes it takes quarters of lag. So what you have is you\u2019ve doubled down on demand at the same time coming out of our hand tool factories. So to answer your question, on the industrial side, it\u2019s not speculative. You can always argue that on the tool side, while we try to control the pace of demand to some extent with our product offerings and our promotions and what we intend to offer, it is a little bit more short-term in that will live hand to mouth in the Tools Group, right, in terms of the order book. On the critical industry side, there is more of a backlog, so we know what our customers want, we have the Tools Group that actually has to supply to both, but the Industrial Group itself doesn\u2019t have factories. The Tools Group is the key supplier to the Industrial Group. Bret Jordan : Yes. Okay. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everyone. Just to hang up on the inventory discussion while we\u2019re on that topic, how does this 2.6 times turnover compared with targeted levels? What is \u2013 how should we be thinking about kind of a normalized number there? Aldo Pagliari : Well, I think the question is more like this, is that, I don\u2019t think, we kind of look at ourselves to make sure that we have the appropriate inventory in place, and it\u2019s not so much a target. I wouldn\u2019t say the target is an independent variable. What we target is the return on net operating assets because one of the situations where we keep expanding our product offerings, so that keeps adding to inventory. Our principal, primary drive is the RONA bit calculation as opposed to the inventory turn calculation. David MacGregor : Okay. Conspicuous \u2013 I guess conspicuous is the absence from the discussion of the Tools segment this quarter was RCI. And I guess the question is do you feel you\u2019ve kind of approached the limits of what\u2019s achievable in the near-term in terms of margin there? Nick Pinchuk : No. I think I said in \u2013 you can\u2019t cover everything in these calls. So I \u2013 the thing is it\u2019s like this is that generally, RCI is operating pretty well, but this is a time of periodic challenge. There are a lot of things going on. For example, you have currency. You have some of these higher costs in investing in the Tools Group. Both of those are in great factor in the Tools Group. On the other end and as well, you do have some material costs floating through. Normally we don\u2019t mention material costs, but they\u2019re not matched with such other challenges. So RCI didn\u2019t really offset those, so we didn\u2019t talk about them. RCI was a counterbalance though to some of them. I mean if you look at the Tools Group, one of the things that\u2019s kind of interesting of the Tools Group, if you look at the gross margin, the gross margin is down 20 basis points, again, 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. So at the gross margin level, you can see, if you just hone in on that, you can see the effects of RCI. David MacGregor : On the operating expenses, I guess you talked about higher field support investments. I guess a question for Aldo, how long will it take these investments to leverage in the margins? Aldo Pagliari : Well, it\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t want to give you a quarter-by-quarter guidance. To kind of indirectly answer this or I directly answered it, I guess, earlier on, we believe in what we\u2019re doing. It doesn\u2019t mean you meet with immediate success. One key differentiator, David, for Snap-on, as you well know, is we\u2019re up close and personal. That\u2019s what we\u2019re all about. That differentiates us from the crowd. In terms of our franchisees, that means to have to be on-site delivering great expertise to help customers solve problems out of the variety of.42,000 SKUs that they represent in the backdrop, which means we have to make sure that our guys are trained to be effective in delivering that message and do it in a very narrow time constant. They only have so many minutes that they can spend. So we find there\u2019s better ways to do it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been embracing. We accentuated that at the SFC, and we are very pleased that we had, I think, well over 1,200 attendees at our \u2013 as an example, our diagnostic training session, which tends to be a complicated product. So we believe the franchisees recognize the importance of ongoing training for themselves and when they have assistance, their teams, and we\u2019re going to continue to reinforce that and we\u2019re not going to abandon our approach to differentiate Snap-on on that basis. So I hope we get the returns very quickly. I can\u2019t guarantee that and we\u2019ll continue to invest in that channel though to make sure that they are par excellence as opposed to the competition. Nick Pinchuk : So we see it as a kind of strategic advantage. One of the things about it, cars are getting more complex. The way to fix them are with these very elaborate products, but the elaborate products cannot actually be effectively wielded without face to face guidance and training and coaching that our franchisees are well positioned to do. The problem is if they\u2019re not really good at it, it\u2019ll eat up a lot of their time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so high on this training and focused on it. Take advantage of that strategic\u2026 David MacGregor : Thanks for that detail. Last question for me is just we keep talking about organic growth in the Tool segment and it\u2019s been a real challenge and frustrating for you, I\u2019m sure. I guess I\u2019m trying to understand some of the structural underpinnings behind the situation. I wonder if you could just talk about the extent to which you feel franchisee attrition is a headwind in achieving that 4% goal. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. A lot of \u2013 there are a lot of ways to think about this. I mean, franchisee attrition can be a headwind. I mean, certainly to the extent you have retirement, where the people who have been in place for a long time, sometimes it\u2019s hard to \u2013 to replace them. So certainly in one point in time if you have more turn-ins, even if you \u2013 and like this quarter, we basically had turn-ins and we didn\u2019t lose any franchisees and we filled up those routes immediately, but there is a startup period. So that\u2019ll set you back a little bit. But on the other hand, in many cases when you put a fresh pair of hands in, an enthusiastic fresh pair of hands that\u2019s starting out, they are smoking and the numbers go up. So I think you kind of balance those two. I\u2019m not sure you can say for sure, it might be a temporal situation for a short period of time, but I kind of think when we replace people it\u2019s okay. David MacGregor : Thanks, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle : Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks very much taking the call. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning, Curt. Curtis Nagle : How are you guys doing? Aldo Pagliari : We\u2019re surviving, buddy. Curtis Nagle : Okay, good. So, yes, just I guess two quick ones on capital. It looks like CapEx, I think kicked up a little bit. Just curious what that\u2019s accounted for. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, new product. I mean, the thing is that we\u2019re expanding products. So you heard, I think we both mentioned that hand tools are pretty strong in the quarter, and so you\u2019re expanding that. And all that new product I went through in my discussion that is often backed up by factory positioning, but particularly the hand tool business, which is very highly integrated. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that a lot. And then also we invest because we turn out so many new products, we tend to invest in the ability to just to design those products and to figure out how we can prototype faster and so on, things like direct laser metal sintering and 3D and so on. And Mitchell 1, we\u2019re expanding in Mitchell 1, we\u2019re putting them in a bigger building because they\u2019re so profitable and has done so well. Mitchell 1 has been \u2013 if you\u2019ve been listening to the calls, have been every quarter doing very well and they\u2019re a high profitability company, so we want to enable them as much as possible. Curtis Nagle : Okay, understood. And then, yes, just kind of on a related topic, in terms of executions for buybacks. Looks like it\u2019s a good bit below last year, at least up through 3Q. So I guess, how should we think about that? Perhaps you\u2019ll have a pickup in 4Q? Or is there something else that\u2019s holding you back at the moment? Aldo Pagliari : Actually, I\u2019ll answer that, Curtis. Actually, it\u2019s a little bit more similar than you realize. If you look back in Q3, there was a lot of share option exercise that occurred in the quarter. So if you look at the net share repurchase, it actually is very similar. It was $58 million this year versus $59.9 million last year. So actually similar in that regard. Having said that, we look at share opportunities in terms of repurchase effort, we look at where the stocks at relative to the market, what is the backdrop, how much volatility is in the marketplace and things of that nature. So it\u2019s hard to say with exactitude what one\u2019s going to buy in any quarter, but it was an opportunity to buy in the quarter and we did. And if you look on a trailing 12-month basis, we\u2019ve been on pace to buy a little over 2% of the outstanding shares of the company. So it\u2019s something that we look at each and every quarter and talk to the Board about what we should devote to this activity and we have authorization to be flexible. So at this point in time we\u2019re in pretty good shape. Curtis Nagle : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : We will take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Yes, good morning. Thanks. Wondering where you might be seeing macro impacts of the well known economic slowdown there \u2013 out there. I know many of your markets sync to their own tune to a little bit of a degree, but you are diversified. So wondering where you\u2019re seeing some of those impacts. Nick Pinchuk : Say that again. Where you\u2019re seeing the impacts of economics on the markets? Christopher Glynn : The slower macro there, with the caveat that I know some of your access to markets operate a little independently of short-term macro fluctuations. Just wondering\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Yes, look, I think, we \u2013 okay, I got it. I think we think the U.S. is pretty good. I think U.S. business is \u2013 if you look at the macros in the U.S. in terms of technician wages, went up 3.6% year-over-year. And the investment \u2013 the nominal investment in the car \u2013 the real investment in the car repair went up 2.5%, so \u2013 and the miles driven went up. So I think that\u2019s pretty positive. And we kind of feel that when we do the windshield surveys out in the marketplace. So we think that\u2019s a good business. I mean, the industrial business in the U.S. was okay for us in the quarter. It again was very good. I think when you talk to people in industrial and the bigger companies, they\u2019re a little more muted in their views of the world, but still we think that\u2019s okay. I think Europe, the UK and Germany were particularly more difficult. I don\u2019t know, I think that\u2019s all Brexit related though. Both of those are related in terms of Brexit. In Asia-Pacific, China is a kind of, I would say squirrely market these days. And it was kind of flattish this quarter, maybe down just a little bit, but you see China having a little bit more difficulties in terms of the \u2013 I suppose in psychology of commercial advancement these days. So I think you see that. I think Australia; we\u2019ve seen Australia coming off the bubble I think commodity related and so on, the latest commodity downturn. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And on the SOT margins\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Christopher Glynn : As it\u2019s been sort of a flattish or below target for some times as just addressed, I\u2019m wondering if that your \u2013 there\u2019s maybe a structural reset in the margins we should anticipate as you kind of create a cost structure to see the next succession of higher organic compounding, and maybe the channel investment you\u2019re putting in now is maybe a step in that direction. Just curious wanted to float that concept by you. Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think, look \u2013 I think, Chris, the gross margins now okay, generally. I mean, there\u2019s a lot of variation. Like I said, those margins has been okay and we\u2019re investing a little bit in the business, and so I do believe we\u2019re going to stay at that level for some time. Even if sales come back, the plan is we\u2019re investing in that, we\u2019re enabling the franchisees and the sales go up. As a percent of sales, they don\u2019t \u2013 you kind of fall away and of course profitability goes up. That\u2019s the idea. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking to \u2013 that is an ad which we\u2019re going to keep for awhile, but we are \u2013 that\u2019s what we think is going to work. Christopher Glynn : So you\u2019re not working out a fundamental resizing of the SG&A side, necessarily? Nick Pinchuk : No, no, no, no, because we think we know the problem. Christopher Glynn : Okay, great. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Stember with CL King. Scott Stember : Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Aldo Pagliari : Hi, Scott. Scott Stember : Aldo, you made a comment about within tools that the hand tool demand was \u2013 has never been higher. Can you maybe just give us some of the sub-segments within Tools how hand tools ditch tool storage, power tools and all that kind of, and diagnostics? Aldo Pagliari : Sure. Hand tools is and has been the biggest category for the Snap-on Tools Group. And again, it\u2019s had a very robust year. By design to some extent, I mean, because we\u2019ve introduced a lot of new products in that area. We\u2019ve put together a lot of nice promotional packages in that area. It\u2019s resonated with the franchisees and seems to be resonating in the uptake of their customer base. So again hand tools has not dissipated whatsoever even with the advent of more complexity in cars. Next important product lines, typically is the tool storage and diagnostics. Tool storage tends to be right up there. And this quarter diagnostics was actually better. Diagnostics did quite well off the Tools Group. And again, you\u2019ve been hearing us talk a little bit about emphasis. So any quarter, Scott, you get variation depending on what the team is emphasizing. In this particular quarter, diagnostics was a little bit more accentuated; training that we\u2019ve talked about already and things of that nature. And power tools is more an issue of timing. Power tools was not as big in the quarter for sales to the Tools Group, but the order book for power tools looks pretty good. And Nick talked that like \u2013 some of the new product features on the half-inch impact and we expect that\u2019s going to have pretty good fourth quarter even though we don\u2019t give guidance kind of in the future quarters. So that\u2019s kind of the lay of the land. Nick Pinchuk : See, the thing about hand tools is it\u2019s been up strong for several quarters. But that\u2019s what leads to the Aldo\u2019s comments that the demand is very, very robust because that\u2019s been pretty steady, higher and higher. It\u2019s going fairly well because of the expansive things like the FDX, the Flank Drive Extra, spreading out over the wrenches, get people to say, oh, I need a new set of wrenches because this is the new wrenching system and it\u2019s much more effective. So they sign up for that. So the hand tool product line has been particularly robust and has resonated with customers and it\u2019s been for several quarters. That\u2019s what leads to the question of the factories. Scott Stember : Yes. And just \u2013 could you just give us some commentary up mid singles, high singles and maybe for a couple of the other sub-segments as well, some actual numbers? Aldo Pagliari : You\u2019re talking about Tools Group or the other groups now? Scott Stember : Yes, within Tools Group, maybe how the hand tool was up mid singles, high singles? Aldo Pagliari : Our hand tools was up mid-single digits and diagnostics is up strong, even stronger than that. Power tools as I said, it was down for them in the quarter and tool storage was more reflective of timing down a bit, but again, the order book for tool storage looked pretty good at the show. So again, orders don\u2019t necessarily equal sales, but a nice order book coming out of the SFC related to tool storage. Nick Pinchuk : And in the third quarter, the general view was more or less what happens in the orders out of the SFC. And generally, they were mostly \u2013 in fact, I think they were, all those categories we talked about were up mid \u2013 lower mid-single digits. So it came out relatively strong. I think the SFC itself was up mid-single digit. Scott Stember : All right. And within RS&I, could you maybe just quantify how sales work in your company versus outside of the Tool Group, meaning to outside whether it was a dealerships, just quantify what the numbers were? Nick Pinchuk : Wow. I think that the intercompany sales is principally the sales of diagnostics. There\u2019s some equipment that sells through there too. I think the diagnostics were up reasonably strong in the quarter, reasonably strong in the quarter. They get sold not exclusively, but principally to the Tools Group and they were up I think mid-single digits in a quarter, so we had that. And then, Aldo already told you that the sales by the Tools Group was positive, so that\u2019s a nice balance. And then equipment I think was flat to down, a little bit down in the quarter for the Tools Group. And those were the primary intercompany sales. The rest of the stuff, like I said, you had actually, the way you think about RS&I is, is the sales to the OEM businesses generally tends to be a little bit low margin \u2013 little lower margin, lower SG&A. That was up about double digits I think really well. The sales to the independent repair shops with the software diagnostics were also up mid single-digit. So \u2013 and the equipment business was down a little bit driven by weakness in Europe. Scott Stember : Got it. And lastly on FX, last quarter, last couple of quarters you gave \u2013 the earnings impact was to the bottom line. What was it this quarter? And also \u2013 go ahead, I\u2019m sorry. Nick Pinchuk : It was about $0.06. Aldo Pagliari : Yes. Previous quarter, Scott, it was $0.08 of bad news. This quarter it got a little better at $0.06 and I expect that trend is kind of what I\u2019d look at in Q4. Again, currencies never stay where they\u2019re at. But if they do, it\u2019ll be slightly less headwind than the bottom line and Q4 currencies stay where they\u2019re at the end of the quarter here. Scott Stember : Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks, again. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. Operator : And with no additional questions, I would like to turn the call back to Sara Verbsky, for any additional or closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.

The comparative results for the quarter and the full year each include special non-recurring events that affected our as reported levels. So to provide greater clarity, as we have in the past, we\u2019ll refer to the amount excluding the one-time effect as an as adjusted number to make everything comparable. And when you look through it all, similar to the third quarter, Snap-on did see external headwinds in a number of areas. But we met those challenges and moved forward. We did have disparities from group to group and within each group, but overall we're encouraged by our position and our possibilities. The fourth quarter demonstrated elements of progress that were somewhat attenuated by economic turbulence and challenged geographies and by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency. As in the recent past, we show progress in the U.S. with growth across most of our operations in that area. So volume in the U.S. continued it\u2019s upward trajectory, but our operations in Europe, they show countervailing weakness in several major countries. And as I said, there was also a meaningful impact from currency translation and transactions. So we had significant headwinds. But once again, I think our advantages prevailed. Organic sales were up 0.6%, sales gains in critical industries and repair information and independent \u2013 and equipment for independent repair shop owners and managers and continued growth at the U.S. van channel. We had advancements in power tools and tool storage and customized tool sets. It all combined to circumnavigate the variations and move us forward overall. Opco operating income before financial services of $171.4 million, including unfavorable foreign currency compared to $182.1 million in 2018, which included a $4.3 million one-time benefit from the settlement of an employee-related litigation matter. Excluding that legal matter, fourth quarter as adjusted OI was $177.8 million. Now RCI was evident in the quarter, but it wasn't able to offset the negative foreign currency and the economic weakness of Europe. For financial services operating income of $62.2 million was an increase from last year\u2019s $56.1 million. That results combined with Opco for a consolidated overall operating margin of 22.5% compared with 23% last year or 22.6%, 22.5% this year compared to the 22.6% as adjusted, excluding the legal benefit last year. Our quarterly EPS of $3.08 was above the 2018 as adjusted EPS of $3.03. As reported Q4 2018 EPS including the one-time legal matter was $3.09. So those are the numbers in general. Let's speak about the markets. We believe the automotive repair environment continues to be generally favorable. Having said that, in the areas serving vehicle OEMs and dealerships, we have seen some pause, lower new car sales in the years did impact dealer buying habits and the number of projects continued commissioned by the vehicle OEMs decreased. For independent repair shops, however, the things look different. Based on what we've heard \u2013 what we're hearing from franchisees, from technicians, from shop owners, the optimism in the independent repair shops is strong and unaffected by new car sales. And our sales in that sector in the U.S. have been positive and they continue to be so. So we believe vehicle repair remains a favorable place to operate. But the critical industries we're seeing progress, strong activity in the U.S. aerospace, military, heavy duty sectors, somewhat offset by softness in the international area, centered on general industry and international aerospace. But our overall activity trend continues to look quite promising and the trajectory of our critical industry business is clearly positive. Our Industrial division demonstrated the opportunities in critical industries. Overcoming the headwinds of Brexit and the general softness in Europe, registering gains driven by it's customized product kits, matching the product to the task. We do believe we're well positioned to confront the challenges of this particular period, making progress along our runways for growth, despite the turbulence. We also have competence that we have continuing potential in our runways for improvement. The Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. There are constant fuel for our progress, especially customer connection. Understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology. We believe our product lineup is getting stronger every day and we keep investing to make it so. You see, vehicles are getting more complex, technicians need assistance and so our products are getting more sophisticated to match the rising requirements. And Snap-on products are keeping pace. And our franchisees and our direct sales force, face to face with technicians are in the perfect position for showcasing our powerful new offerings and for demonstrating their use right in the workplace. It's a great opportunity in the changing environment of today and we're working hard to take full advantage. So across the corporation, I would characterize our markets as mixed positive with significant potential yet turbulent from period to period and place to place. Now for the full year, sales up $3.73 billion represented an organic increase of 1.2%, a similar story to the quarter, growth in the U.S. buffeted by Europe. The U.S. franchise is arising, particularly turbulence in the UK van channel, critical industries growing against the wind and strength with independent repair shop owners and managers balancing the shortfall in OEM dealerships. As reported, Opco OI margin for the year was 19.2% compared with last years 19.4%, excluding the one-time benefits in both years, the full year as adjusted Opco OI margin was 18.9%, including 20 basis points of foreign currency drag compared with the as adjusted 19.3% in 2018. And when we include the operating income from financial services, the $245.9 million, which rose $15.8 million, the consolidated operating overall margin for the corporation was 23.7% or as adjusted 23.4% flat with last years as adjusted level. So reported earnings per share for the year was $12.41, up 4.5%. And excluding the non-recurring events, the EPS was $12.26, up $0.45 or 3.8% compared to last years as adjusted number. So those are the numbers. Now let's talk about the individual operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter reported sales for the group including $900,000 of acquisition related volume and $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency grew $9.2 million or 2.7%. Organic sales for the group increased $11.8 million or 3.5%. The period saw strong performance from our Power Tools division up double-digits, affirming that our innovative new product tools are resonating with automotive technicians. Beyond that, the Industrial division registered low-single digit growth with mixed results across the industries and geographies. As I said, military was strong and U.S. and aerospace, heavy duty also rose overcoming decline in the international sector. For the first time in a while, a long time actually, volume for SNA Europe, our European-based hand tool business was off in the quarter, driven by weakness in several major arenas, including Germany, the Nordic countries and France. C&I\u2019s operating margin was $45 million, down $5.8 million, including $0.6 million of unfavorable currency. That reflected primarily the industrial gains being more weighted towards the lower military sector, diluting the group's operating income down to 12.8% compared to the 14.8% recorded last year, when there was a more typical balance of customers. I mentioned earlier that our power tools operation registered a strong quarter, sales were up double-digits. Well that gain was on the strength of our new cordless products. Products like the new 14.4 volt, CTR762 3/8 inch Ratchet, we call it the Brute. As the name would imply, it was designed specifically for automotive jobs that require substantial muscle, tasks like exhaust manifold removal, brake caliber replacement and general suspension work. The CTR762 Ratchet combines thematic-like power, 70 pound feet of torque output with the convenience of a cordless platform and the Ratchet mechanism, the head and the neck are strong, robust enough to handle even more force 158 pound feet of manual torque. It is a Brute and the technicians recognize it. The new Ratchet also has a variable speed trigger for improved control and it can reach 175 RPM free speed. That means quick fastener removal. So launched on October and it's been well received and it's easily one of our hit million dollar products. Also in C&I, our torque product line is making great strides. Like we said, it was driven in part by a widening array of new offerings for customers and critical industries like our new powerful 18 volt cordless EvoTorque line, designed for railroads and wind turbans and natural resources and other critical industries where remote repair and maintenance is a norm. EvoTorque covers a torque range of 150 pound feet to 4,000 pound feet and it comes in six basic models, three single speed and three auto two speed. And adding significantly, it's the result of the synergies made possible by Norbar's recent additions to the Snap-on family. The Evo's innovative design, what makes its power, is the combination of a powerful and robust Norbar gearbox and a Norbar beam transducer with an organized handle -- with an ergonomic handle and an 18-volt battery platform from our Snap-on power tools division. The result is a torque wrench that's compact, portable and accurate, plus or minus 3%, while similar tools are much less precise, generally within plus or minus 5%. Industry feedback has been quite positive, and the sales are pretty brisk. Now let's turn to the industrial division, focused on critical industries outside the vehicle garage. Gains now accomplished for 13 straight quarters despite a weakening in Europe. And the ongoing positive trend has been driven by customer connection, extending our understanding of critical work, and that progress can be measured in a number of new tool solutions we offer each year. Well, last year, we added almost 5,700 new products. It's a critical -- it's our -- it's critical to our industry -- critical industry lineup. That's quite a few products, 5,700. It's a design and logistics challenge to be sure but it's a large advantage with critical industry customers. We're rolling the Snap-on brand out of the garage with increasing strength. Critical industries is a great opportunity, and we're addressing the possibilities with new products aimed at solving the tasks of consequence that inhabit that critical arena. Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales are up 1.3%, with continued growth in the U.S. operation, up low single digits, a positive that was again, this quarter, offset by a decline in international operations, principally in the UK. Operating income in the quarter was $54.3 million and compares to $57 million in 2018. The OI margin was 13.2%, an 80 basis point decrease, including 40 basis points of unfavorable currency, the turbulence in the UK and the investments we're making in training and field support to expand franchisee selling capacity to match the demands of our more sophisticated products and to capture the opportunity in the changing repair environment. In the quarter and throughout the year, the Tools Group did confirm the underlying market-leading position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger. That's clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. They continue to trend favorably, and that positivity was acknowledged by multiple publications all listing Snap-on as a franchisee -- franchise of choice. This quarter, Snap-on was once again ranked among the top franchise organizations, both in the U.S. and abroad. We were again recognized by the Franchise Business Review, which, in its latest ranking for franchisee satisfaction, listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the 13th consecutive year we've received that award. We were also ranked number two among all franchises in Entrepreneur Magazine's 2019 list of Top Franchises for our Veterans. And abroad, Snap-on was ranked number one in Elite Franchise Magazine's top UK franchises, rising three spots from last year and finishing above many well-known international brands in the publication's largest-ever competition. So despite the difficulties in the UK economy, our franchise remains very positively regarded. To me, that's good news for the future. Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and of our van business in general and would not have been possible, it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products developed through our strong customer connection, leading to customer connection, leading to a multiple -- to multiple new innovations as a result of our insight and experience in a changing vehicle repair environment. One of the latest additions to our lineup, an example of this is our Milwaukee-manufactured GM head bolt socket developed from connections with a loyal Snap-on technician. The 0.5-inch drive 13 millimeter socket enables efficient head bolt removal and installation on General Motors' light truck gen-5 V8 engines. The socket special drive design summons the torque necessary to break free even heavily corroded head bolts, and the 4-inch socket height allows technicians to clear the rocker arms in the GM engine design, making repairs easy, even in the difficult GM V8 engine compartment and believe -- another great example of customer connection. And believe me, just as another subject, and believe me, we're working hard to strengthen our tool storage lineup. The effort is \u2013 and the effort is bearing fruit. Tool storage is up in the quarter and up in the year. We recently add the KRSC430A professional grade shop cart to add \u2013 to our lineup on mobile tool solutions. It\u2019s a new 40-inch cart that makes it easy to move even very heavy tools from bay-to-bay and it offers a sliding split top \u2013 split lid, which allows quick access to frequently used tools, manufactured in our Algona, Iowa plant, right in the heartland. The heavy-duty cart body is entirely welded with a double-wall design for lasting strength. It also features interchangeable doors, customization to fit any job. The initial launch went quite well, and it\u2019s clear the new cart will be another one of our hit products. Well, that\u2019s the Tools Group, expanding its success in the U.S., balancing the international operations, continuing to develop innovative new product, building underlying strength. Now RS&I, volume in the fourth quarter was $335 million. That\u2019s down organically, 1.5% with gains in sales of undercar equipment and diagnostics and repair information products being more than offset by decreases in the business focused on vehicle OEMs and dealerships. It was another turbulent period for that lumpy project-driven OEM sector. RS&I operating earnings in the quarter were $87.2 million, down $200,000 from last year, including $200,000 of unfavorable foreign currency. OI margin for the group was a strong 26%, up 30 basis points from last year\u2019s level and with basically driven by growth in information products, growth in information products paving the way to that 26%. Along those lines, in terms of innovation products, our Mitchell 1 division which provides the software independent shops continues to succeed pursuing customer connection and innovation, bringing great new products to improve shop efficiency. We just launched \u2013 our Mitchell 1 just launched. Our new online appointment scheduling capability, in addition to our already extensive repair shop management software, vehicle owners can now request an appointment with just a few clicks on the shop\u2019s website automatically alerting garage schedulers of their request. It\u2019s a great efficiency tool. As part of our Mitchell 1 shop management for independent garages. And it\u2019s another example about how Snap-on value creation is authoring the continuing upward trend at Mitchell 1. Speaking of Mitchell 1, we just opened a new facility for that information business and enhanced operating and design environment. We\u2019re investing in Mitchell 1 and we expect more success. RS&I also launched in the quarter. Our new PRO-LINK Edge heavy-duty \u2013 it\u2019s a heavy-duty diagnostic handheld, a bigger screen, easier to use interface, faster vehicle connection time, updated software and increased vehicle coverage. Snap-on is already the leader in heavy-duty diagnostics. The PRO-LINK Edge will expand that advantage. It was just introduced at the end of the year and so far it\u2019s looking good. We keep driving to expand RS&I\u2019s position with repair shop owners and managers, offering more new products to sell developed by value creations process that are added by our strategic and coherent acquisitions and we\u2019re confident that\u2019s a winning formula. Well that\u2019s our fourth quarter. Arena\u2019s \u2013 areas of both challenge and advancement. We believe, we leave the year stronger than when we entered. And in the end, an EPS for the quarter of $3.08 up from the as adjusted $3.03 from last year and for the full year, as adjusted EPS at $12.26 rising from the as adjusted $11.81 overall progress, hard one against turbulence. Now I turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $955.2 million in the quarter were up 0.3%, reflecting a six tenths of 1% organic sales gain, $3.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $6.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflected low single-digit growth in both the Snap-on Tools and Commercial & Industrial segments, partially offset by a low single digit decline in the Repair Systems & Information group. Similar to the trends, we experienced in Q3 of 2019 overall, on a year-over-year basis, sales to customers in the United States increased, while sales in Europe continued to exhibit weakness. Consolidated gross margin of 47.2% compared to 48% last year. The 80 basis point decrease primarily reflects increased sales and lower gross margin businesses, 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 29.3% increased 40 basis points from 28.9% last year. Q4 of 2018 included a $4.3 million or 40 basis point benefit associated with the legal settlement that Nick mentioned earlier. Operating earnings before financial services of $171.4 million, including $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $182.1 million in 2018, or $177.8 million as adjusted for the legal settlement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 17.9% of sales, compared to 19.1% last year or 18.7% as adjusted. Financial services revenue of $83.9 million and operating earnings of $62.2 million increased 1.5% and 10.9% respectively from 2018, primarily reflecting year-over-year growth in our financial services portfolio and improved portfolio performance resulting in lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $233.6 million, including $2.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $238.2 million last year, or $233.9 million as adjusted. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings of 22.5% compares to 23% last year, versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter as adjusted operating earnings margin of 22.6%, which reflected a 40 basis point benefit in the legal settlement. This year\u2019s operating margin was lower by 10 basis points. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22.3% compared to 22% last year. Finally, net earnings of $170.6 million or $3.08 per share, including a $0.04 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency, compared to $175 million or $3.09 per share a year ago. In 2018, excluding a $0.06 per share benefit from the legal settlement, adjusted earnings were $3.03. For the full year 2019, fully diluted earnings per share of $12.41 increased 4.5% over $11.87 per share as reported last year. Now let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $352.9 million in the quarter, increased 2.7%, reflecting a 3.5% organic sales gain and $9.9 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth included a double-digit gain in our power tools business, a mid-single-digit increase in our Asia Pacific operations, and a low-single-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, particularly sales to the U.S. military. These increases were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our European-based hand tools business.  Gross margin of 35.5% decreased 300 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and lower gross margin businesses, including sales to the military. Sales in the fourth quarter to the military were up significantly both year-over-year and sequentially. The operating expense margin of 22.7% improved 100 basis points from 23.7% last year, primarily due to higher volumes and lower expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $45 million, decreased $5.8 million from last year and the operating margin of 12.8% compared to 14.8% in 2018. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $411.7 million increased 1.1%, reflecting a 1.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes a low-single-digit gain in our U.S. franchise operations, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline internationally. Gross margin of 40.2%, including 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects remained unchanged from last year. The operating expense margin of 27% increase from 26.2% last year, primarily due to higher field support investments. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $54.3 million, including $1.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, decreased the $2.7 million from last year, while the operating margin of 13.2% including 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 14% in 2018. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $335 million decreased 1.4%, reflecting a 1.5% organic sales decline and $2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $2.6 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic decrease includes a high single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships through our equipment solutions business, partially offset by low-single-digit gains in both sales of undercar equipment and sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 47.7% increased 20 basis points from 47.5% last year, while the operating expense margin of 21.7% improved 10 basis points from 21.8% in 2018. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $87.2 million, compared to $87.4 million a year ago, and the operating margin of 26% increased at 30 basis points from 25.7% last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Operating earnings from financial services of $62.2 million increased 10.9% versus the fourth quarter of 2018. Revenue of $83.9 million was up 1.5% from a year ago. Financial services expenses of $21.7 million decreased $4.9 million from last year\u2019s levels, primarily due to decreases in the provision for credit losses, reflecting improved portfolio performance as well as lower variable compensation and other costs. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1% and 1.3% in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018 respectively. The average yield on finance receivables in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 17.5% compared to 17.7% last year. Principally, reflective of the credit quality of customers originating loans over the past several months. The respect of average yield on contract receivables was 9.2% in both periods. Total loan originations of $262.4 million, decreased $4.7 million or 1.8%, primarily due to a 3.7% decrease in originations of finance receivables, partially offset by higher originations of contract receivables, principally franchise finance. Moving to Slide 11 \u2013 year-over-year \u2013 our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.86 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio grew $24.3 million in the fourth quarter. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for U.S. extended credit remains stable and reflects the seasonal increase we typically experienced in the fourth quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio trailing 12-month net losses of $49.4 million represented 2.91% of outstandings at year end, down 6 basis points sequentially, supporting continued stabilization in the portfolio\u2019s credit metric performance. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $196.7 million in the quarter, decreased $19.2 million from comparable 2018 levels, primarily due to increases in working investment and cash paid for taxes. Net cash used by investing activities of $41.4 million included net additions to finance receivables of $24.6 million and capital expenditures of $21.6 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $139.2 million, included cash dividends of $59 million and the repurchase of 435,000 shares of common stock for $71.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. Full year 2019 share repurchases totaled 1,495,000 shares for $238.4 million. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $359.6 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables increased $2 million from 2018 year-end. Day sales outstanding of 67 days were unchanged from 2018 year-end. Inventories increased $86.6 million from 2018 year-end, primarily to support the introduction of new products, higher levels of demand across critical industries, including demand for U.S. manufactured hand tools, as well as to improve service levels to our customers. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.9 at year-end 2018. Our year-end cash position of $184.5 million increased $43.6 million from 2018 year-end levels. Our net debt to capital ratio decreased to 22.1% from 24.2% at year-end 2018. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of year-end, we had $193.6 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I\u2019ll briefly look at a few outlook items for 2020. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate that our full year 2020 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Snap-on fourth quarter. Near-term uncertainties, unfavorable foreign exchange, a downdraft in Europe, in particular, Brexit difficulties in the UK, but progress against those headwinds, significant progress. Overall advancement hard won against the headwinds. Opco organic sales up 0.6%, OI margin of 17.9%, down 80 basis points from a 2018 as adjusted result impacted by the mix of critical industry sales being more weighted to the lower margin military sector by unfavorable currency and by spending to enhance the franchise network. Overall advances, continuing strength in RS&I and the repair information business, 26% margin. Favorable trends in the industrial business, gains in the U.S. van channel, and there were significant strides in strengthening our product line across the organization, more customization, more sophistication to match the opportunities of the changing repair environment. And a finance company recording gains in the NOI, which combined with opco to reach an OI margin of 22.5% in the quarter compared with an as adjusted 22.6% of last year. EPS for the quarter at $3.08, above the as adjusted $3.03 recorded last year. Overall, we believe firmly that our business is strong, and we\u2019re confident that going forward, we have the opportunity, the position, the product and the team to confront the headwinds and continue on our positive trajectory through 2020 and beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019ll speak directly to our associates and franchisees. I know many of you are listening. To the entire Snap-on team, we recognize the results of the quarter and of the year are authored by your individual and collective efforts. For your dedication to our progress and for your commitment to our corporation, you have my thanks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Curtis Nagle with Merrill Lynch. Curtis Nagle : Good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions. So I guess, first, Nick, a question for you. How would you describe, I guess, the operating environment of tools this year versus last in terms of things like relative competition, underlying fundamentals, product rollout for you guys? Would you expect organic growth to be higher, kind of stay the same? And that optimism that you\u2019d mentioned in the call, would you say that\u2019s perhaps higher than, say, a year ago? Nick Pinchuk : I would say so. I think, look, I believe I said it right at the beginning. I believe we leave 2019 stronger than we entered. Our product line is stronger than ever. We are seeing progress in the \u2013 not as fast as maybe we would like in the U.S. van channel but it is moving upwards. This was a stronger quarter than in the past on a year-over-year basis. And so we feel pretty positive about that. I think when we talk to our franchisees, we understand, and the technicians, we understand our underlying strength. The simple point is, can we arm our franchisees with enough efficiency to wield the complex products, the sophisticated products to sell in the environment they are as opposed to being capacity bound or time bound? I\u2019ve talked about the time-bound nature of the van business for a long time. That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing in it, and we\u2019re starting to see the results. Against that though, we see turbulence in the UK. The UK was actually a little worse this quarter. On the other hand, Brexit did get signed, and so therefore, without any inside information about the time line, that should make it better going forward. So I feel okay about that. Curtis Nagle : Great, fair and sure. And then a quick follow-up, I guess, for Aldo. How should we think about the balance of product and customer mix in 2020 in C&I in terms of how this could impact the gross margin? Perhaps we see continued pressure because military seems to be doing well, maybe that\u2019s a one-off. Could that reserve \u2013 reverse in terms of that mix impact to gross margin? Aldo Pagliari : Well, the military, Curt, I\u2019d say, in the quarter was probably the highest sales of one particular job in the military that we\u2019ve talked about before. You call it the GMTK, the general mechanics toolkit, so actually, it was up at a double digit in year-over-year comparison as well as sequentially as I mentioned. It will be a significant contributor in Q1, however, not probably to the same level as it was in Q4. And on top of it, what was lacking in Q4 were some of our international sales in the critical industries. They tend to be pretty good margin contributors so if they come back to what I call more normal levels, you get a little bit more cover and get a more traditional gross margin mix. So we welcome the sales to the military, don\u2019t get me wrong. And they\u2019ll move forward over time, but they should have less of a mix effect as you get a little bit more normalized impact in the overall critical industries. Curtis Nagle : Okay. Fair and sure. Thanks very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thank you, good morning. I had a question about the Snap-on Tools margin and the seasonality. You used to see that always ramp 3Q into 4Q, and last year\u2019s assumed anomaly at the time but that repeated this year into the seasonal volume ramp. So wondering what\u2019s changed there. Is this a new dynamic with kind of sequential gross margin pressure, 3Q to 4Q for SOT? Nick Pinchuk : Actually, it may be a new dynamic for us. It wasn\u2019t just last year. I think there have been two years of this kind of move downwards. Some of that may be driven by, we have robust Christmas promotions, and they \u2013 sometimes, they tend to be a little bit lower margin. I think the thing that you might ask, okay, it\u2019s 40%. The gross margin was 40%. 40.2% was flat with last year, and last year, we had significant discounting associated with the Diagnostics business. You might be asking \u2013 well, you might ask, why isn\u2019t that up? And I think the story is this. Last year, we had that discounting. We had some effect of currency but not as much, and we had some small effect \u2013 some effect of the UK. This year, we got 40 basis points of currency and 20 basis points of the UK effect, and so you put those in and you end up having 60 negative. And so we had margin improvement actually year-over-year in the quarter. It\u2019s just that higher currency impacts in the quarter associated with the Tools Group transaction effect and the UK still being a problem for us. So they overcame that and flattened the gross margin. Christopher Glynn : Okay. But taking this year in isolation, what caused the decline sequentially? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think we\u2019ve seen generally a decline sequentially. And what has happened in the decline, what drives the decline, we\u2019re seeing more and more of this is our factories tend to be seeing it like, for example, when you roll into the fourth quarter, especially if \u2013 as the hand tool business has risen and become a higher portion of our product, the factories, which is the most integrated product in the United States, you see things like over Thanksgiving and over Christmas, you see the effects, those expanded hand tool factories, the effects of those weighing a little bit more than the third quarter in terms of the days off they have. So you have worse absorption in this quarter. Fundamentally, your sales are going up, but your absorption is going down because of the days worked. That\u2019s, I think, what we\u2019ve seen. If you go back two quarters, when we didn\u2019t have this discounting and this legacy sales in the fourth quarter that was really the effect. And I think we\u2019re going to see that going forward in this kind of calendarization. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And just wondering if \u2013 looking at the inventory increase and the lower turns, wondering if there was any reserving in the quarter for excess or obsolete inventory or if possibly, that\u2019s something that might be an outcropping of the higher inventory levels at some point? Aldo Pagliari : I don\u2019t think anything more than normal, Chris, this is Aldo. The nature of our inventory is such that when you get the lower market cost or market criteria, we feel pretty good about where our levels of scalability are at. I think the biggest increase in inventory actually is new product introduction. And the take-up pace was not as rigorous as we would like for that, and we\u2019re confident looking to the future. But as you know, we keep targeting a higher level of sales growth. And when we don\u2019t achieve it, the product is there and available but it\u2019s in inventory rather than in the sales line. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then last one for me. The CFO was down a bit year-over-year from very high levels last year with a fair amount of inventory pressure. Just wondering if that\u2019s a good setup for pretty strong CFO growth in 2020 that we could expect. Aldo Pagliari : Well, certainly, I see there\u2019s no reason that inventory has to grow to the same degree it did in 2019. We try to take a measured look at that. Some unique characteristics in 2019 were that we have more sophisticated kits among our critical industries customers. As I said, we had a heavy dose of new product introductions. We\u2019ll have elements of that in 2020, but as you\u2019re suggesting, there\u2019s no reason that the increase in inventory has to be to the same magnitude as what we saw in 2019. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thanks, Aldo. Operator : We will take our next question from David Leiker with Baird. And David, your line is open. Please check your mute button. Hearing no response from David, we will move to Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Could you talk a little bit about diagnostics in the U.S. van channel? I know you guys were doing some educational work at the franchise event back in August. And maybe an update as to how we\u2019re doing with ZEUS and Apollo. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. I can give you versions of that. The \u2013 we had strong \u2013 we\u2019ve had \u2013 we continue to train the people and we\u2019re working with our field force, our diagnostic sales developers and the techno vans and so on, the field source to try to, just as you say, try to expand the capabilities associated with that. We had a \u2013 it was up double digits and it was up very strongly in the third quarter. Diagnostics was down in the fourth quarter, selling to the franchisees, but the movement from the franchisees to the end user kind of followed more traditional paths. So I would figure that the \u2013 if you step back and you look at it and you say, okay, up in the third quarter, kind of down in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s kind of a continuing the same level as before. So therefore, we would say we have more work to do in trying to get our franchisees to understand how to sell this product. It\u2019s kind of moved forward. And ZEUS had a good quarter, by the way, so that was an encouraging data point for us. So with the ZEUS good quarter, we feel that there is some progress because that\u2019s the most difficult thing to sell. So now we\u2019re going to have to make sure we work on Apollo and TRITON to get those stronger. And so I suppose one of the lessons we get out of this is we may have cracked some of the case for ZEUS but we need to do a little bit more on of Apollo and TRITON. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then on the UK, you talked about it being turbulent but may be getting better with Brexit. Is there any change in the van count over there, given the challenges that those distributors are seeing? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, there has been a change, but not \u2013 it\u2019s very small actually. It moves up and down. I think in the middle of the downturn, it was down a little bit but would bounce right back up. So I would say not more than ordinary motion really. It hasn\u2019t really changed that much. I mean, the UK has been a headache for us really, and it punches above its weight in terms of \u2013 on the margins of our performance. But we\u2019re working hard to try to get it under control. We\u2019re working with the products. We\u2019re trying to train the franchisees so they can make the most of things. Generally, it\u2019s short payback items they\u2019re selling. It\u2019s the big payback items that tend to come down in uncertainty. With Brexit being signed, I don\u2019t know. But I think as people understand what\u2019s going to happen in post-Brexit, the certainty returns and the automotive repair market snaps back in the UK. I pretty much believe that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to play out. We\u2019re just happy that they signed Brexit on January 31. Bret Jordan : Yes. And Aldo, one question, I guess, around the credit book. Are the loan terms, as the credit quality is going up and obviously reflected in lower rates, are you seeing shorter loan terms as well? Aldo Pagliari : No. With the \u2013 generally speaking, with the higher price point of products, generally speaking across the board, the franchisees elect up to five-year terms. And I don\u2019t see that \u2013 that actually has trended slightly upward. The migration has been more to a little bit north of four years is the average in the overall portfolio. So I haven\u2019t seen really much of a change in that. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David Leiker with Baird. David Leiker : Good morning, can you hear me? Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, we can hear you, yes. David Leiker : Let\u2019s just chuck that one up to user air. Two things. If we look at the Snap-on tools field support spending, I think we\u2019re probably on two full years of that right now. Is that fair? Nick Pinchuk : No, I don\u2019t think so. I think we started it maybe in the fourth quarter of last year. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s two full years actually. That\u2019s my memory about it, yes. And we\u2019ve kind of ramped it up here. So\u2026 David Leiker : So how do you \u2013 can you talk a little bit about how you determine, calculate if that\u2019s working and driving incremental returns of kind of return on investment or some kind of metrics of how do you gauge the success and executing and delivering on that? Nick Pinchuk : Well, there\u2019s \u2013 I think there are twin axes on this, David. I think one is the overall \u2013 we\u2019re focused on the U.S. really, of course. And this \u2013 I think we made that clear. There\u2019s a separate effort going on to remediate in the UK. I think our number one effort is what happens with sales in the U.S. van channel and it\u2019s been moving upwards. So this quarter was better than the last in terms of a year-over-year basis. So we can feel it moving upwards, maybe not as fast as everybody would like and maybe not as fast as we would like, but that\u2019s an indication that we\u2019re moving the boulder upwards. We\u2019re expanding the capacity to sell. And that\u2019s one issue. Then there are the local issues, just like question recently, if we\u2019re focused on diagnostics, what happens with the individual diagnostic platforms? Because after all, this training gets done platform by platform by platform by platform, and types of customer by types of customer and types of customers. So we kind of segment it that way, platforms by customer. And so the success in those nodules or how we evaluate it. And it\u2019s not just training. It\u2019s also things like we\u2019re adding a new set of vans, we call the Total Shop Solutions. We\u2019ve been expanding and we were at nine last quarter and 15 this quarter, not associated with diagnostics, but this is associated with other more longer payback sales like hand-spin tire balancers and diagnostic workstations, which include full storage box and so on. So we evaluate how those things are occurring in each of the territories. So I think I\u2019ve said for a long time that one of the boundaries of the tools \u2013 the van business is the time and so what we\u2019re doing is trying to make the time more effective. Best thing is the sales. You figure that happens. If the sales goes up, that\u2019s the best thing to do. But we also have a sub-analysis. So that\u2019s how we do it. And we think it\u2019s working. I sure like to see it work faster, but we believe it\u2019s a way forward because we \u2013 go ahead, sorry. David Leiker : Well, as I say, so if you look at that in terms of the absolute spend versus the driving through of revenues, is there a point \u2013 where is the breakpoint where you get revenues growing faster than the spend in that? And is there a point in time that, that spend actually can come back down at all? So how do you see that playing out? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look, I see it playing out. When we start to get up around our target, we start to experiment about cutting back. I think the way the world works for us, and it\u2019s always worked this way, is we spend to capture sales growth. And then as we establish ourselves in that sales growth level and that sales growth level is defined by capacity, the capacity of the franchisees to sell, once we hit that, we try to improve and become more efficient in supporting that behind that wave of capture. So once we get to like x percent growth, we say, \"Okay, we\u2019re there. That\u2019s our level.\" We kind of try to figure out how to do it more efficient. So we\u2019d like to be in the territory where we feel comfortable that that\u2019s an acceptable growth that\u2019s commensurate with the market, with the opportunities. Once we do that, we bring it back. David Leiker : So with that running at low single digits in the U.S., you\u2019re getting close to that growth metric then? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, but not as close as I\u2019d like. Yes, close, closer. Yes, yes, yes. Yes, that\u2019s true. Yes, it\u2019s hard but that\u2019s our method, David. We capture territory and then we make it more efficient. David Leiker : And then just one item for you, Aldo. You didn\u2019t mention it and we\u2019ve had some conversations on this, but is there any update on the bad debt provision, the change in accounting there? Any framework you can give us to have a sense of what that\u2019s going to mean when you adopt it in Q1? Aldo Pagliari : Well, I\u2019ll say this, the official and final reporting of that will be in our K, which is not so far away. I mean, we plan on releasing our K at the \u2013 before the end of next week, actually. So I\u2019ll leave that out there as a statement. But I\u2019ll say this, the workaround, it\u2019s been fairly intense and well done. And I\u2019m pleased with the energy we put into it so far. And you\u2019re talking about CECL. For others on the call, it\u2019s a reference to the adoption of CECL, which becomes effective for the corporation in January of 2020. So in essence, the true reporting of it occurs at the end of the quarter, actually. But I\u2019ll say this, is that right now, David, I\u2019m expecting that our overall adjustment will be something less than $10 million will be that order of magnitude. But the final number will be solidified within about a week. David Leiker : Okay. Great. Thank you much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Stember with CL King. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Scott Stember : Could you guys give a little bit more color on some of the other areas within tools as far as growth, like power tools and hand tools? Nick Pinchuk : Sure, sure. This quarter, hand tools was down some, power tools up double digits. So like I said, power tools had a terrific quarter. And principally, tool storage up, diagnostics down some. So by the way, I encourage people not to get too overheated about these quarterly numbers because they move up and down, depending on what happened last quarter and what \u2013 when the new products hit. For example, power tools is strong this quarter because we have a great new product and everybody has been waiting for it. And so it rolls out. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why it\u2019s strong now. Because remember, our view of the world is the franchisees are capacity limited. We\u2019re building up. That\u2019s why the franchise business in the U.S. is growing again. But it\u2019s kind of a \u2013 you get a new product, it tends to squeeze out some of the other products. But that\u2019s the rollout. Hand tools\u2019 down this quarter after up for the year, but power tools up fairly robustly. Tool storage up again, diagnostics down. It\u2019s sort of the story this quarter. It was a different story last quarter. Scott Stember : Got it. And moving over to RS&I, I know that we\u2019ve had a few really good quarters of sales comps. Part of it was the OEM business was coming back, but we see a return of choppiness there. How did you do in RS&I for the full year, again, on an organic basis? And given your commentary about some of the reluctance of some of the dealerships because of the weaker car sales, do you expect to get back to positive comps in 2020? Nick Pinchuk : I think we\u2019re not sure what happens with the OEM dealership business. That\u2019s the thing that we say, well, that\u2019s a lumpy business. And having worked for Ford myself, I can tell you that they \u2013 this is a business that changes cash flow every month for five year. They change their attitudes every month. So we\u2019re not sure. If I look out and looking at the IHS forecast, they\u2019re forecasting down 1% to 2% next year. I would think we\u2019d kind of see the same kind of stuff out for a little while. Now RS&I was up low single digits for the year. I think interestingly though, 26% for RS&I, I think, is the highest-ever gross OI margin, so they had an okay quarter from that perspective. It\u2019s just the sales were down because of that OEM business. But the information business, so where independent repair shops was up again, which was what drove that 26% because it\u2019s high-margin business, and Mitchell 1 is a \u2013 has been a consistent grower for us. So if you look at the RS&I businesses, I\u2019ll step back and talk about them, Mitchell 1 seems to grow consistently. We just invested in a new building. We didn\u2019t do so without thought. And therefore, we think that\u2019s got a great future. Diagnostics tends to go up and down but we\u2019re training the franchisees to be more comfortable with the new groundbreaking product of intelligent diagnostics. We expect that to go forward. The OEM businesses, which is about a third of the businesses, it\u2019s hard to predict, it can be lumpy. And significantly, lost in the sway here is the equipment business showed a positive this quarter for RS&I, and it hasn\u2019t been positive for a while. So we view that as a fairly \u2013 even in a turbulent quarter, we view that as one sign of good news. So going forward, I think \u2013 we think the OEM business, uncertain. Maybe it will be the same as this quarter for a while. But the rest of the businesses have good opportunity. Scott Stember : All right. And just last question. Your view of the business longer term, are you maintaining your expectation that the company, longer term, could be a mid-single-digit grower on an organic sales basis? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, yes. I think the market is there. I think we got the product and stake. I think we\u2019re capacity-bound. I\u2019ve said it \u2013 if you listen to us, for years, we\u2019ve said that one of the boundaries associated with the van channel, space and time, we\u2019re up against a time boundary. It\u2019s clear. You can see it, the way the world works. And so we have to break through that like we did in previous years. We had to come up with ways to make those franchisees use their time better, and we can do that, we think. And then in the C&I business, if you\u2019ve 13 straight quarters for industrial and with 5,700 new products, now that gets more and more complex and it drives inventory, but the dogs are buying the dog food there. The only thing is, in this particular quarter, one of the big businesses was low margin. That\u2019s not going to happen forever. Scott Stember : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions. First of all, just given the amount of time we\u2019ve spent talking about the field support, can we at least put a number on what the impact was to margins, Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Well, I don\u2019t recall all the field support specifically. Obviously, it\u2019s an investment that we make along with other internal metrics that we have, David. But you could see the drag that it creates in the OE section of the financial \u2013 of the Snap-on Tools Group. But we\u2019re not going to dimension it exactly. David MacGregor : So you can\u2019t give us some order of magnitude or any quant on that? Aldo Pagliari : No, I don\u2019t think so. David MacGregor : Okay. I guess, what percentage of your franchisees are up year-over-year in the fourth quarter? Aldo Pagliari : What? David MacGregor : What percentage of your franchisees would have seen growth in the fourth quarter? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t think we know that necessarily directly. Aldo Pagliari : Yes. The U.S. is up low single digit, as we\u2019ve said, and you\u2019ll get a mix within that portfolio. Some, of course, will be higher, some will be lower than that. But we\u2019re not going to parse among the number of franchisees that are up or the number that are down. Nick Pinchuk : Generally, we parse them by quintiles. And if you see the business up, it generally tends to be uniform across that. So what you find is, is that roughly 60% of the \u2013 60% to 65%, maybe two-thirds of the franchisees will be sort of in the same direction as the overall business. That\u2019s usually what happens in any one quarter. And those numbers swap in and out. It doesn\u2019t change that much from quarter-to-quarter, really. David MacGregor : Okay. And then it seems like we\u2019ve got to a point in our world where people are buying online, and I\u2019m sure that technicians are no exception to that rule. You\u2019re selling tools on your website. Can you just talk about it? And maybe this is a way to sort of tie in with the whole notion of the time boundary you referenced in answering the last caller\u2019s question. But what\u2019s the opportunity to develop online sales here? Maybe find a way to pass the credit back to the appropriate franchisees that customers registered to. But talk a little bit about the opportunity to grow online as\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : I think our customers don\u2019t \u2013 we offer them online. But generally, our customers value the presence, the face-to-face presence of the franchisees. That is \u2013 I think that is the point. The idea of providing up close and personal counseling and guidance on how the explanation of the tool, which are getting more, I guess, more complicated, more sophisticated and the guidance on how to use it, then the idea of providing credit up close and personal, and then the idea of having a replacement right there is what our franchisees and our customers seem to like. They could go online but they don\u2019t necessarily avail themselves of that. Now if we thought we were getting pushed by that, we would be looking at it a little bit more, but hand tools are up and you would think that would be the number one product line that would be bought online since it\u2019s less complicated than people tend to know hand tools. But the hand tools are up for the year. In fact, they\u2019ve been more robust over the past couple of years. So that\u2019s our kind of view of it. We try to use the online capabilities to enhance. It\u2019s one of the things we try to do to enhance the efficiency of the franchisees in terms of their collections, in terms of the way they communicate with their customers on specials and those kinds of things. Those are the opportunities we see. We see the connection either through social media or traditional online, either Twitter, either Facebook or Twitter or in fact, texting or just email, not that many people use e-mail anymore. And for our franchisees to communicate and make our customers aware of things, that\u2019s part of our view of online and enabling the franchisees to be more efficient. David MacGregor : So how would online growth look for you right now? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think it\u2019s not. David MacGregor : Off a small base, obviously. But I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : It\u2019s probably up some but not very significant. It\u2019s not very significant because online for us, our customers are looking at the idea, the support they get from the franchisees. So what we try to do is keep that franchisee supported in place because it\u2019s part of our advantage, and secondly, try to use whatever the electronic media is to enable the franchisees more, just as I said. David MacGregor : Okay. Well, maybe I could follow up offline with you, it\u2019s an interesting topic. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Sara Verbsky for any additional or closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call, and we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Additional information, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, is included in our earnings release and in our conference call slides on Pages 14 through 16. Both can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Well, as some say, these are interesting times. There's considerable turbulence in business and all across the everyday landscape. But I believe we can be confident that Snap-on will navigate through it all and come out stronger than when it all started, just as we have done in the past. Before we get going, I think it's appropriate for all of you listening in, the investors, associates, franchisees, customers, retirees and analysts. You have our best wishes that you and your families weather these times safely and without harm.  Now, let's speak of Snap-on. Firstly, we're keeping our team safe. Snap-on people are working from home and where that's not possible and there are a number of these instances we're proceeding using government prescribed guide lines in the United States those put forward by the Centre for Disease Control the CDC, physical distancing, the use of personal protection equipment, cleaning of facilities deep and often, staggered shifts and break, and quick attention to those who have symptoms.  For our franchisees, we're active in helping, providing a playbook for staying safe. The people of the Snap-on team are a great advantage, working hard to preserve them and as we move through this difficulty. Having said that, it's clear our operations are essential. Snap-on plays an important role in the underpinning of our society supporting vital activities, like the military, transportation infrastructure, our critical vehicle repair, the areas we all depend on for emergency services, for food delivery, for distribution of medical supplies, and for a variety of essential needs. Government bodies, including the US Department of Homeland Security and multiple states have deemed it so.  And there have been clear examples that critical role from the United States to Italy, to the UK. And as such, our factories and distribution centers have pretty much remained active doing their part, keeping the world going. Consistent with that, our sourcing teams have been able to maintain our supply chain supporting both our factories and our kitting centers. Overwhelmingly, our sourcing partners have recognized the criticality of our needs, and have remained active to provide support. Now in this arena, particularly in the US, we do have an advantage because we make in the markets where we sell. Our supply chain is fine. As you might expect, the impact of the virus varies across our operating landscape. Asia in general, and China in particular has seen the impact for some time, but now, particularly in China, it's showing some rays of light, restaurants are opening and people are driving in mass. Europe has seen weak economics for several quarters, and COVID-19 has made it worse, pretty much all over. It's a region that seems particularly hard hit. Of course, there's a lot being written about the United States, we do see a mix. There are points of light, primarily in the middle of the country, where franchisees have set personal positive records. And there are places particularly in the northeast where activity has been significantly restricted. And there are locations not that many at this point where we've seen green shoots of recovery.  If you view the world by business segment, most seem quite impacted. Oil and gas, of course, education and vehicle OEM projects, but there are other places like the military, like general industry and like trucking that appear more positive. Regardless of the current landscape, we believe we have the resilience and the strength to navigate the downturn, as Snap-on has done so many times before. The fact that since 1939, over all those years encountering several periods of significant challenge, Snap-on has paid a dividend every quarter and it's never reduced it. That record stands as evidence of a resilience.  So in that regard, we believe our longer term prospects have not been impacted, or the timelines are uncertain. We are confident on a positive outcome to this inner loop. You can see it in the last recession in 2009. Remember how uncertain it was? Bad news for breakfast, people thinking about putting their money in the mattresses, the idea of more deep wall seeming okay without stigma. Well, if you look at Snap-on's record during that weathering, we navigated the turbulence and came out stronger.  We believe that reflects the essential nature of our business, the strength of our position in that business and the experience and capability of our team. That wasn't our first rodeo. And neither is this. Because we believe in that recovery, we're keeping up with the elements of Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. It's particularly evident in customer connection and innovation. Even in the turbulence, we're continuing with the stream of new products, the green shoots will grow, and we're going to be ready. Well, that's the overview. Let me turn to the results. First Quarter as reported sales were 852.2 million down 7.5%, including a 10.3 million or 100 basis point impact from unfavorable foreign currency. Organic sales declined 6.9%, reflecting the ongoing weakness in Europe and the impact of the global economic uncertainty associated with COVID-19.  From an earnings perspective, Opco OI for the quarter of 138.9 million including 7.5 million of restructuring charges principally focused on Europe and 3.3 million of unfavorable currency effect was 48.5 million lower than 2019, which included $11.6 million benefit from the settlement of patent related litigation matters and that's a mouthful. But the 2020 as adjusted Opco OI of 146.4 million excluding restructuring was down 16.7% from last year's as adjusted level. And if you consider the sequential impact of the turbulence caused by the pandemic, the first quarter sales of 852 million were down organically from the fourth quarter of 2019 by 10.5%, while the periods as adjusted OI of 146.4 million was down 14.6%. Regarding Opco's OI margin, the as adjusted 17.2% recorded in the first quarter compared with the as adjusted 19.1% and the 17.9% registered in the prior year and in the prior quarter respectively.  For financial services operating income of 56.9 million was down from last year's 62.1 million, including a $2.6 million higher credit reserve as a result of the economic uncertainty associated with the virus. Overall EPS on an as reported basis was $2. 49 and it compared to $3.16 last year. The as adjusted EPS was $2.60 and that compared with last year $3.01, down 13.5%.  Now let's move to the groups. C&I saw mixed progress to the end of February attenuated by significant declines in March, volume in the first quarter of 299.9 million including 5.3 million unfavorable foreign currency translation was down versus last year's 322.5 million, primarily on double digit declines in Asia Pacific and in Europe, reflecting the longer impact of the virus in Asia and the ongoing economic weakness in Europe combined with the later period effects of COVID-19. From an earnings perspective C&I operating income of 31.5 million decreased 15 million from 2019, including 4.4 million of restructuring and 1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Now critical industries did show variation with relatively favorable performance in the military, trucking fleet and general industry. You can see the essential nature of those areas in our activities, as we supported the production and the maintenance of the F-35 fighter and as our critical tools helped keep the London ambulances on the road.  That positive activity was offset by weakness in natural resources, education and aerospace as some of our commercial customers struggled to respond to the pandemic and the resulting lower oil prices and technical school shutdowns and reduced flight and generally lower capital spending. Overall, however, the critical industries reflecting in part the essential nature of those tests were flat in the turbulence. We do remain confident in and committed to extending in the critical industry. So as a matter of fact, we're continuing to strengthen our product line enhancing our position even in the attenuated environment. A great example just introduced this quarter from the power tools division is the new CT9100 three quarter inch cordless impact wrench equipped with the market leading combination of power and durability. The three quarter inch drive Anvil makes the unit great for essential tasks for big industrial applications, for power generation, for heavy duty fleets and for the military, where fastener sizes are larger, torque values are higher and reliability and consistent performances are pretty critical.  With its five amp hour lithium battery to CT9100 provides the 1000 pounds feet of bolting and 1300 pound feet of breakaway torque. That's real power and beyond the strength the tool has considerable versatility, three torque settings in forward and three in reverse optimizing performance for a wide range of applications, and it has a built in break, preventing the pot that powerful wrench from throwing fasteners or sockets around when you use it. That's a significant safety feature. The tool is built in our Murphy, North Carolina plant, and it uses best in class components for superior toughness of substantial strength and long service life. The new impact was just released in February and in a limited distribution but it's already on track to become a hit $1 million product. It's been quite well received C&I, navigating the turbulence with customer connection, and innovation serving the essential.  Now onto the tools group, sales were 375.9 million in the quarter reflecting $31.8 million organic decline and 2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The progress we saw in the US van channel early in the quarter was erased, and the continuing weakness of the international operation was amplified by the virus as the virus spread more widely. The operating earnings of 48.6 million including 1.4 of unfavorable foreign currency compared to 67.2 million in 2019.  One advantage, we believe our franchisees entered the difficulties with a strong underlying position and that base will come in handy during the immediate future. And as I said before van activity is mixed. There are points of light. We saw great record setting franchisee performance in Iowa, even in New York some have adjusted well turning in strong results, but there are places where the network is attenuated. The vans aren't seeing variation, but we have considerable confidence in their ability to adjust and return to full strength.  We've done it before in disasters like Superstorm Sandy and Hurricanes, Maria and Harvey, and the tools team is working again in this difficulty with focus to make sure our franchisees weather the storm and emerge with advantage. We're supporting the franchisees with tailored programs, targeted promotions and with again great new product, products like the new line of quarter inch drive Stubby Ratchets, boasting the shortest length on the market, the fixed head at two and a half inches and the flex set at three and a quarter inches, both offer improved accessibility and constraint spaces like over a quarter inch drive ratchets.  The new Stubby's include Dual 80 technology for convenient ratcheting arc five degrees and for more power and less lateral space. These have sealed heads which ensure long tool life and a screw style joint design that enables very easy repair all while maximizing strength. The new ratchets, they were launched regionally again in March and initial sales were nearly a million dollars, a significant success for a hand tool in a regional introduction, especially in the storm.  Now, let's talk about tool storage. Holding its own in the face of the pandemic, helped in part by the hundredth anniversary limited edition epic Roll Cab with the centennial themed panels and medallions, the 68 inch epic with the LED lighted power tool top features a gunmetal clear coat paint scheme and new brush red trim color, darker and richer than our standard. At first time color combination highlights our continued innovation and emphasizes our capacity to expand color choices for Cab and it captures the attention of technicians who want to declare they are a very special professional. Only 1920, were founded in 1920, only 1920 were built. In the numbered medallions will showcase each boxes place in Snap-on's history. Reception was strong, the buck sold out. Well that's the tools group navigating the challenges underpinned by strong product.  Now speaking of RS&I, the RS&I group finished the quarter at 314.6 million in sales compared to 327.9 million last year, reflecting at 12.9 million organic sales decrease. The growth through February showing an improvement in all businesses with the exception of our automotive OEM facing operation was overcome by slippage in March. Deeper decreases in the OEM area and end of quarter weakness in - end of quarter weaker volume in under car equipment for both automotive dealerships and independent repair shops. RS&I operating earnings of 77.3 million decreased 6.3 million including 3.1 million of European focused restructuring.  Operating margin was 24.6% including 100 basis points from the restructuring and compared to the 25.5% recorded last year. Excluding restructuring the OI margin was 25.6% up 10 basis points for RS&I despite the pandemic. Now the overall growth was impacted by continuing weakness in OEM programs and equipment volumes. Our diagnostics and repair information businesses did advance in the quarter and we're working to keep that momentum going with innovative new products and features attractions like our recently introduced interactive truck wiring diagrams. It's an enhancement to the Mitchell 1 heavy duty repair information system.  Now, just like the light vehicles technicians with the Mitchell 1 system can click on any picture component in a truck retrieving - when looked at a wiring diagram, it can retrieve a pop-up menu with specifications, physical locations, connector views and guided component tests. The new productivity enhancing truck wiring diagrams were introduced in late February. It was at a press conference, attended by the industry's top publications and reception was great. It's one of the reasons why Mitchell 1 kept growing in the quarter.  Also, during February we launched our new SOLUS Legend diagnostic scan tool. It's quick, a 10 second boot up and the ability to display scan results in as little as 30 seconds. It also offers a best in class eight inch touch screen color display, and it combines a full diagnostic capability. It combines full diagnostic capabilities for both standard vehicles and for motorcycles into one platform. That's a very popular feature. The new handheld also provides access to our sure track vehicle specific real fixes, repair tips, and commonly replaced parts all derived from operation Primary database of 1.3 billion repair actions. SOLUS Legend has the look of a very successful addition to our lineup.  We're confident in the strength of the RS&I product line we keep driving to expand its position with a repair shop owners and managers making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. Well, that's a Snap-on first quarter. Some momentum in the beginning checked by the virus, making sure our team is safe, maintaining our operations, they're essential to society, navigating the mixed effects of the virus across our geographies and industries, knowing we can weather the difficulties, not knowing the exact timeline but confident that our position is positive going forward and keeping our companies strong, Snap-on value creation and a continuing string of new products.  Now turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $852.2 million in the quarter compared to $921.7 million last year, reflecting a 6.9% organic sales decline, $10.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $3.5 million of acquisition related sales. The organic sales decrease this quarter primarily reflected the impact of economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales declines and all three operating segments and across most geographies.  Through the month of February, with the exception of Asia Pacific and certain European geographies, sales were up on a year-over-year basis, as the effects of COVID-19 spread across Europe and the United States in March and as further government actions were put in place, demand slowed and access to some customers was interrupted, resulting in the lower year-over-year sales for the quarter.  During the quarter as a result of the continued economic slowdown in Europe as well as effects of COVID-19, we recorded $7.5 million of restructuring costs for actions primarily associated with our European operations. These costs were recorded in both the commercial industrial group and the repair systems and information group.  Consolidated gross margin of 49.5% compared to 51.2% last year, which is one of the highest quarterly gross margins reported in Snap-on's recent history. The 170 basis points decrease primarily reflect 60 basis points from restructuring costs, the impact of lower volumes, cost associated with COVID-19 related operating disruptions and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  The decrease was partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. Despite the cost of restructurings and the impact of COVID-19 the first quarter, the gross margin rate of 49.5% improved sequentially from 47.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  The operating expenses margin of 33.2% increased 230 basis points from 30.9% last year. The first quarter of 2019 included $11.6 million or 120 basis point benefit associated with the legal settlement Nick mentioned earlier. The remaining increase primarily reflects the impact of lower sales volumes, 30 basis points from restructuring actions and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating earnings before financial services of $138.9 million, including 7.5 million of restructuring cost and 3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $187.4 million in 2019, which included the $11.6 million legal settlement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 16.3% compared to 20.3% last year. On an adjusted basis for both years, excluding the impact of restructuring and the benefit of the legal settlement, operating earnings before financial services of $146.4 million, or 17.2% of sales decreased 16.7% from $175.8 million or 19.1% of sales in 2019.  Financial Services revenue of $85.9 million in the first quarter of 2020, compared to $85.6 million last year, while operating earnings of 56.9 million compared to 62.1 million in 2019, primarily reflecting a $4.5 million increase in provisions for credit losses. Included in the higher provisions under the recently adopted accounting standard update topic 326 on credit losses, often referred to as CECL was $2.6 million of higher reserve requirements resulting from the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Consolidated operating earnings of $195.8 million, including $7.5 million of restructuring charges, $2.6 million of higher credit reserve requirements and $3.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $249.5 million last year, which included the legal settlement.  As a percentage of revenues the operating earnings margin of 20.9% compared to 24.8% last year. On an adjusted basis in both years excluding restructuring and the legal settlement, operating earnings of 203.3 million or 21.7% of revenues decreased 14.5% from $237.9 million, or 23.6% of revenues in 2019.  Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 24.2% compared to 24.3% last year. The effective rate in both periods were increased by 10 basis points from the restructuring charges in 2020 and the legal settlement in 2019. Finally, net earnings of $137.2 million or $2.49 per share, including an $0.11 charge for restructuring, a $0.04 impact from the COVID-19 related credit provisions and a $0.05 unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency compared to $177.9 million, or $3.16 per share a year ago.  On an adjusted basis, excluding the restructuring charges this year and the $0.15 benefit from the legal settlement in 2019, net earnings of 143.2 million or $2.60 per share, compared to $169.2 million or $3.01 per share last year.  Now, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $299.9 million compared to $322.5 million last year, reflecting a 5.7% organic sales decline and a $5.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by 0.7 million of acquisition related sales.  The organic decrease primarily includes double digit declines in sales in both the segments Asia Pacific operations and European based hand tools business, partially offset by a high single digit gain in our power tools operations. Gross Margin of 36.8% decreased to 360 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to 150 basis points from $4.4 million of restructuring charges. The impact of lower sales volumes, as well as higher sales and lower gross margin businesses including sales to the military, and costs associated with COVID-19 related operating disruptions. These decreases were partially offset from savings from the company's RCI initiatives.  The operating expense margin 26.3% increased 30 basis points from 26% last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment have $31.5 million, including $4.4 million of restructuring charges and $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $46.5 million last year. The operating margin of 10.5%, including the 150 basis point charge for restructuring, compared to 14.4% a year ago, and 12.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019.  Turning now to Slide 8, sales Snap-on Tools group of $375.9 million, compared to $410.2 million in 2019, reflecting a 7.8% organic sales decline, and $2.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation.  The organic sales decline includes a mid single digit decrease in our US franchise operations and a double digit decline internationally. As Nick mentioned, sales in the United States were up year-over-year from February before the wider government restrictions impacted access to certain customers or locations during March.  Gross Margin of 42.7% declined 190 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volume, costs associated with COVID-19 related operating disruptions, and 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 29.8% increased from 28.2% last year, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volumes and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools group of $48.6 million, including a $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $67.2 million last year, while the operating margin of 12.9% compared to 16.4% a year ago, and 13.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $314.6 million compared to $327.9 million a year ago, reflecting a 4% organic sales decline and $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation partially offset by $2.8 million of acquisition related sales.  The organic sales decrease includes double digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships, and a low single digit decrease in sales of undercar equipment, partially offset by a low single digit gain in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 47.9%, including 20 basis points of cost from restructuring, decreased 30 basis points from 48.2% last year. The operating expense margin of 23.3%, including 80 basis points of cost from restructuring, increased 60 basis points from 22.7% in 2019.  Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $77.3 million compared to $83.6 million a year ago. And the operating margin of 24.6% including 100 basis points of cost from restructuring, decreased 90 basis points from 25.5% last year.  Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from Financial Services of $85.9 million compares to $85.6 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $56.9 million, compared to $62.1 billion in 2019.  Financial Services expenses of $29 million increased 5.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to $4.5 million of increases in the provision for credit losses, which included $2.6 million under topic 326 or CECL for the impact of COVID-19. Excluding the $2.6 million associated with COVID-19, provisions for credit losses increased $500,000 from those recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.4% or 1.1% in the first quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The average yield on finance receivables in the first quarter of 2020 was 17.7% compared to 17.8% last year. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 9% and 9.1.  Total loan originations of $255.6 million increased $3.1 million, or 1.2%, primarily due to a 1.1% increase in originations of finance receivables, and a 2% increase in originations of contract receivables, principally franchise finance. In the United States, extended originations were up 2% larger reflecting higher franchisee sales of big ticket products.  Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.1 billion of gross financing receivables, including 1.9 billion from our US operation. Our worldwide gross Financial Services portfolio decreased $19.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to $26 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The 60 day plus delinquency rate of 1.7% for the United States extended credit is up 20 basis points from a year ago, but remains well below level seen in 2008 to 2010 and improved 10 basis points sequentially.  As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the largest portion of the portfolio, trailing 12 month net losses of $50.4 million represented 2.99% of outstandings at quarter-end, up 8 basis points sequentially of which approximately 4 basis points is as a result of the unfavorable foreign currency effects on the portfolio.  Now, turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $213.4 million in the quarter increased $12.1 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including decreases in working investment, partially offset by lower net earnings.  Net cash used by investing activities of $49.8 million included capital expenditures of $17.2 million and net additions to finance receivables of $22.1 million. Additions to and collections of finance receivables were consistent with that of the prior year. In the quarter, our free cash flow from operating company of $143 million improved $10.7 million, as lower working investment largely offset the change in year-over-year net earnings. Additionally, the first quarter of 2019 cash flow reflected the settlement of a legal matter which resulted in a decrease in accrued liabilities of $11.6 million in that prior year period.  Total free cash flow or cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures and the net change in finance receivables of $174.1 million represented 123% of net earnings. Net Cash used by financing activities of 157.1 million included cash dividends of $59 million and the repurchase of 349,000 shares of common stock for $50.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $313.3 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable decreased $59.4 million from 2019 your end including $21.9 million from unfavorable foreign currency translation. Days sales outstanding of 62 days, compared to 67 days at 2019 year-end. Inventories decreased $3 million, including 25.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency from 2019 year-end. On a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2.5 compared to 2.6 at year-end 2019.  At quarter-end cash position of $185.8 million compared to $184.5 million at year-end 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 21.7% compared to 22.1 at year-end 2019. At the end of the quarter, we had $150 million of short-term borrowings under our $800 billion revolving credit facility that terminates in September 2024. These funds were largely utilized to pay down commercial paper outstanding at year-end 2019. As such, there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at the end of the quarter, and our net debt levels were similar to year-end.  As of the end of the quarter, we were well within the permitted ranges set forth in the credit facilities financial covenants. Despite the uncertainty in the credit and financial markets, we currently believe we have sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover expected funding needs in both the near term and on a long term basis.  That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few updated outlook items. While we do not generally provide quarterly sales or earnings projections in the near term, we anticipate no improvement in the macroeconomic environment. And as a result, expect sales, credit originations and earnings in the second quarter of 2020 to be lower than those in the same period last year. We now anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $70 million to $80 million as compared to our prior estimate of $90 million to $100 billion. Additionally, we currently anticipate that our full year 2020 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 25%.  I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks Aldo. Snap-on first quarter, progress interrupted, a time of multiple headwinds, the ongoing economic weakness in Europe, the continuing impact of COVID-19 in Asia and the spread of the virus in Europe and North America, all in this quarter. As I said, our team's experienced. This isn't our first encounter with deep difficulty and in this we are keeping our people safe, working from home and when we can't, distancing, using PPE where appropriate, and cleaning deep and often. What we do is essential to society and we're acting accordingly, maintaining operations to keep the world going, supporting the professionals performing critical tasks.  The impact of the virus is mixed across our businesses, some sliding deeper, some flattening, some getting better, all at the same time. But we're confident that the continuing and essential nature of our mission, the advantage of our position, the strength of our balance sheet, the extraordinary experience and capability of our team will carry us through the turmoil. Our long history, navigating disruption, our dividend record, and our performance in the last great recession, all say so. We don't know the timeline or the shape of the disruption. But we do know we'll resume our upward trend with surety and because of that we're confident. Because of that confidence, we're working to preserve our strengths and our advantages.  We keep driving the elements of Snap-on value creation, building our capability, expanding our products, nurturing our networks, and we believe we'll emerge from this turbulence stronger than when we entered as we have so often before. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our associates and franchisees, the Snap-on front line. I know you're listening today. We will all pass through this challenge together. And in this difficulty, there's no other team I would rather be standing with for your courage in meeting the difficulties you have my admiration, for your capability and navigating the challenges of the day, you have my congratulations, and for your dedication and fulfilling your essential role in supporting our society, you have my thanks.  Now I'll turn the call over to up to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from David Leiker with Baird. Erin Welcenbach : Good morning. This is Erin Welcenbach on for David. So my first question is about the sale of big ticket products. Based on the finance receivable originations and your commentary, it sounds like that held in better than maybe expected. So I guess I'm wondering if you can give any color on how that shaped up I guess throughout the quarter and expectations of that given the weaker economic conditions in Q2? Nick Pinchuk : I think when you talk about looking forward I think we think we're going into a little more turbulence. It's going to be extended. Remember that the first California shelter at home was only done I think March 22. So we're only talking about a relatively short period of time in this kind of situation. So it's hard to make any extrapolations on that. But if you look at the quarter, here's what happened, I think I said it, tool storage held its own, diagnostics is pretty good and so you had the underpinning of those things. But remember that originations and sales \u2013 Tools group sales don't necessarily match up, there's a timing difference. And in the quarter the sales of the truck exceeded, were positive actually, exceeding the Tools group sales. So you have some of that mismatch there. But as I said, we were kind of pleased with the tool storage business held its own. Erin Welcenbach : Okay, that's helpful. And then Nick, I think you had mentioned that you were doing some things to support the franchisees during this time, can you provide some more color on some of the actions you're taking? Nick Pinchuk : Well, first and foremost what we're doing is we're trying to give them a playbook. I don't think many people have seen this before. So we're trying to \u2013 we did this actually in Superstorm Sandy. That's why I mentioned this stuff and Maria and so on. Each disaster is a little bit differently, what we're trying to tell them how to conduct their business serving essential and serving essential and critical tasks in the atmosphere of distancing. And so we have a playbook to help them and then we're kind of working with them with other things in terms of working with their financials and they're working with their business managers in each of their locations to try to find a path and the particular prescription that will help them and their individual franchisees move forward. Like I said, what I was trying to say is the world is mixed. So we have guys in Iowa who are kicking it. There was a guy in Iowa who had a tough week we couldn't believe and even in New York and in the New Rochelle area we had, but on the other hand, other people are having difficulties, so we try to \u2013 we're adjusting to each person, each franchisee. Erin Welcenbach : Okay, and then finally, on Asia Pacific, you mentioned a better trajectory coming on to the end of the quarter and higher miles driven. I'm wondering what do you think is driving the miles driven recovery there, is just some pent up demand or are you seeing some at least anecdotes of a structural shift in terms of consumer behavior or kind of a preference towards private vehicle ownership? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I don't know, this is early days and the thing is, I didn't say necessarily. I said, we see green shoots of recovery there, but do you want to be riding the subway now? I don't know. Right. Do you want to be taking a bus? Do you want to be ride sharing? I think this is a change. It's going to echo for a while. And we're seeing that in Beijing, Beijing snapped back in terms of traffic. I think people can see this in our anecdotal evidence about Shanghai is the same. So I think you're at least temporarily seeing people say I don't want to get sick again. Erin Welcenbach : Okay great, thank you for taking my questions. Nick Pinchuk : So I think actually ownership, I mean, when you go through that is it. I don't know I want to be selling real estate in New York now or for the next \u2013 for the future. Operator : And we will take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington. Gary Prestopino : Good morning, everyone. Hey, could you maybe tell us and if you don't want to do that, that's fine. But what was the slide in sales over the last two weeks of March across all your businesses on an aggregate basis. Nick Pinchuk : I say what you be \u2013 let me put it this way. Cut it you Gary, say, look, you could be confident it was double digits for sure. It was \u2013 we were down single digits. We said we were up already, we had a reasonable quarter and is going particularly in the Tools group US seemed pretty reasonable for us. So that was a significant slide. But I don't think \u2013 look, Gary, I don't think Gary, I don't think you can make a conclusion of that. Because remember, it's only a month. You got individual \u2013 franchisees who are trying to figure out how to deal with this, so it's hard to make any conclusions about those weeks I think. That's what we're thinking. It's going to play out in the future. Of course, we're going to live with it longer, but I'm not sure those weeks are extrapolation for the future. Gary Prestopino : Okay, like I said, I'm just trying to get an idea of the magnitude here. If you look across your customer base really worldwide, I mean, how much of that do you still have access to? Nick Pinchuk : Well, let's put it this way. I think in the Commercial Industrial group, if you're talking about the people, like the critical industry, generally we have access. Yeah, businesses some of those people are getting hammered like oil and gas or some of the aerospace businesses are getting hammered. So businesses are attenuated bug places. And so when we talk to our people, it's a mix. Some of them are calling directly on the people, some are dealing at a distance through social media or email or things like that or phone calls. If you're talking about the franchisee, same kind of thing, it's a mix, depending on where you live and where you're at and the size of the dealership and their requirements. One of the things that's true is generally we're pretty sure that critical repairs are happening. If somebody needs \u2013 if somebody's got a check engine, like they're bringing it in. If somebody going for oil changes, doesn't seem like it's happening. So we can tell that. And so some of the businesses that focused on that are a little less receptive to having people come in, if you're a transmission guy, you're probably doing okay. And you expect or people don't, it's quite a mix. Gary Prestopino : Okay, and then lastly, could you maybe just go back to 2008, 2009, obviously, every situation is different, but we did have one hell of a recession at that period. What were the indicators to you that the business was coming back? I mean, which segments started to really show significant, I guess lack of a better word green shoots in and that you felt that okay to start to try. Nick Pinchuk : It was a different deal, of course, but big ticket items coming back was the big thing. Generally, it was the attenuation of bad news for breakfast. I think people were getting scared by what they were being told about the banking system that was that was affecting it. So generally, it was big ticket in that situation, because people only were buying. I remember talking about it incessantly. People were only buying short payback items. And if you look at that, when we have recession, if you look at it, we came out of it and by the time you got to 2011 our trajectory was still a healthy double digits and profit growth, including at least us. Gary Prestopino : Yeah, I do remember that. Okay, thanks. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We will take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Bret Jordan : When you look at the service channel, I mean, independent volume seemed that they were down 30% to 50% here in a pretty short period of time. I guess you're looking at the credit book and a lot of these guys are getting paid on piece work. Do you think that in the short-term, we're going to see delinquencies exceed what you saw in '08, '09 just give the magnitude and the relatively quick speed of the crank? And then I guess a follow up question on franchisee health, I mean, obviously, you hear about a lot of small businesses that didn't have liquidity to go into this type of dramatic contraction in a short period of time as well. I guess, are you doing much across the board, you talked about a couple of franchisees that are doing particularly well, but if you think about average franchisee liquidity, are you going to need to step in and help them a little bit in the second quarter assuming volumes remain down pretty dramatically. Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think first of all, I think that the jury's out on delinquency rates, I'm not so sure how it will behave. I remember that losses improved, went up 100 basis points in the recession last time and delinquencies did go up. I think there is a question of the shock of this all that I think there's going to be sort of like timelines that will work its way through this situation where people get shocked and then figure it out and then deal with it for a while. I don't know what those timelines are. In terms of helping our franchisees, like I said, it depends on the segment of the country. For example, if you look at the Northeast, the franchisees are a little more attenuated. If you look at places like the central region or the North Central region where we're living in, where we're sitting in, now it's not so bad. Northwest seems to be coming back a little bit. If you look at certain indicators, so we would look at franchisee by franchisee and then we would talk about things like well, loan extensions for them and some help in terms of their position. And we did that in the past, we did it in Superstorm Sandy, we did it in Maria, we did it in Harvey and it all worked out very well for us because our business managers highlight those guys who need help. And we get out there and help them. And of course, there are government programs they can access to, although I don't think it's that easy to do it these days. But in general, we've seen this movie before, in a more narrow way. Puerto Rico, in the East Coast and in the Houston area, and our actions around having the business managers deal with the franchisees and help them in some cases giving them extensions of deferral has worked very well for us. Bret Jordan : Okay, great, thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Operator : We will take our next question from Scott Stember with CL King. Scott Stember : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Scott Stember : You talked about how big ticket items such as storage held its own in the quarter, but can you just give us your expectations? I know you don't really guide by month or quarter, but is it safe to assume that we're going to start seeing some elevated declines in big ticket items at least in April. Nick Pinchuk : What I'm trying to say Scott is sure, I think, if you're going to \u2013 if we're to lay bets now, I'd lay bets that the second quarter is worse than last year. And I lay bets that we have more weeks of eggs in the second quarter than we had in the first quarter. The shape of that is what I don't know because I don't know I think there was a lot of experience. I think \u2013 if you think about it in a practical sense, okay, you've got guys who are working on essential. Everybody recognize what we do is essential. Everybody recognizes this. The Department of Homeland Security talks about automotive repair. So every state proclamation says that, but our people are worried about how they deal with the customers. The customers are trying to figure out how they ply their essential trade. And our people are trying to figure out how to deal with them.  And so it's hard to figure out how that's going to play out. I don't know. I'm not sure. But we see a lot of variation in our situation. Yeah, big ticket, if you say, look, a recession creates eggs, and people are worried about uncertainty. Big ticket tends to go down like it did in the last environment because people say I don't want it. I got to hasten my own cash. But my suggestion is what's going to happen eventually is people come out of the woodwork to give their cars repaired. It's one of the first things that happen. Now, I don't know the timeline for that. But that's why I'm being a little bit I can't really predict so much about the second quarter, except that we're going to manage \u2013 I can't tell you anything that you don't know, really, these kinds of things. Scott Stember : No, that's fair enough. And just \u2013 maybe just give us a little bit more commentary what you're hearing from the van channel, what they're seeing at the repair shop level as far as the help, the employment picture with their mechanics and just \u2013 and I know that we're milestone have been off obviously a lot, but just the general commentary about what they're seeing? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, generally \u2013 again, I'm sorry, it's like \u2013 it's mixed. Some are sliding papers, some are flattening, some are getting better. That's what I hear, but I will tell you this, I think, now, if you look at the BLS data, the BLS data says that the nominal spending of households on automotive repair in February, year-over-year was up 8% and change. So I would suggest that just like our franchisees, the garage has entered it, not bad shape. So I think the resilience is probably pretty good in this situation, so I don't \u2013 some are probably \u2013 we know some are closed, some are operating at reduced hours, some are going gangbusters. So it just depends I think in this situation. I can't say. I know that's not very helpful to building a model or anything, but I can't really give you anything like that. I think the one piece of data, I do think is worthwhile is that both the nominal repairs and that the household spending and the technician wages were up in February year-over-year. So I think they entered pretty good. Scott Stember : Got it and last question, just remind us what \u2013 just going back to '08 through 2010, what the 60 day delinquency numbers went up to from a percentage standpoint and the losses \u2013 the total losses in the portfolio on a trailing 12 month basis. Thanks. Nick Pinchuk : I'll let Aldo answer that. Aldo Pagliari : Scott. I don't have the exact delinquency numbers in front of me. But they would be not so dissimilar to what you're seeing today. But the losses went up about 100 basis points. I think I mentioned earlier on the call, they hit a peak in a negative sense in Q4 of '09, and then moved from around 3% over the portfolio to around 4%. And then they declined back to below 3% until recent times, so that gives you a range I guess or a feel for what it might be like. Scott Stember : Got it, thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thanks, good morning. A lot's been asked, but just around the outlook lacking guidance. So I was curious, what your sense is of what among your three operating segments might see the biggest pain as you look at it? Should we use the 1Q magnitudes as a guide? Nick Pinchuk : Look, I think my own view is Europe is sick. It was weak going \u2013 it was weak coming in here. About 18% of our business in Europe, that's the big \u2013 it's got a big dollop in C&I and so that's probably the place I think is going to be tougher. If you look at Spain and Italy, the pre-book of Milan asked us to get back in business in Italy because we were essential in that place. But I just think Europe's going to have a tougher time coming out of this. Asia. It's spreading through the \u2013 I think China starts to come back. Japan I think is resilient. I think Southeast Asia, I don't know your Indonesia seems to be sinking, Philippines seems to be in trouble and India has completely shut down. So I don't know about the southern Asia. I think China and Korea, and maybe Japan start to excel. United States, you guys know as best as I do, I kind of think so that in our business, our people will learn, will adjust to this, the garages will adjust and it'll kind of \u2013 they'll be adapting to this and we're going to help them. The question is how quickly does that happen? And we know it's going to be four more weeks in a second quarter. So I can't give you much more guidance than that. But I think we're better off in the United States and Europe for sure. Christopher Glynn : Okay, and then I was just curious on the costs to manage supply chains, people safety through the COVID experience. What is that layer of cost like in terms of magnitude or what do you have to spend for continuity? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I don't think so much about continuity. You have lower volumes, so you have more people on the payroll and so on. I think the question is, what do you do about that as you go forward as the lower volumes get smaller? I think I've said in many forum that we're looking at this carefully. We have two sets of what we call profit assurance actions that will take actions depending on how long things go and so on. But we're not going to take precipitous action based on a few weeks. We have of course done the standard stuff like reduce travel and done other things. I would expect that on the other hand, working from home tends to be a little less efficient, I think. And so you have that floating. I would \u2013 I don't think we have a real number on the cost to clean and so on. Generally, though, our cases I'd say knock on wood seem to be stabilizing. So we seem to be in reasonable shape in that area. So I don't think we have \u2013 you can look at the first quarter make any conclusions about extrapolating those costs going forward because if it gets worse, we'll have to take other actions to reduce our costs. Christopher Glynn : Okay, thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle : Good morning. Thanks very much. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Curtis Nagle : Good morning Nick, how you doing? Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Curtis Nagle : Good. Okay, so turning just quickly back to the Tools group and then franchise network. I guess how many of the 3,500 or so in the fleet, how many are actually operating right now or are there any that are mandated not to run because of social distancing and things like that? Nick Pinchuk : Look, we pretty much by phone talk to every franchisee every day and I would say a relatively small number, pretty small number are not running. But there's variations of that all the way up. we would say a lion's share of them are operating on a relatively normal, but attenuated activity because if they spend an hour, they're not getting as much return from some of the people because maybe they're not buying big ticket items or it's taken longer to get to people or they're have to set up an organization. And in between there there's a bunch of gradations. People might be working. Small number may be working on partial shifts or partial days. Some people are not even taken out their trucks.  They're putting their stuff in the car and they're driving around. Other people are spending half their day setting up appointments and then going out, but the lion's share of the business and way over the majority is working as normal, maybe not getting the returns as normal. Now, when I say working as normal, I'm not saying they're rolling into every garage or anything like that. Some garages are going into, other garages are putting the stuff on the outside, other people are bringing them on the van one by one. We had a guy who had a customer event, really, he brought people on he had tea and had food on the van, but he limited the number of people on and forced distancing. I had a great day. Curtis Nagle : Got it, okay, understood. And then kind of thinking about \u2013 so again, vehicle repairs is an essential service we'll get cars back in the road to some normalized at some point, but I would think, at least in the kind of a shorter, maybe a medium term, there might be some negative impact on repair demand, just because cars are being driven at the moment. Have you guys done any work trying to figure out is that \u2013 could be the case, what to tell them that can be able to be a residual impact of the distance not just related to \u2013 Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think \u2013 look, I think \u2013 like I said, I think a couple of things I can tell you, first of all trucks are being repaired. I'm right in 94, I-94 out here, it seems like there's as many trucks on I-94 as it ever was. And it kind of makes sense, right? People are getting deliveries, maybe more deliveries now than before. So trucks are \u2013 while they \u2013 well, I'm sure that truck shops \u2013 because the lighter trucks, maybe are attenuated a lot of these trucks are still rolling. So I think that they're probably doing okay, continuing. You're talking about regular vehicles, like I said I think are monitoring and we get a pretty good monitor of this is that generally maintenance is drying up and repairs continuing at a somewhat reduced rate, but still at a reasonable rate. I would expect that after this starts to play out, you're going to get a rush on the garages with maintenance, there's going to be a snapback as maintenance tends to come like death and taxes. You need to have your oil changed every once in a while, so that's going to happen. Curtis Nagle : Okay, fair enough. Good luck to you guys and thanks. Nick Pinchuk : Alright, thanks a lot Curtis. Curtis Nagle : Take care. Operator : And we will take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Good morning, everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. David MacGregor : Nick, good morning. It's just a couple of questions on credit, I guess, we've got mid teens unemployment in this country, small businesses are on the ropes. The $500,000 provision seems a little light. I wonder although if you could just discuss the key assumptions that were underlying that your provision decision and particularly in light of the fact that you're calling the second half of March down double digits, which would have relatively negative implications for what might happen in the second quarter. We've got to understand some of the key assumptions underlying that provision decision. Aldo Pagliari : For sure, if you actually go Dave, remember, we're making our accounting adjustments effective at the end of the fiscal quarter, so that's March, so you have to keep that in mind as well and performance off the back of the van \u2013 performance for extended credit originations in general were pretty good. Yes, they were stronger at the beginning of the month than they were at the end of the month. But the performance was pretty good. And the performance of collection activity was pretty good. So it wasn't quite as good as Q1 of last year, which we actually saw lower levels of provisions in charge offs. But there was actually a better performance than what you would \u2013 had seen as a normal run rate. So we took that into account when we increase the reserve and then on top of it, we have to take a forward look, under CECL.  This gets to be a little bit more judgmental, certainly, because we've pressure tested the portfolio idea of circumstances of preparing for CECL's adoption. And actually, there's not any single variable that correlates so perfectly with it. So we look at a myriad of different things, and we have to apply some judgment. Having said all of that, we came to a conclusion that we thought it was appropriate to increase reserve by about $2.6 million. I'd say it's more specifically for the forward look. So it's not like it was nothing of dispensing the 500,000, just in reference to the sequential movement. But the CECL adjustment actually within the quarter was about 2.6 million and if you look at the level of reserves at the end of March as compared to the end of December, actually roughly 15% in total, so it's not like it's nothing. David MacGregor : Right, I guess just further on the credit. I didn't hear you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the 90 day payment deferral plan that began in March and we saw a rather parabolic upturn in UCC filings and I'm guessing although if you guys have you confirm it one way or the other if this was just technicians refinancing and franchisees rolling their IRA balances in DC? But can you just \u2013 I guess, under this 90 day deferral plan, how much forbearance has been granted at this point to end customers and franchisees? Aldo Pagliari : Well, people think first off the \u2013 its early days. It was launched on March 23. We've had programs like this before, so timing is even better with the advent of CECL, you could look at this as not at CECL with the COVID-19. So you can look at this as a form of being able to help customers out. But we've done programs like this in the past. So it's not like it's something radical in any way, shape or form. So we'll see what the uptake is. But as of the end of March, it was only in the in the field for about the less than seven days, I guess, given our fiscal cut off, I think was March 29, so you have that.  Now, you have a separate program, where we grant forbearance or can allow extensions to certain people that's on a case by case basis. It is for a limited number of weeks. We try to work \u2013 one thing I'd snap on this it's personal, and that's not a bad word. Some people shy away from the word personal these days with the pandemic, but we're pretty intimate with our customers and we know our customers, both our franchisees and they know their end mechanics and we have to reach out and help them, but it was a relatively small percentage. I think it will increase going into Q2, but geez, I think at the end of the quarter, it might have been less than 5% of people had asked for some type of forbearance if you want to use that word. David MacGregor : Right and so this originations growth of 1.2%, does that include refinancing of VC and revolving cash balances? And if so, can you say what originations growth might have been based purely on purchases of merchandise unrelated to the deferred payment offer? Aldo Pagliari : We measure origination to the same each and every quarter. It doesn't change because of what's going on. So extending credit can include both add-ons as well as sale of brand new products. But to be able to do so customers have to be in good standing. So in other words, if you want to add on to a contract, you've to be a customer that one has additional credit capacity, so we measure people's credit limits in that regard. And then it's got to be a minimum dollar sale in addition, which is typically I think, $300 and up. If you remember the cut off usually is more dollars than that, but that would be at least 300. So that's one of the determinants as to when people add on and add on to a contract they already have in place. David MacGregor : Right and finally, you mentioned you got $300 million left on your share repurchase authorization program, I guess with the stock haven't been sold off here rather hard. What would be your plans? Or how would you think about capital allocation here and maybe the priority of share purchase authorizations within that? Aldo Pagliari : Well, first and foremost, you want to support the ongoing operations. And that's kind of obvious. You're in a mode here where I think people will be careful with their cash. I think no one has perfect visibility when you look forward. So the forecast with precision is not easy in normal times, let alone rockier times. So you're going to want to keep an eye on cash inflows, and of course, cash outflows. And one of the more discretionary items actually would be share repurchase. When we look at share repurchase, I would put that on the list of one of the more discretionary items. So first and foremost, I look at what's the cash position to the corporation, and how does that fit into the equation. I thought that Snap-on was a great bargain at $150 per share is even a better bargain today. Does that mean I can't buy it at a lower price tomorrow? I just don't know with certainty, so again, we have to apply judgment. David MacGregor : Alright, well, thanks for taking the questions and good luck everyone. Aldo Pagliari : Thank you. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Sara Verbsky for any additional or closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snap-on.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.

Before we get going, I want to thank the members of the Snap-on team. It's clear in this turbulence that they are among the special contributors who keep society intact when our days are dark. And in that essential challenge, we're prioritizing the health, safety and well-being of our associates, franchisees, customers and communities. Working from home, and when that's not possible, and there's a number of those instances, distancing using personal protective equipment, cleaning, deep and often staggering shifts and brakes, paying quick attention to symptoms and pursuing contact tracing. We worked hard to stay safe. But throughout this time, we're also invested in - investing in a continuing stream of essential new products. We've also invested in a continuing stream of essential new products, reinforced our brand and strive to maintain our team. The people of Snap-on are a great advantage. We're working hard to preserve them in the turbulence, and we'll continue to do so. For our franchisees we're active in helping, reaching out on a regular basis to understand their needs and those of their customers. When the virus passes, we know there'll be even more opportunities. We want our associates and our franchisees at full strength to capitalize on the possibilities. We now project that the virus plays out in three phases : First, the initial shock. A substantial interruption of activity at both the franchisee and the customer level. This was evident in late March and in April; second, a combination period. As operations and individuals develop more and more ways to safely pursue their opportunities against the COVID-19 environment. In fact, we appear to be seeing that effect through May, June and onward. And of course, we've actively participated in that process, broadcasting best practices, working hard to accelerate the comeback. Finally, the third phase, psychological recovery. Following a return to normal, customers will need to regain confidence in the future before they resume full buying participation. And in that recovery, we see great opportunities. As driving is restored becomes even more popular, even more essential. This overall construct represents what we consider to be the general shape of the way forward. It does represent a continuing upward trend, but the slope of the ascension isn't clear. And of course, the psychological recovery phase will be greatly influenced by the ongoing evolution of the virus. Nobody knows the future for sure, but we are encouraged by what we've seen so far. Looking back, April was the nacre. But as the quarter progressed, we showed continual recovery. Our businesses did learn to better accommodate the pandemic. Both sales and profitability improved sequentially in May and in June. Although the virus is still with us, it appears that the situation may be evolving just as we projected. As we said at the end of April, the impact of COVID-19 varies across our operating landscape. Asia remains virus challenged. Japan, South Korea and China do appear to have weather the worst, but Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And in Europe, the overall economic weakness present before the pandemic in combination with the virus has made for the deepest distress of all. Beyond geographic differences, we're also seeing that our face-to-face businesses, the mobile vans and the direct sales forces are faring somewhat better compared with other models. Snap-on's traditional strength, personal selling appears to be an effective foundation for limiting the difficulty. In that way, we believe we have the resilience and resources to weather this challenge as Snap-on has so many times in the past. Actually, over the years, we've seen this movie before natural disaster, Superstorm Sandy, Hurricane, Harvey and Katrina and the Great Recession of 2009 and each time we learned to accommodate and emerge stronger and we've taken the lessons of those disruptions that apply them with positive effect to this time of the virus. I love to say this. Snap-on has paid a dividend every quarter since 1939 and it's never reduced it and this quarter was no different. That record stands as evidence of our ongoing resistance to challenge. And beyond just maintaining, we believe our continuing investment in new products and our franchisees and in our team in the midst of the storm will once again make us stronger as the environment recovers. We do believe in the opportunities going forward and because of that, we're keeping our focus on Snap-on value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement. That emphasis is particularly evident in customer connection and innovation. We're continuing with a stream of new products. We believe the green shoots of accommodation and psychological recovery will grow and we're going to be ready. Well, that's the overview. Now let's turn to the results. Second quarter, as reported sales were $724.3 million, down 23.9%, including $14.4 million or a 120-basis-point impact from unfavorable foreign currency and an organic sales declined 22.9%. From an earnings perspective, OpCo OI for the quarter of $91.1 million, including $5.8 million of direct costs associated with the virus, $4 million of restructuring, principally focused on Europe and $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $189.9 million in 2019. Optical operating margin was 12.6% and the as-adjusted level, excluding restructuring charges, was 13.1%. For financial services, operating income of $57.6 million was down from last year's 60.6%. Overall, EPS on an as-reported basis was $1.85 compared to compared to $3.22 last year. Excluding the restructuring charges the as-adjusted EPS was $1.91. Well, those are the overall numbers. Now let's turn to the groups. In C&I, volume in the second quarter of $261.9 million including $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency, was down versus last year's $335 million, primarily on double-digit declines in all of the segment's operations, reflecting the effect of COVID-19 operations, and the ongoing economic weakness in Europe. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $22.9 million decreased $26 million, including $3 million of virus related of costs, $2 million of restructuring and $1.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects. There was a clear point of light in C&I. Our direct sales to customers in the critical industries, though still down was less effective than other areas across the group. Military and international aviation continue to register growth. And heavy truck, as you might expect was down, but was reasonably resilient while other segments such as oil and gas and education, no surprise. There were no students. Both those industries were significantly impacted by the pandemic and experienced substantial contraction. But we do remain confident in and committed to extending in the critical industries, and we do see growing opportunity there moving forward. Speaking in the future, let's talk about creating new products. Just this quarter, we introduced another one of our great 14.4 volt units. The new CTS 825 quarter inch Hex Hex Cordless screw driver. Our brushless powertrain makes for higher torque, more run time, longer motor life. The driver as a nine-position clutch giving text just a proper amount of torque for the job, all packaged with a dual range gearbox and a built-in break that prevent this power tool from throwing fasteners that's a significant safety feature. The new screw gun also features ergonomically designed cush grip handle for great tech comfort and twin lights, twin LED lights to clearly illuminate the work area. After only a couple of months, it's already essential where work is critical. It was launched in April, a tough month. But it's already one of our hit million dollar products, a significant success. C&I, navigating the turbulence of customer connection and innovation serving the essentials, now on to the Tools Group. Sales were $323.3 million in the quarter, reflecting a $79.2 million organic decline and $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign unfavorable foreign unfavorable foreign currency. The operating earnings were $38.4 million, including $1.9 million of virus-related costs, $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency and $600,000 of restructuring charges compared to $71.3 million recorded in 2019. The Tools Group was a clear demonstration both of the COVID trajectory across our business and of the strength and resilience of our direct face-to-face model. As the virus rose in late March and April, the network was shocked individually and collectively. The impact varied by region, but all geographies were affected. April was the deepest. However, moving from that point, our franchisees in collaboration with the Snap-on team file increasingly effective ways to accommodate the pandemic and pursue their support of the essential. And each subsequent month, the vans have shown significant gains. In fact, the Tools Group sales in June were down just 3.1%, up nicely after a tough start to the quarter. The ongoing accommodation, you hear from the field that the direct interface with our customers is dramatically highlighting the bun that Snap-on has always had with working men and women through thick and thin. And many franchisees report that the relationship forged to new and the pandemic have never been stronger. There's nothing like working together in difficulty, and we believe this bodes really well for our market position and for capturing future opportunities. So despite the virus, we're still quite positive about our business, and as a view clearly reflected outside Snap. And in fact, once again, this year, we're being recognized in the top 50 of entrepreneurs Magazine's annual best of the best franchisee -- franchises. The entrepreneur ranking rates 500 companies on cost, size, growth, franchise support, brand power, financial strength and organizational stability. And we again scored highest in the Tool Distribution category. That's a distinction we've held for quite some time. As we move forward, our associates and franchisees are clearly becoming more effective against the win, it\u2019s a continuing process born out of the Snap-on team working and developing action plans, sharing best practices for safe selling, supporting with tailored promotions and launching targeted promotions. This is a process that's been successful in hurricanes, recessions and the threats of 9/11, and it's working again. And of course, the effort includes also a healthy array of innovative new products to solve the critical. Everybody knows we have great ratchets. And guided by uninterrupted customer connection, we've been expanding that powerful line-up. Almost every quarter, and we did it again when we introduced the XFR704 12-point Flank Drive Double Flex Ratcheting Box Wrench Set. Now that's a mouthful. But this unit has a lot to offer. It combines 180-degree flexible head with our narrow width and low-height design, allowing work in the tightest of spaces. Our patented ratcheting gear utilizes Dual 80 technology, minimizing swing arc and making jobs in restricted areas even easier. And our unique Yoke/tang configuration provides the strongest and most durable flex head anywhere. The new four-piece set is built in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant right here in USA. I was just there again, and I can testify. The Snap-on people in that plant are a special team turning out great product, and even in the current environment that technicians have noticed, driving the Flex to 704 on its way to be another $1 million product. Well, that's the Tools Group, accommodating the pandemic, furthering innovation and strengthening for the future. Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I group finished the quarter with $245 million in sales, including $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency, $2.3 million from recent acquisitions and that level compared to $348.9 million recorded last year. The lower volumes reflected a decline of over 30% and the activity associated with vehicle OEM projects and in the capital like spending relating to our undercar equipment operations, both areas that were deeply attenuated with the uncertainty. Sales of diagnostics and repair information products, independent shops were also negatively impacted, but to a lesser degree, garages continue to subscribe. And invest in meeting new repair challenges, people's need fixing even in a pandemic. RS&I operating earnings of $50.6 million decreased $38 million, including $1.4 million of European focused restructuring, $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency and $700,000 of direct COVID costs. So while the overall group was impacted, information-based operations were not as effective and new products were a driver in that. Once again, we generated repair excitement with innovations like the latest enhancements to our Mitchell One prodemand repair information system, which in response to the needs of large national account customers now includes a range of vehicle lift points in its quick reference menu. The new pro menu links directly to vivid vehicle illustrations, which identify designated listing points as well as listing all the important manufacturer recommended safety procedures. You see technicians are in a hurry, sometimes fail to follow the correct lift procedures. Injuries and vehicle damage can follow. But those who have our pro demand system can now find the critical lift information only one click away from the home screen. It's a significant convenience and a clear safety enhancement. Also in the quarter, we launched our e-Technician 2.0 designed specifically for heavy-duty trucks. It's the most comprehensive and powerful diagnostic software in the market. It provides the data and the support required to stay competitive in today's trucking industries. Heavy-duty diagnosis were never this good. The e-technician 2.0 combines extensive coverage from everything from commercial vehicles to write-down to light and medium heavy-duty trucks, diagnostic capability for an expanded array of engines, transmissions, brakes, body and chassis systems and more. The new 2.0 also adds a cloud-based, fleet-wide vehicle history, giving users access to every diagnostic session for every vehicle in their fleet, regardless of location. Snap-on continues to show the way in truck repair and e-technician 2.0 is another step along that path. We're confident in the strength of our RS&I group. And we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. Well, that's the second quarter, the Snap-on second quarter. Shack, moving to accommodation into what we believe will be psychological recovery, keeping our teams safe as we pursue the essential, applying the lessons of our experience, helping our customers, our franchisees and our team, whether the difficult days. And build the capability, whether those days and build the capability to operate in the virus environment, driving month-by-month improvement, engaging the power of our direct selling capabilities, being confident in our future opportunities now amplified by the virus, pursuing Snap-on value creation, all to not only weather the turbulence, but to emerge stronger and ready to take full advantage when the days are clear. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo for a detailed discussion of the financials. Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $724.3 million in the quarter compared to $951.3 million last year, reflecting a 22.9% organic sales decline, $14.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation and $2.3 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic sales decrease primarily reflected the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with sales declines in all three operating segments. In the quarter, while there was some variability from location to location, the declines in Europe were more pronounced. As anticipated, with government measures in place throughout the world, sales in the month of April were heavily impacted and were down significantly on a year-over-year basis. As locations began to reopen and as our operations and those of our franchisees adjusted to the virus environment, which included accommodations for various government-imposed restrictions, we began to see sequential improvements in activity as we move through May and June. Similar to last quarter, we accrued for restructuring costs associated with certain of our European-based operations. During the second quarter, we recorded $4 million of such cost which were reflected in each of our operating segments. Additionally in the quarter, we've identified $5.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID 19. These costs include direct labor and under-absorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantine associates, event cancellation fees as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. Consolidated gross margin of 47.1% compared to 49.8% last year. The 270 basis point decrease primarily reflects the impact of the lower volumes, including costs to maintain manufacturing capacity and worker skill sets, 40 basis points of direct cost associated with COVID-19 and 30 basis points of restructuring costs. The decreases were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 34.5% increased 470 basis points from 29.8% last year. This increase primarily reflects the impact of lower sales as well as 40 basis points of direct COVID-19 related costs and 20 basis points from restructuring actions. These items were partially offset by savings from cost containment actions in response to the lower volume. Operating earnings before financial services of $91.1 million, including $5.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19, $4 million of restructuring costs and $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $189.9 million in 2019. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 12.6% compared to 20% last year. Excluding the restructuring charges, operating earnings before financial services of $95.1 million or 13.1% of sales, decreased 49.9% from 2019 levels. Financial services revenue of $84.6 million in the second quarter of 2020 compared to $84.1 million last year, while operating earnings of $57. 6 million compared to $60.6 million in 2019, primarily reflecting a $3 million increase in provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $148.7 million, including $5.8 million of direct COVID related costs, $4 million of restructuring charges and $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $250.5 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 18.4% compares to 24.2% last year. On an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring, operating earnings of $152.7 million or 18.9% of revenues decreased 39% from 2019 levels. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 24.1%, including a 20 basis point increase from the restructuring charges compared to 23.6% for the second quarter of last year. Finally, net earnings of $101.2 million or $1.85 per share, including a $0.06 charge for restructuring compared to $180.4 million or $3.22 per share a year ago. Excluding the restructuring charges, net earnings as adjusted were $104.5 million or $1.91 per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on slide seven. Sales of $261.9 million compared to $335 million last year, reflecting a 20.22% organic sales decline and a $6.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease includes mid-teen declines in both sales to customers in critical industries and in the power tools operation. Across the critical industries, gains in sales to various government-related agencies were more than offset by declines in natural resources, including oil and gas, as well as the lower technical education sales with the latter being impacted by school and campus closures. Gross margin of 34.4% decreased 420 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of decreased sales, including lower utilization of manufacturing capacity, as well as 80 basis points from $2 million of restructuring charges, 70 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These decreases were partially offset by material cost savings and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 25.7% increased 170 basis points from 24% last year, primarily due to the lower sales and 50 basis points of direct COVID-19 related costs. These items were partially offset by savings from cost containment efforts. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $22.9 million, including $3 million of direct COVID-19 related cost, $2 million of restructuring charges and $1.9 million of unfavorable foreign currencies effects compared to $48.9 million last year. The operating margin of 8.7%, including the 80 basis point charge for restructuring compared to 14.6% a year ago. Turning now to slide eight. Sales in the Snap-on Tools group of $323.3 million compared to $405.8 million in 2019, reflecting a 19.7% organic sales decline and $3.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease reflects a mid-teen decline in our US franchise operations and a nearly 40% decline in the segment's international operations. As Nick mentioned, sales in our direct customer-facing businesses like the Snap-on Tools had the most dramatic year-over-year decreases in April, with notable sequential improvements in activity in May and June. Gross margin of 41.7% declined 340 basis points, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volumes, including cost to maintain manufacturing capacity as well as 30 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19, and there were 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 29.8% increased from 27.5% last year, primarily due to the impact of the lower sales, 30 basis points of direct COVID-19 related costs and 20 basis points from $600,000 of restructuring charges. These costs were partially offset by savings from cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools group of $38.4 million, including $1.9 million of direct COVID-19 related costs, $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $600,000 of restructuring charges compared to $71.3 million last year. The operating margin of 11.9% compared to 17.6% a year ago. Turning to the RS&I group shown on slide nine. Sales of $245 million compared to $348.9 million a year ago, reflecting a 29.5% organic sales decline and $4.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $2.3 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic sales decline includes a mid-teens decrease in sales of diagnostic and information products to independent repair shop owners and managers as well as declines of over 30% in both sales of undercar equipment and sales to OEM dealerships. The lower sales of undercar equipment includes significantly lower sales of collision repair products, while lower sales to OEM dealerships largely reflect decreases in OEM facilitation projects. Gross margin of 47.4% improved 110 basis points from 46.3% last year primarily due to the impact of reduced sales and lower gross margin businesses and savings from RCI activities. The operating expense margin of 26.7% increased from 20.9% last year, primarily due to the lower sales and 50 basis points from $1.4 million of restructuring charges partially offset by savings from RCI and other cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the RS& I group of $50.6 million, including $1.4 million of restructuring charges, $700,000 of direct COVID-19 related costs and $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $88.6 million last year. The operating margin of 20.7% compared to 25.4% a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $84.6 million compared to $84.1 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $57.6 million compared to $60.6 million in 2019. Financial services expenses of $27 million increased $3.5 million from last year's levels, primarily due to $3 million of higher provisions for credit losses as compared to 2019. The second quarter of 2019 included lower provisions as a result of non-recurring favorable loss experience at that time. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.3% and 1.1% in the second quarters of 2020 and 2019 respectively. The average yield on finance receivables was 17.6% in the second quarters of both 2020 and 2019. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.2% and 9.1%. The lower yield on contract receivables in the second quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the impact of approximately $20 million of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. Total loan originations of $255.8 million decreased $7.6 million or 2. 9% and included an 8.5% decrease in originations of finance receivables. This decline in finance receivables was partially offset by a 26.1% increase in originations of contract receivables resulting from the business operations support loans offered to franchisees mentioned earlier. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $54.3 million in the second quarter. Collections of finance receivables in the quarter of $166.8 million compared to collections of $191.6 million during the second quarter of 2019. This year's quarter reflected the greater use of deferred payment plan sales programs and short-term payment relief or forbearance to some of our franchisees qualifying customers. Similar to the trends elsewhere in our business, we saw the greatest number of requests for payment relief on extended credit or finance receivables in April. This lessened in May, and as of the end of June, forbearance was granted for approximately 2.5% of the portfolio. Historically, those accounts having forbearance terms are below 1% of the finance receivable portfolio. Trailing 12-month net losses on extended credit or finance receivables of $50.4 million represented 2.93% of outstandings at quarter end, down six basis points sequentially. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1% for U.S. extended credit is down 40 basis points from a year ago. This improvement primarily reflects the aforementioned programs, which took place during the quarter as well as the effective credit and collection practices executed by Snap-on and our franchisees throughout this period. Total charge-offs within the quarter totaled $15.1 million as compared to $14.9 million during the second quarter of 2019. Now, turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $253.6 million in the quarter increased $108.1 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including $61.5 million in lower tax payments, $75.7 million in decreases in working investment, partially offset by lower net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $45.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $35 million and capital expenditures of $11.8 million. In the quarter, our total free cash flow or cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures in the net change in finance receivables was $206.8 million. This reflected an improvement of $118.3 million from last year and represented 195% of net earnings. Net cash provided by financing activities of $289.5 million included the proceeds from the April sale of $500 million of 30-year senior notes, partially offset by $148.1 million of repayments of notes payable and other short-term borrowings and cash dividends of $58.7 million. While there were no repurchases of common stock under our existing share repurchase programs during the quarter. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $334.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables decreased $131.1 million from 2019 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 59 days compared to 67 days at 2019 year-end. This reflected a reduction in days outstanding across all of our operating segments. Inventories increased $23.6 million from 2019 year-end, primarily to support the critical industries. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3 compared to 2.6 at year-end 2019. Our quarter end cash position of $686.2 million compared to $184.5 million at year-end 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 17.9% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no outstanding amounts under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Despite the uncertainty in the current environment, we believe we have sufficient available cash and access to both committed and uncommitted credit facilities to cover expected funding needs in both the near-term and a long-term basis. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few updated outlook items. Given the improving trends experienced in the second quarter in the near-term, we believe there will be continued sequential improvements reflecting increasing levels of accommodations to the virus-related environment. However, we cannot provide assurance on the rate of progress due to the uncertain and evolving nature and duration of the pandemic. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $75 million to $85 million as compared to our prior estimate of $70 million to $80 million. Additionally, we continue to anticipate that our full year 2020 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 25%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-on second quarter, sales were down. Of course, we don't like it. But - the OpCo margin was 12.6%, 13.1% as adjusted, approaching the mid-teen level that we long-held as an aspirational target. EPS of $1.91 as adjusted, also down but still higher than any quarter before the end of 2014. The numbers are decreased, but we believe they demonstrated significant resilience and perhaps the greatest withering of our time. You see we have seen this movie before. That -- and that experience helped guide us through the depth of the shock and on to the continuing positive trajectory of accommodation. April is dark. But the rise from that point was of evident across the corporation from operation to operation. The tools group demonstrating the value of our direct model with sales in June reaching within 3.1% of last year's level. The future is not known. What we believe our learning and accommodation assures that we won't get shocked again and any future impact will be attenuated. And looking at the way the virus has affected everyday life, we believe abundant opportunities emerging for Snap - are emerging for Snap-on in the recovery. It appears that vehicles are going to be even more important. You can see already in China and in the U.S. Northeast, and that's music to our ears. And we are preparing launching new products, enhancing our brand, reinforcing our franchise network and maintaining the capabilities of our team. Now all of this represents a cost in the turbulence, but it ensures that we'll be fully enabled and stronger when the opportunities arise. And we believe what we're doing in these days of the virus will position Snap-on for continuing growth, increasing profitability and ongoing prosperity for years to come. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I once again -- I'll once again speak to our Franchisees & Associates. It has never been clearer that all of you are extraordinary people, playing a very special role in our world. For your ongoing success in surviving the shock and accommodating the turbulence, you have my congratulations for your significant contributions in maintaining our society, you have my admiration. And for your unfailing belief in the future of our enterprise, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Certainly. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Scott Stember with C.L. King. Scott Stember : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Scott. Scott Stember : Nick, you gave a lot of good color on what's happening at recovery within the businesses. It seems like the Tools Group is probably experiencing the greatest recovery. Maybe talk about RS&I and C&I, how the cadence of sales recovery and how we could expect the quarter coming up. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Well, look, of course, we don't give guidance, but I'll tell you that's generally, of course, - what I say is never true everywhere in Snap-on, of course. But generally, we're seeing a combination across the vast majority of our operations, April, May, June, there was a progression of improvement through those periods. So don't get me wrong, the fact that I called out the Tools group, because they had done particularly well. There was a combination across every one of those groups. So, that's particularly in industrial, where - I called out the direct selling. They had some nice progression through that period in their direct selling activity. If you step back to -- and I think you would say across C&I, in general, you're seeing that. In RS&I, the sales were down, what were they down? Like 29.8% as reported, 29.5% or 29.4% as adjusted. But generally, you see a couple of pieces. One, the vehicle OEM projects are quite lumpy, and we see that in this period, and it's very hard to project that future and the equipment business, which generally is selling - after all selling to kind of a bifurcated situation they're selling to small businesses, which need psychological recovery to have the confidence to invest in the capital-light projects, which are our equipment. Now, the other piece of what I've just talked about is, there's a big dollop associated with the OEM and really that comes psychological view of the dealerships. Do they think the fact that maybe they're going to sell new cars - less new cars this year means they should pull in their horns, or as in other times, should they start investing, because they had need to depend more and more on used car and repair and parts flow? If it's the latter, there should be an uptick in those businesses. Scott Stember : Got it. And moving over to the financial services side, your originations were really not down all that much. But I guess that was explained by loans to the franchisees. Maybe just talk about the health of the franchisees and what you're seeing at the repair shop level. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Look, I was just out with some franchisees last week, and they seem pretty strong. I mean, and I talked to a lot of them on the phone these days since I can't travel as much as I used to around the country. And they seem all quite positive. I would say that the originations - one of the things I will tell you that I think speaks volumes is we talked about the recovery, the accommodation of the Tools Group as shown in the 3.1%. Well, I'll tell you that in the quarters through this period, the sales off the van could be viewed as our work better than our sales to the bands. So fundamentally, what you see a little bit in that origination situation is some of our franchisees selling out of their inventory, big-ticket items, particularly tool storage, which they tend to happen in and inventory to try to accommodate the taste of the technicians. And therefore, you see that, but we see it as a great thing. Because fundamentally, the sales off the van are outpacing. The sales of the Tools Group showed a combination. Scott Stember : So that being said, the sale in June, if you were down only modestly sell in, are you saying you were off the van in June? Nick Pinchuk : I didn't say anything. I said it was better than the 3.1. That's what I said. I said it was better than the -- I think -- and I said significantly better. But that's what I'm willing to say in this situation. It clearly is what leads to the originations. Scott Stember : Got it. Good enough. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And now we'll take a question from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hey, Good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Hi, Gary. Gary Prestopino : A couple of questions here, Nick. First of all, you -- well, first of all, are all your markets now open, especially on the van side, I mean, are you able to sell in the Northeast some of these areas\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Oh, yes. Everything is open. It was -- there's a lot less variation now in terms of opening. When the virus hits, the shock hit, there was variations between regions. So the Northeast, you have a lot of people with attenuated activity, not as much say Southwest, as we\u2019re talking about the swap between, not as much, but still attenuation. Now they've kind of come together. Canada, I don't know if I talked on the call, but Canada was like the basket case for a while. People were really shocked and U.K. was shocked and all of those businesses have -- all of those areas have started to come together. There is some arithmetic difference between them, but not enough to shake a stick at, I think, in this situation. So the guys are coming back. Now that's happened through the quarter at varying levels, part of the accommodation process. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then you keep mentioning or you mentioned opportunities for your company, given this COVID-19 situation. I mean, are those opportunities really stemming from the fact that cars are getting older and that also thought process or the thematic thought process is that more individuals are going to want to own cars rather than taking public transportation. Are there other areas where you're looking on to capitalize that you didn't really talk about? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think those are the two big things, I'm talking about. But I think as -- I think a couple of things. I think -- I would say three things. One, of course, cars are getting older. They've gotten older every year. And the fact that it's a lower SAAR this year, probably cars will accelerate in terms of getting older, we think. And so that's one thing and that does keep driving. Cars keep changing and so the virus is kind of frozen people in. And so we expect to see a few slot of new technologies closed now, and then that drives our situation. Secondly, I think you and I don't want to get on the L to go down in Chicago. I don't think people are going to want to jump on a subway so much anymore and -- or at least depend on that. And so what we see in China, and we start to see that in the Northeast has increased driving, because people don't want to depend on collective transportation, because they know that things can go wrong in the situation. On top of which, if you read commercial real estate and cities are going down and I think residential real estate, I think people are moving out for the suburbs, and that means more driving. And finally, we think that this kind of pause gives more time for new technologies like advanced driver assistance systems, which change a lot of things and play right into our more complicated product and maybe even more electric vehicles, which changes the car park and helps us sell more tools. We have a kit that we've especially made, 53 tools just for electric vehicles. So when they roll out, we'll be ready to roll with them. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then my last question, if you want to answer this. I'm just trying to get an idea. I mean, you said that sequentially, there was an improvement in sales throughout the quarter. Are you still seeing \u2013 did you still see a sequential improvement at the early part of Q3. I realize the seasonality there. Nick Pinchuk : We don't give guidance. And look, Q3 is a squarely quarter. However, so therefore, you've got vacations in Europe. You got the SFC, you got a lot of things floating through there. However, I did say, May, June onwards, that's about what I'm willing to say. Gary Prestopino : Okay. That\u2019s fine. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : And next, we have Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Nick, just to press on your willingness tolerance there a little bit more. Was the May-June onward dynamic for RS&I and C&I material or negligible? Nick Pinchuk : Material. I mean it's \u2013 but look, I don't want to get overheated on these kinds of things. Everybody \u2013 I said already that nobody knows how the future is going to go. But what I did say is we are stronger against this kind of disruption by virtue of the accommodation, and we don't believe we will get shocked again. So if the world rises, maybe we bow it a little bit more. I \u2013 we expect \u2013 we're saying we saw that onward motion, And I think implicit, and accommodation is we get better and better at dealing with the environment. The shape of the curve is unclear. And I've already said the third quarter is. But we \u2013 like I said also, I like what I see. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And then you've had some restructuring. You may have some temporary cost actions going away. Is there a way to think about sequential leverage on whatever uptick we choose to model? Nick Pinchuk : Well, we have had restructuring because it was in \u2013 it's mostly focused on Europe. I think six-tenth of this times $4 million is kind of in North America and the two, or not necessarily. It's kind of European focused, we'd say, mostly in general. We'd say that because while we saw \u2013 we've been watching Europe evolved for a while and seeing the weakness of the economics. So we've been prepared for this and raising through RCI or capacity. So we can deal with higher volumes with less in Europe. That's why we have this restructuring. I would say this only. There's a lot, I think, implicit, and we saying we are investing in products, enhancing our brand and maintaining our team. That means we're holding the people because we actually believe that our people are capable. And I don't know about other people, but we think these people are hard to duplicate. So we're holding on to them for dear life. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And last one for me. On SFC, I'm wondering if it's \u2013 some of the charge-offs were relatively light in the quarter, considering all that's going on. You talked about some consolidations. Are there any implications for the back half, did some of the mechanical calc of provisioning kind of get deferred in this dynamic? Or is it kind of a more continuity? Nick Pinchuk : Look\u2026 Christopher Glynn : Yes, just wanted to know about the financial performance to... Nick Pinchuk : I'll just say this, Chris. I feel better now than I did in the prior call in April. I feel better now. And I'll let Aldo comment. Aldo Pagliari : Yes. Chris, I'd just say that just to refresh everyone's memory, Q2 typically does see seasonal improvement as you progress from Q1. It's a period of time when people get their tax refunds, and obviously, we probably got a little bit of a bump up with stimulus checks coming in. But a reminder, not everybody got their tax refund yet because if you didn't submit your tax return electronically, you're still probably have it being reviewed the IRS. So there might be some tailwind that still occurs in Q3 from tax refunds. Having said that, the deferred payment programs forbearance they help a bit with the calculation, so if you look at the progress from Q1 to Q2, normally, we expect a 10 to 20 basis point sequential improvement. This time, we saw 70 and year-over-year, it was better by 40. I'd say, if you look year-over-year, there's probably 20, 30 basis points associated with the fact that you have deferred programs. So by definition customers on deferral couldn't be delinquent. So that will go away a bit. So I think you'll get more traditional levels. But geez, it looks a lot like a natural disaster from our history in the rearview mirror so far. So we'll see how the remainder plays out. It's still a pretty volatile environment. But like I said, we're pleased with the charge-offs in the quarter. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Operator : And now we'll go to David MacGregor of Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everybody. Nick Pinchuk : Hi, David. David MacGregor : Good morning. I wondered just for the sake of clarity rather than trying to fumble through a bunch of numbers, but just for the sake of clarity, can you just say what the originations would have been excluding the loans to the franchisees? Aldo Pagliari : Well, the contract receivables were up 26% in the quarter. So that's clearly broken out, if at contract receivables. So as Nick has mentioned, EEC was down 8.5%, David. David MacGregor : Right. All right. Maybe I'll take that up with the off line. I just want to make sure we're getting to an accurate number here. And then can you quantify the extent of the return from\u2026 Aldo Pagliari : To make it easy, the loans to the franchisees has nothing to do with EC. It has nothing to do with EC at all. So the EC originations\u2026 David MacGregor : I understand that. I I'll take it up with the off line, if that's okay. Returns, I wonder if you could quantify the extent of the returns in the quarter and the extent, I know they're treated as a contra revenue account. So the extent to which they were a headwind for Tools Group organic growth? Aldo Pagliari : I don't think there was anything notable in the quarter in that regard. I mean, I - from our perspective, it was just a regular quarter in terms of the returns, which we tend to look at. So I mean, I think that our guys didn't necessarily flush a lot back into the system more than they do in any regular quarter, there's some back and forth. But that didn't affect things in this situation. Nick Pinchuk : Our franchisees, we think, are in pretty good shape. David MacGregor : Well, I guess that was my next question is just, I mean... Aldo Pagliari : No, I think the thing is some people might think franchisees are on hold or things like that, but that's not -- it's not really -- actually, there's a record for this all-time loan. David MacGregor : And could you clarify that for me, the record, what's the\u2026 Aldo Pagliari : Yes, it was the number of franchisees that are not paying, that are direct, they get to be on hold. For the record there... David MacGregor : In that combination\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Parents came way down at the end of the quarter. David MacGregor : Okay. And then, I guess, overall, I wanted to ask about franchisee creditworthiness because this whole slowdown in mid-April came right after the regional kickoffs when you guys would have had a really high level of inventory, which makes it a little surprising to hear that you didn't see any kind of inflection in returns. But that being the case, how do you feel about credit worthiness overall right now? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I \u2013 we think \u2013 actually, we think they're in pretty good shape. I mean, the sales off the van are, I think when you look at them from a year-over-year point of view and you look at them for this situation, they describe what I talked about in terms of shock accommodation. And as I said, they are pacing ahead of the Tools Group. So that's a pretty positive from a quantitative point of view. From a qualitative point of view when you talk to a broad group of them, you get \u2013 you kind of get some very positive feedback in terms of, of course, I'm the CEO. So maybe I do get feedback. But you hear experiences and when I'm in the garages, the garages seem to be working. Yeah, technicians dipped in the shock, but they came sort of pretty back, pretty quickly and the garages are humming, every garage I was at, the parking lot from garage was marked. David MacGregor : Do you think there's going to be any need for any route consolidation? Nick Pinchuk : No, I don't think so. But you look at everything, David, but I don't think so. I don\u2019t think so. David MacGregor : Last question for me is just on the operating expenses. You had a little bit of a pullback here, a reaction. So I guess, congratulations on that. But I'm guessing a large measure of that may have been associated with the volume reductions. So I guess the question is, if we end up with W-shape recovery rather than the V shape that you seem to be assuming, what's the opportunity to take more out of the SG&A and the operating expense line going forward? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look, I think first of all \u2013 first of all, I don't know what you call travel volume-related or not. I mean, I'm not sure it's so volume related, but you can travel and a lot of different things. And in other words, you have some reductions in this interim while you keep \u2013 while you do things, for example, you're not renting a hall or putting on a meal when you bring, you're not people together on a zoom situation. Now it's maybe not as effective, but the thing is you do work on that. So it's not all volume related. And I think I\u2019ve already said though, that we\u2019re determined to maintain our franchisees, maintain our brand, invest in new product and keep our team intact and I would suggest that we see that going forward because we believe we have great opportunities going forward. So my principal view \u2013 my principle approach to this is \u2013 our principal approach is to weather the storm, and I think we're doing that pretty good, given the levels of where we are and you look at the cash flows, I mean, the absolute numbers of the returns and then come out stronger because we're pretty sure we're going to have big opportunities. So if it's not an upward slope -- if it's not an upward slope, if it dips down some, we won't get shocked again. We'll get over it. It will come out stronger. David MacGregor : Just one last quick one, if I could. You mentioned that record low credit holds for franchisees. Is that due to an increase in franchisee attrition? Nick Pinchuk : No, no. Operator : And we'll go on to our next question\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : We talk of percentage\u2026 Operator : And next question will come from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Hi, Bret. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Bret Jordan : A question on inventory, I guess. You commented that turns were down to 2.3 times to support critical industries. And I guess the longer-term trend has gone from north of 4% to north of 2%. Is there something structurally different in the working capital model? Or what you're committing to for the critical industry customers as far as holding inventory? And I guess, can you give us sort of an idea what kind of product profile this is that's building in the inventory? Aldo Pagliari : Yes, Bret. Aldo. Certainly, we are continuously adding products that cater to the critical industry. There is unique requirements. Sometimes they're lower volumes, so it doesn't have the same level of addition as when a new product introduced to the Tools Group. But if you want to be a serious player in oil and gas and natural resources and aviation, there are certainly unique products that do not sell into the mechanic space that you have to have there. So we've been doing that as well. In addition, there's a lot of projects that we call kitting activity and that array in kitting activity, as an example, you might have 100 different items in the kit. As you stage it as you prepare for it, it requires higher levels of inventory as you prep and wait for other incoming items because not everything comes from a Snap-on facility. Oftentimes, the military or an aviation customer might like certain things that do not come from Snap-on, and they want that kitted in a rate with a tool storage cabinet that we might prepare for them, and we have a variety of different products that do that. And therefore, accommodating those requests forced us to expand both floor space and inventory when it comes to these things and we like that business. Bret Jordan : Okay. Is there sort of a target turns number, I guess, ex-COVID, where the sales obviously evaporated, but is there a ballpark we should be shooting for as far as that number? Aldo Pagliari : We think it could be better. We don't have an exact target that I'm going to delineate here today, but we think it could be better. I mean, obviously, the current situation puts a depressant on turnover tactics. But we've been getting a pretty good return on our inventory and in a low interest rate environment, we're more than willing to make investments in inventory, if we truly believe it will generate incremental sales. Nick Pinchuk : We don't see inventory necessarily as an independent variable, but we like to see a return on it. If we get a return on it, we're happy. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then one question, I guess, the franchise event that usually is held in August, I assume, is probably not as a live. Are you going to do anything sort of virtually? Or would there any be sales promotion to offset what would have been the get together? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, we have an event. We're going to call live from the forge -- from the our IdeaForge here in Kenosha. And so we're going to go through a virtual event, trying to create the selling opportunity the ability to see new products and different -- in different forms like franchisees would get when they journey to places like Florida and went through the football field, so we'll have that. And so we won't have it in August, we'll have it coming up. We will happen in August, probably at the same time. But it's kind of geared at giving the franchisees a similar opportunity from a new product point of view. From a product ordering point of view, unfortunately, we won't be able to get as much of the training or the, I guess, the cultural bonding that occurs at the other franchisees. But we're going to have event that replaces it. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Operator : And now we'll go to Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners. Ivan Feinseth : All right. Thank you for taking my questions. How are you guys doing? Nick Pinchuk : Safe. Ivan Feinseth : The average age of the vehicles on the road have now touched to a record high of almost 12 years. Do you track that to see -- I mean, when vehicles age? Are you selling more tools or when new car sales are increasing, which would be down the average age? Nick Pinchuk : We don't have a direct relationship to new car sales. It's the aging of the vehicles, and it's the changing of the vehicles that drives our requirements. We can be indirectly affected by a downturn. And what are they going to sell? $12 million this year, $11.5 million, which is a downturn. And the psychological impact on dealerships and the OEMs themselves can ripple through some of that project business or some of the willingness of the dealerships to embark on capital projects. But it isn't a direct relationship, where aging of the vehicles and the new technologies in the vehicles, our direct relationships, requiring technicians to deal with either more volume or newer types of systems where they have to have different tools. Ivan Feinseth : And then one of the amazing things in the pandemic is that the CEO from Polaris said earlier in the week that they are experiencing unprecedented demand for off-road vehicles and motorcycles. I mean this has, shockingly, I guess, created -- sales are on fire for all kinds of like wave runners and ATVs and side-by-side and even motorcycles, and even though Harley had a tough quarter, I think they're going to turn and they'll see strength as well. How do you or franchisees penetrate the mechanics in that area? Also, in a number of those places, they have a shortage of mechanics. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. I think there's been a shortage of mechanics in a lot of places for a long time. I think the deal is that they're graduating 77,000 a year from technical schools, and they need $105,000 a year by retirement. So there has been a shortage, and so we have to -- it's been for some time. So you try to get that. Our people are in \u2013 our franchisees are in some of those places. But these are the advantages we think we \u2013 the opportunities we think we have. We say there's 1.3 million technicians in the United States and we only call on 850,000 of them. And some of those are the places like the off-road vehicles, where we may not get to. And so we have an opportunity. We think coming out of this, we've got tremendous opportunities, particularly if you're saying that people turn to, instead of going to -- instead of maybe taking more collective transportation, turn to RVs and other things. We think this is good for us, and the fact that we're confident. Ivan Feinseth : RV sales are on fire, ATV sales are on fire, everybody -- all kinds of personal transportation. Used car sales have been on fire. New car sales, the factories were shut down for a while because of the pandemic, but I'm sure that, that will pick up. So yes, I think people who are going to move away from cities, if they work at home then they don't have to be near cities, they can be anywhere, and then I think that will drive the need for personal transportation, cars, boats, ATVS, recreational type of stuff. So is there going to be a focus on developing specific tools for those types of vehicles? And then one last question, you have\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : That's right. Ivan Feinseth : 53 specific tools for EVs. Can you give us some idea of what specific EV tool would be? Nick Pinchuk : Well, a lot of them would be -- a great category would be, we call them insulating tools. You poke yourself -- you poke around underneath an electric car, you level up fry yourself. So we have -- these are tools, which specifically create insulation between the point of contact and the user. And so we have an array of those, which we think will be very efficacious in this situation. And so I think they're going to be used. And then we have other tools as well that deal with the specific mechanism under an electric vehicle car -- an electric vehicle. But we think -- you point out, you just point there's all these opportunities for us. Change is our friend, and we think change is coming in this situation. Ivan Feinseth : I love it. Thanks again. Stay well. Nick Pinchuk : Good to hear from you. Ivan Feinseth : Good to talk with you. You too. Nick Pinchuk : Take care. Operator : And now that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back to Sara Verbsky for any additional or closing comments. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. We'd like to thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with the highlights of our third quarter. I'll give you a perspective on how the virus environment is playing out and on the trends that we see today and going forward. And I'll speak on our physical and financial progress. And Aldo will provide a more detailed review of the financials. We see the third quarter as another encouraging period, the metrics clearly confirm Snap-on\u2019s resilience, showing the ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, moving from the initial shock of the virus and the associated interruption of activity to a combination, developing safe and effective ways to support the essential nature of our business and in some segments its starting to look toward psychological recovery where customers begin regaining competence in the future, and resume of full buying participation. The quarters results back that all up, demonstrating significant elements of advancements, sales and profitability improved sequentially across our operations despite the virus, the Snap-on team continued to make progress by increasing our ability to accommodate to the threat and pursue our essential commercial opportunity safely, moving along upward trajectories consistent with our general perspective on how the days of the virus are unfolding. Geographically, the impacts of the COVID continues to be varied across our operating landscapes. Asia Pacific remains virus challenged. Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And at the same time, Europe showed some signs of recovery. For business segments, certain areas education, oil and gas, aviation experienced greater and more prolonged difficulties, you might expect that. In fact, the speed at which our customers are accommodating to the environment does vary by segment, but leading the way upward, our vehicle repair technicians, supporting the essential mobility of our society and our direct selling vans, our franchisees providing extraordinary face to face value, both are taking full advantage of the opportunities and the numbers show it. And as we go forward, we see considerable additional opportunities as society pivots towards suburban locations into more individual transportation. I'll tell you it's music to the ears of the vehicle repair operation. We believe we do have abundant opportunities on the road ahead. And because of that, we're keeping our focus on Snap-On value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and Rapid Continuous Improvement or RCI. And in this area, that emphasis -- is this era, that emphasis is particularly important in customer connection innovation. We're following that focus to create a continuing stream of great new products, positioning our operation to -- operations, to monetize the accommodation and the psychological recovery that outlines the path to the future. And then the third quarter Snap-On value creation, customer connection innovations, role growth in the face of the uncertainty and lead to significant additions to our long line of product and innovation awards.  Snap-On was prominently represented with three motor magazine top tool awards. And we were further honored with five professional tool and equipment news or peak 10 innovation awards, but most significant of all, we are also recognized with 18 P10 people's choice awards, where the technicians, the actual users make the selections, 18 is a big number. It ties our record. That was set just a few years ago. You see an essential driver, our growth with, or without the pandemic is innovative product that makes work easier. It's always been our strength and the awards hard won our testimony that exceptional Snap-On products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the tasks and maintaining our forward progress, even in turbulence. That's the overview. Now for the results. Third quarter as reported sales of 941.6 million, we're up 39.8 million or 4.4% from 2019, including a 34.6 million or a 3.8% organic increase 4.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation and 1 million of acquisition related sales. From an earnings perspective, OpCo OI for the quarter of 185.7 million, including 1.5 million in direct costs associated with the virus and a $4.5 million hit from unfavorable currency compared to 167.7 million last year. The OpCo operating margin was 19.7%, up 110 basis points. For financial services operating income of 65.6 million increase from 2019, 61 million all while the 60 day delinquencies improve year over year, over year and that results combined with OpCo for a consolidated operating margin of 24.5%, 130 basis point improvement. Overall EPS was $3.28 and that compared to $2.96 last year, an increase a 10.8% in a somewhat challenged environment. Those are the overall numbers. Now the groups, in CNI volume in the third quarter of 308.4 million, including 2.2 million of favorable foreign currency was down 8% as reported 8.6% organically. Reflecting the decreases in we're talking, decrease in sales to our customers, a critical industries. I named a few and in Asia Pacific. Now our European based hand tool business was essentially plaque to last year. A positive result, given the twin headwinds of COVID-19 and the economic turbulence that now inhabits that region. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $43.1 million decrease $5.2 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and eight-tenths of COVID related expenses. Now C&I sales were down 8.6%. OI was down, 10.8%, a reasonable ratio, highlighting that RCI and cost containment went a long way in offsetting the impact of lower volume at C&I. In addition, the group did show significant sequential progress. The decline in sales and OI both narrowed considerably compared to the second quarter, reaffirming the positive upward trend that started after April. Regarding critical industries, military and international aviation, again, continue to register growth, while activity in education, oil and gas and U.S. aviation were particularly impacted. You might expect that, given the state of those particular industries. But we do remain confident in and committed to extending in the critical industries. And we see growing opportunities moving forward. And the principal path to that possibility is customer connection and innovation, combining to create powerful new products. Our European hand tools business showed resilience in the quarter, yes. And it was aided by a good dose of innovation, products like our all-new line of Bahco ERGO and insulated cutting and holding pliers. We redefined the steel mill and refined our heat treat process, developing a new metallurgy that strikes the perfect balance between strength and reliability. With those special material advantages, the edges were redesigned and improved, progressive blades that cut both soft cables at the tip and hardwires close to the joint, tremendous versability -- versatility. The new players have longer jaws and are aligned with more precision, better access and more accurate work. The insulation meets the IEC 60900 international standard for working with live systems up to 1,500 volts DC, substantial protection, safety in the -- in vehicle repair or in industrial environment. Strength, reliability, flexibility, accessibility and safety, the ERGO plier is a powerful addition to the Bahco lineup of insulated tools, now numbering 250 strong, all focused on electrical work. The new pliers were launched just this quarter, and I'll tell you, the recession was quite enthusiastic. We also continue to introduce attractive new entries in our lineup of 14.4 volt, the compact cordless power tools. This quarter, two strong additions, effective in the repair shop around the production line. The new CGRS861 or the CGRR861 incline and right angle grinder, high torque, longer run time, extended motor life, all in a compact, lightweight and easy to maneuver body. The new units both feature a dual -- they both feature a dual collet system, accommodating both eighth-inch and quarter-inch bits, allowing for a wide range of accessories and a feature that when combined with our built in spindle lock, makes for very quick changeover. That's a popular time saver. The new tools also include variable speed control, a key to handling a wide variety of servicing jobs. We launched in August. The technicians clearly have noticed and the grinders are already two of our million-dollar hit products. C&I demonstrating encouraging sequential progress, serving the essential. Each of the business is generating ongoing improvement and exiting the quarter stronger than when they entered and product investment authored a big piece of that progress. Now on to the Tools Group. As reported, sales up 16.8% to $449.8 million, including $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency and at $62.8 million or a 16% -- 16.2% organic increase, same-store sales, with the U.S. and international businesses all growing at double digits. The operating earnings, $87.1 million, including $400,000 of virus related cost and $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency that compared to $53 million last year. The Tools Group operating success was a clear confirmation on our view of the COVID-19 trajectory on the resilience of the vehicle repair business and on the strength of our direct face-to-face band model. As we entered the quarter, we saw our franchisees seeking increasingly effective ways to accommodate pandemic. For doing this, pursuing the support of the essential and we've helped in that effort with time saving aids, including further automation in the customer collection process, remote diagnostic software renewals and multi-franchisee data bundling. New technology aids aimed at making it easier to operate in the virus environment and saving scarce franchisee time under any conditions. Also, as I'm sure many of you are aware, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-On Franchisee Conference, the SFC. No surprise. This year was different than any held before. The in-person gathering was canceled, and our 100th anniversary celebration plan for that meeting was postponed to 2021. Instead of the usual event, we came together over the weekend ordinarily reserved for the SFC yet a virtual conference, live from the Forge. More than 3,800 van drivers participated at a distance, representing nearly 98% of the North American network, flowing what was I think a rousing Friday night kickoff. We have presentations on significant offerings training on unique product advantages and seminars on effective selling techniques, after that Friday show, 180 individual videos featuring products and programs and training were posted on demand. And through the course of the weekend, franchisees wrapped up over 43,000 views of the content. The live from the Forge action was concluded on Sunday afternoon, and I'll tell you, it was a clear success. Continuing the SFC tradition, highlighting new product, strengthening our franchise capabilities with great training and reinforcing our brand with a positive message and a lot of fun. It was abundantly evident at live from the Forge that new product is a big driver for franchisee excitement. We do have considerable confidence in the power of our product line, and there are real reasons for that belief. You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that, as our franchisees saw, there's a continuing stream of other great new offerings, candidates for next year's recognition, attention getters that make repair work easier and really help the technicians meet the challenges of increasing vehicle complexity at the model years roll by. Just one example. Unveiled at the conference was our New Steel Titan Roll Cab with a new color combination, eye catching, dark titanium paint brushed in blue trim, special details in bright blue, the Snap-On nameplate, the S-ranch logo located on the cap face, and a special S-ranch imprint on each interior liner. The Titan is visually striking, I can tell you, but it's also work enabling, three extra wide drawers for easy access to most commonly used tools, the speed door, improved organization for a variety of small items like drill bit and a power drawer for power tool charging using an exclusive power Snap-On, exclusive power strip design with five offset AC outlets and 2 USB ports. Vehicle repair is moving towards psychological recovery, gaining confidence, starting to invest in longer payback items, and a steel tighten is just the ticket. It's a product excitement even in the pandemic, and it was since then, the customers love it. Also introduced in this quarter was the new 8 piece, power steering and alternator polymaster set a handle, helping technicians to more easily remove and install presson pullies and most GM, Ford and Chrysler engines. The unique reversible dual design that this handle has includes multiple adapters, allowing for quick model changeovers and increased productivity, pretty important in the garage. The master set is a necessity for smooth installation and removal of power steering pump, alternator and vacuum pump pullies in a large range of vehicles. It's manufacturing in our Elkmont, Alabama plant, right here in the U.S.A. I was just there last week, and I could tell you, it's a great team. It's no wonder the initial response that master set was very positive. It made our list of hit million dollar products in just the first month. Well, that's the Tools Group, accommodating the pandemic, taking advantage of the psychological recovery, furthering innovation and strengthening for the future. Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I group also posted significant sequential improvement from the second quarter, narrowing the shortfall to 1.6%. You may recall that in the second quarter, the sales were down 29.8%. That's a big move. Volume in this period was \u2013 volume in this period and in the third quarter was 317.5 million, including 800,000 of favorable foreign currency and $1 million from recent acquisitions. The slightly lower activity reflected continued growth in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shops and flat capital spending on undercar equipment, all balanced by improved but still decreased activity in vehicle OEM projects. RS&I operating earnings of $80.1 million, decreased $3.2 million, reflecting the lower volume. OI margin was 25.2%, down 60 basis points, including a 10-point hit from currency. So while the overall group was somewhat impacted, diagnostics and information-based operations continue to grow. And once again, new products led the way. Among the new offerings launched in the quarter was our latest intelligence diagnostic unit, the Apollo D9, ergonomically designed, the new handheld -- it's a new handheld and it features ultrafast, 2-second start-up time, a larger 9-inch touch screen and a number of preloaded training videos installed directly on the tool for instant use. The platform is powered by our intelligent diagnostics software, over 1 billion repair records and over 100 billion unique diagnostic events, all organized to help technicians fix cars much faster. Now we've been talking about shortening the selling cycle for our complex diagnostics and increasing the sales capacity of our franchisees. Well, live from the Forge features a detailed seminar on operating and selling the new Apollo and to make that distance trading extra powerful. Each franchisee was provided with a new demo unit to follow right along light, hand on with the program. And in addition to the special training, unit could also be used immediately the next week to demonstrate the new Apollo's compelling advantages right in the field seems to be working. Although it was introduced at the end of the quarter, our on the street feedback says our new handheld will go a long way to advance our strategic trust into intelligent diagnostics. We're confident in the strength of RS&I. And we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. Well, that our third quarter, absorbing a shock following the accommodation, moving on to psychological recovery, keeping our people safe while we serve the essential, continuing to improve sequentially on a positive trend, a successful SFC at a distance, confirming the power of our direct selling van model, results above last year. Sales up 4.4%, OI margin, 19.7%, 110 basis points higher. Financial services navigating the virus era with strike and an EPS of $3.28. All achieved while maintaining and investing in our strengths of products, brands and people. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $941.6 million in the quarter compared to $901.8 million last year, reflecting a 3.8% organic sales gain, $4.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $1 million of acquisition related sales. The organic increase reflected sequential improvements in year-over-year performance in all three operating segments, led by the Tools Group segment with a double-digit sales gain in the third quarter as compared to last year. While sales in the Commercial & Industrial and Repair Systems & Information segments were lower than the third quarter of 2019, they did increase significantly from 2020 second quarter levels. During the quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic remained the headwind in certain geographies and within certain industries. But overall, the momentum experienced in the month of June continued into the full third quarter for all of our businesses. Similar to last year, we identified last quarter, we identified $1.5 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19. These costs include direct labor, under absorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantine associates and event cancellation fees as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. Consolidated gross margin of 49.9% compared to 49.7% last year. The 20 basis point improvement primarily reflects the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 30.2%, improved 90 basis points from 31.1% last year, largely reflecting the impact of higher sales and savings from cost containment actions and accommodating the impact that COVID-19 has had on the overall business environment. Operating earnings report financial services of $185.7 million, including $1.5 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and $4.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $167.7 million in 2019, reflecting a 10.7% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.7%, including 20 basis points of direct costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, improved 110 basis points from 18.6% last year. Financial Services revenue of $85.8 million in the third quarter of 2020 compared to $84.1 million last year. While operating earnings of $65.6 million compared to $61 million in 2019, principally reflecting growth in the Financial Services portfolio as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $251.3 million, including $1.5 million of direct COVID-related costs and $4.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $228.7 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.5% compared to 23.2% in 2019. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 23.4% compared to 23.5% last year. Finally, net earnings of $179.7 million or $3.28 per diluted share, increased $15.1 million or $0.32 per share from 2019 levels, representing a 10.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $308.4 million compared to $335.3 million last year, reflecting an 8.6% organic sales decline and $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease primarily reflects a low-teen decline in both sales to customers in critical industries and in our Asia Pacific operations. While sales of the segment's European-based hand tools business were essentially flat. Across the critical industries, gains in international aviation and sales to the U.S. military were more than offset by declines in natural resources, including oil and gas, as well as continued lower technical education sales. Within Asia, sales to customers in India and Southeast Asia continue to lag behind some recovery experienced in other areas of the region. Gross margin of 37.3%, declined 60 basis points year-over-year, mostly due to the impact of lower volume and 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These decreases were partially offset by material cost savings and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives. The operating expense margin of 23.3% improved 20 basis points as compared to last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $23.1 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $48.3 million last year. The operating margin of 14% compared to 14.4% a year-ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $449.8 million compared to $385.2 million in 2019, reflecting a 16.2% organic sales gain, and a $1.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-teen gain in our U.S. franchise operations and approximately a 20% increase in the segment's international operations. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter improved 210 basis points, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. The operating expense margin of 26.1% improved from 29.6% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions, including lower travel and meeting related expenses. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $87.1 million, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $53 million last year. The operating margin of 19.4%, compared to 13.8% a year ago. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $317.5 million compared to $322.7 million a year ago, reflecting a 2.2% organic sales decline, as well as $800,000 of favorable foreign currency translation and $1 million of acquisition related sales. The organic decrease includes a high single-digit decline in sales to OEM dealerships, partially offset by a low single digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and mangers. Gross margin of 47.3%, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, declined 40 basis points from last year. The operating expense margin of 22.1% increased 20 basis points from 21.9% last year. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $80.1 million compared to $83.3 million last year, the operating margin of 25.2%, compared to 25.8% a year ago, including the effects of 20 basis points of unfavorable currency and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19. Now, turning to slide 10. Revenue from Financial Services of $85.8 million compared to $84.1 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $65.6 million compared to $61 million in 2019. Financial Services expenses of $20.2 million decreased $2.9 million from last year's levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, reflecting a year-over-year decline in net charge offs. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Service expenses were nine-tenths of 1% and 1.1% in the third quarter of 2020 and 2019 respectively. In the third quarter, the average yield and finance receivables of 17.8% in 2020, compared to 17.7% in 2019. Respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.4% and 9.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operation support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the third quarter, approximately $16 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $252.8 million in the third quarter of 2020, compared to $253.5 million last year. Originations of both finance receivables and contract receivables were essentially flat the last year's levels. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $25 million in the third quarter. Collections of finance receivables in the quarter of $185.2 million, compared to collections of $181.6 million during the third quarter of 2019. As we mentioned last quarter, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we did provide short term payment relief or forbearance, to some of our franchisees qualifying customers. As at the end of September, those accounts having forbearance terms, we're back to more typical levels and were below 1% of the finance receivable portfolio, as compared to about 2.5% as of the end of the second quarter. Trailing 12-month net losses on extending credit or finance receivables of $46.7 million represented 2.7% of outstandings at quarter end, down 23 basis points sequentially. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for U.S. extended credit, compared to 1.7% last year. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 50 basis points, mostly reflecting the typical seasonal increase of 20 to 30 basis points we experienced between the second and third quarters, as well as the 20 or 30 basis point benefits to this rate reflected in the second quarter of 2020 that was associated with the deferred payment programs that were offered through June. Now, turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $224 million in the quarter increased $92.9 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $57 million decrease in working capital, largely driven by lower year-over-year changes in inventories. Net cash used by investing activities of $18.8 million included net additions to finance receivables of $11.7 million and capital expenditures of $10.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $105.1 million included cash dividends of $58.8 million and the repurchase of 300,000 shares of common stock for $45.1 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of the end of September, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $294.5 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivables decreased $75.7 million from 2019 year end; days sales outstanding of 64 days compared to 67 days of 2019 year end; inventories increased $4 million in 2019 year end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4, although slightly improved as compared to 2.3 times at the end of the second quarter compared to 2.6 at year end 2019. Our quarter end cash position of $787.5 million compared to $184.5 million at year end 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 15.5% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks Aldo. We are encouraged by the quarter. Our operations, all the groups, C&I, RS&I, and Tools improving sequentially, shocked to accommodations of psychological recovery, tracing a clear and continuing upward trend. A significant rise in the Tools Group up 16.2% organically same-store sales, confirming the opportunities in vehicle repair and showing the power of our manned network. Financial service is performing well in the turbulence, demonstrating clearly the robust nature of its processes and its portfolio, and the positive overall results. Sales up 4.4%, 3.8% organically, OI margin 19.7% strong, representing a rise of 110 basis points. EPS $3.28, up 10.8% from last year, significant gains against the turbulence. All achieved, while consciously continuing to fortify our strength and advantage in product, a range of new offerings, in brand, a successful SSC despite the distance, and in people. We're keeping our team intact. You see, we are confident in our belief that we have ongoing upward momentum in the near-term, and we recognize that we've expanded opportunity in changing technologies and with the greater use of personal vehicles in the long-term. And we're maintaining our advantages through the virus, so that Snap-On will be at full strength, taking advantage of these abundant opportunities, driving continuous progress through this period of challenge, and well beyond. Now, I\u2019ll speak directly to our franchisees and associates, I know many of you are listening, this was an encouraging quarter. And we do have a bright future. And I know none of it would be possible without your energy, your capability and your dedication. For your essential efforts in supporting our society, you have my admiration. For your extraordinary achievement and driving us forward, you have my congratulations. And for your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Good morning. Congratulations on a strong quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Chris. Christopher Glynn : Just curious at Tools Group, how to contextualize the growth, which really had no foreshadow or precedent the last few years, other than maybe why is there to look at 2Q to 3Q combined year-over-year growth, or in terms of\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Look, I think the thing is I think we said when we went into the first quarter. In the first quarter, we said we got hammered in March, but things were looking pretty good before that. so I think we had made investments in products and processes that were helping us mind the franchisees capability more effectively, and we started to see that toward the end of the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter. And then, KT Bar [ph], the doer on the virus and so things go down. But we started to see people recover, that's why we say shock accommodation. They started to accommodate, and we said, June was coming back tracing an upward trend. So when you look at the third quarter, I think you think of it in, okay, there is some makeup I assume when things are going down so badly, particularly in April. There's some catch up there, but here's the thing that makes sense to us when you look at the sales off the van, the sales off the van have been strong for a long time. They were better in the second quarter than our sales. And in the third quarter, they were every bit as strong deep into -- clear weak, well into double digits every month. And then when you look back at it after the third quarter. The sales off the van are up year-over-year by a clear amount. And so they're play it by clear amount, so I think that's the data point. It seems to me we're going back to like that upward trend now what happens going forward, hard to say. I guess that's the $64,000 question. What I like what I see on this kind of situation, Tool Group seems to be hitting on all cylinders, wildcard could be Europe, and in the quarter one of the cool things about the quarter was the UK, it turned around quite well. I don't know if you caught the international operations up double digits, and that hadn't been a situation. And so there's a lot of ups and downs there and that could be an uncertainty going forward over those geographies and so on, but I'll tell you what, there's a lot of momentum and a lot of good reason \u2013 we see a lot of good reasons for this and the franchisees becoming more effective in the way we knew how to get over this because of the, you know, this wasn't our first rodeo associated with the downward trend. And we knew how to get our franchisees through it, and we got them through it and it paid off. So I think, I think you kind of look at it, okay, you know, 16.2% organically, it's a big number, but we really mined the profits. And -- and I think if you think about off the van, it shows that there's an appetite out there and vehicle repair is back. It's approaching, it's approaching psychologic, what we call in our context and our construct, psychological recovery and the vans are taking advantage of it.  What we like about this is, we've gone to something arithmetic. It shows the resiliency of vehicle repair in turbulence and the positivity and the strength of the face to face bad model. When we enable it with these technologies, we've been helping them. Q \u2013 Christopher Glynn : Thanks. And just to follow up, I was curious what degree you guys contemplate a Upshift in the payout ratio, given that organic reinvestment and bolt-ons and share purchaser, you know, very much covered in your kind of pay as you go rates there. I think, you know, some field is a strong case for 50% to 60% payout ratio, curious your thoughts around that? A \u2013 Nick Pinchuk : Well, Chris, you probably know that we have in recent history, usually revisit the dividend rate in the fourth quarter, that's coming up upon us. And like every meeting we have with the Board of Directors we'll have that discussion and we'll try to take a step forward in what we think is affordable. Realizing that Snap-On approaches that treat the dividend increase, kind of like a perpetuity. Again, that's been our historic pattern and I'll kind of leave it at that. Aldo Pagliari : Yeah. I mean, our governing policy and dividends is perpetuity. We think it's a cornerstone and in a hallmark of the resilience and power of our model. So we believe in that strongly. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Luke Junk with Baird. Q \u2013 Luke Junk : Everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So two questions on the ToolsGroup first wondering if you could comment on growth rates from a product line standpoint, it seems like diagnostic sales are likely up moderately based on your RS&I commentary and two storage, I guess if we just look at originations feels really stable, should be read that handle sales were the big driver of the strength, or is there something else that should be taking into account? A \u2013 Nick Pinchuk : Sort of yes with qualifications to those questions, I guess, I don't know. Look here, first of all, looking at it. Look, I just say this as a disclaimer upfront. Looking at the, the quarterly byproduct numbers, doesn't really tell you that much because it's heavily dependent on what introduced, what are the products and programs that break on the mind on the -- on with the franchisees and then onto the technicians in the quarter that really heavily influences it. So one quarter, can't give you any real information on this, but it can, it's better than a pop an eye start sharp stick when you look at these things sometimes. So look, here's the thing, big ticket items. We're up in the quarter. Our sales for the franchisees were up in the quarter they were up, okay you know, a tool storage had a nice quarter actually. And I bought the, there is a timing difference between originations and sales, our sales to the vans. Remember what you're seeing from us is we sell to the vans and then they got probably first of all, okay, they got to probably first of all, okay, they got to get there, you know they get there and then the guys get them up and they find a buyer and then they get credit so on. So there can be \u2013 there can be some sort of disconnection between the timing. But generally, I'd say, that's right. If they were up in the hand tools we're very strong in the quarter, very strong. And they lead the way, but power tools were nicely up too. So I mean, there are a number of different products that were up. The hand tools of course, and a lot depends on what you feature and what the new products are, which is why I talked about the master set, because hand tools was a star in the quarter, but it wasn't to the exclusion say, like total storage and the others. Luke Junk : Okay. That\u2019s\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : The other think I think you would \u2013 one other things I think you would conclude out of this, I think is that when you see originations in effect, what do they got 0.3% or something like that, or you know, something maybe a little bit bigger in the U.S., and you see me say that tool storage is up to the franchisees and the big ticket is up for franchisees, you would say that, it's not the model of the product, it\u2019s that the fact that being flat, even flat we're up a little bit year-over-year means that they're going to psychological recovery. In other words, the garages and the franchise, then the technicians and the franchisees themselves are starting to believe in the future and have confidence to invest in longer payback items. This is kind of a watershed of van's in terms of the state of mind throughout the industry. One of the one of the setbacks and if you think about it, boy, you just step back and you look at the news about the auto industry in general, but also you kind of look around, you know, vehicle repair is pretty robust, actually in wages were up for technicians in August, according to \u2013 the rollings roll up and so I think that's a positive. And when I go out, when I went to the factory in Alabama, you know, in Elkmont, Alabama, I also went to franchisees, I just talked to several franchises across the country and they're all talking about robust garages. When I went to a garage recently out around here, you couldn't get in the parking lot, there were too many cars. So I think this is going pretty well. Luke Junk : Okay. And then second questions is just the clarification. Wondering what the statuses of the deferred payment sales plan programs that you told us about back in April? Was there any impact from those plans in the quarter from a sales standpoint in the Tools Group. And then from a credit standpoint, although you'd mentioned the sort of 20 to 30 basis point influence sequentially in the U.S. extending credit delinquency rates. Should we assume that that fully washes out in the third quarter effectively versus the noise if you want to call it in 2Q? Nick Pinchuk : In Q3, there was no sales part of its derived from the deferred programs because there were no deferred programs. No, I say that our Elite franchisees, people that we strike in the Platinum program called Elite, always have the privilege of being able to offer a 60 day deferred programs as a normal course of business. So I won\u2019t call that just normal activity. So there is nothing unique in Q2, in Q3 that benefited the sales line. When it comes to impact on delinquency rates and collections and charge-offs, we factor all of that in based on our history which is considerable, because again, while we don't have in depth COVID-19 experience as is our first experience at that, we do have a lot of experience with catastrophic events which are usually more local. And we do provide in our provisioning for what would be the anticipated losses when you have people that take advantage of deferred programs versus non-deferred programs. So having said all that, I guess, I don't want to use the word \u2018it washes out\u2019 but it's already kind of reflected in our results. And going forward, whether we offer more differed programs will remains to be seen. We look at the opportunities and if they're created. We'll think about it, see if it creates a reason to buy now. Nick Pinchuk : What's interesting from our perspective is, if it weren\u2019t for the COVID, everybody wouldn't be on the edge of their seat with this. I recognize that everybody wants to see if there's going to be problems with the credit company and collections and delinquencies and so on, because of the COVID. But in reality, the deferral is just an everyday thing for us. We do it from time to time. It happens on a regular -- not regular, not periodic basis, but it happens quite often. We just mix it up so we give, say, our customers a reason to buy now, and a franchisee a reason to change up a sales pitch to have something to talk about to these customers. Luke Junk : Good. Appreciate the color on both those questions and I'll leave it there. Thanks guys. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. How are you doing? Bret Jordan : Good. Hey, when you think about the impact of, I guess -- the mix, it sounded like the hand tools were very strong. Do you think stimulus played a role? I mean, obviously, the garages are seeing business as people are putting their personal cars back on the road, have you used... Nick Pinchuk : I think, I don't know. Look, I think, my gift is, first of all, our guys are employed mostly. You can look at the thing, things dipped. I think the number of hours went down 5% or something like that in April. And then it's snapped right back and generally what we see, what I'm hearing from my franchisees and I've talked to a lot of them, the garages are pretty much employed. So I don't think unemployment is a big deal. I mean, the unemployment deal or the PPI. You could have argued that that whatever people got in the beginning like $1,200 or something, that might have helped. I'm reading that people put that in a bank, I don't know. But I think it would have been over in the second quarter. We kind of thought that might have helped us in the second quarter. That was one of the questions for us, when we saw the tools group go up and hit the 3%, or I guess it was 2.4% in United States and that kind of thing. We thought maybe that might have been helping us. But I -- my sense of it is, it was probably either banked or spent before it. I don't think it was driving the third quarter. I don't think. And I don't think those \u2013 I don\u2019t think our guys are sitting on the edge of the seat, waiting for Congress to approve another one. Now if they do\u2026 Bret Jordan : So the mix of cash versus credit buyer, I mean, it sort of seems like you had a very strong tools number but not as much growth on the credit books. So was there a real shift here to cash purchase in the third quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Well, there was a shift towards -- there was a shift toward the smaller -- not shift, but in the quarter we had nice hand tools and they tend to be RA, not long term credit. Remember, when you say credit, when you're talking about credit, everything sold off to buyers on credit. Bret Jordan : Right. Nick Pinchuk : Everything. Right? And so, okay, you're only talking about whether it's 12 to 15 week credit or -- three year or four year credit, really, so everything\u2019s sold on credit. So I don't think, if you say -- if you put that in a pot and say everything was sold, so I don't see people paying cash so much. I haven't heard people pay in cash. And our RA book is up some, because hand tools were strong. Anytime hand tools are strong, you see that happen, and the longer term credit tends to be a little bit less. But actually we thought longer term credit, given the environment was pretty robust in the quarter. Now, as I said, I think it's a sign of things getting better in the in the general view of the repair shop. Now, if somehow a miracle happens and the people in Washington get together and they decide to send everybody $1,200, I think that would be might be cherry on the top, I don't know. I don't think we got much in the third quarter though. I really don't. Bret Jordan : Did you talk about the cadence of the third quarter? I mean, obviously the timing, you didn't have the franchise event, so maybe people were spending more money early or-- Nick Pinchuk : Yes, all right. I mean the cadence in the -- Bret, the cadence in the third quarter isn't as clear as the second quarter because we're coming off some -- April is god awful. So, I mean the thing is you're coming off of that and you kind of roll up but generally, if you look at -- I mean if you want to talk to Tools Group, if you look at the sales off the van which is not really subject to much SFC impact. It was -- each month was into the double-digit range clearly. So, I think the cadence was pretty solid off the van. You get up and down depending on where the SFC is, I think here. Sometimes like for example, when you have a live SFC, people tend to keep their powder dry because they want to get there and spend they it's almost like a Disney World. We were -- it's almost like a fun experience when they get there, and they run around and they buy all this stuff. And so this was a little more measured because it was added this and so not quite as exciting and so they spent a little earlier than they would have and I think up. So, that's a fair view. But if you look at the stuff off the van, it seems to be solid. Bret Jordan : Thank you. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle : Good morning. Thanks very much. Nick Pinchuk : Curt, how are you doing? Curtis Nagle : Great. Nick, Aldo, how are you guys doing? Nick Pinchuk : We're doing okay. Curtis Nagle : Terrific, terrific. Glad to hear. So, maybe just first one on inventory. I think -- looks like there was a nice work down. Could you talk to you a little bit about which segments you saw I guess the largest declines or I guess the biggest movement year-over-year--? Nick Pinchuk : I think we didn't see much of a downtick in the Tools Group inventory, but that you have to look at it through the lens of seasonality. Tools Group inventory always rises in the third quarter in anticipation of the sales and in anticipation of having to make good the order burst that comes out of an SFC. So, fundamentally inventory flat in the quarter meant that the Tools Groups seasonally look pretty good really compared to what we -- what you might expect if that had been a normal year. The other groups I think came down. I think our overall inventory was down a reasonable amount, so that's -- I think it was -- as you might expect in this kind of era. Aldo Pagliari : Yeah. The inventory in constant dollars, Curt, was down about $28 million, $29 million. As Nick mentioned, Tools Group relatively flat in terms of their inventory move and the other -- were shared kind of equally between the commercial and industry groups and I both had contributions to lower inventory which is expected because their sales were not as robust as last year. Nick Pinchuk : But I wanted -- what I wanted to emphasize in a call though. Hey, one of the things that -- I tell you what both were sequentially improved. I mean C&I was down what 25%, 19.7% I think. It's about 20% in the quarter -- second quarter is 8.6%. That's a nice improvement and then the one that really came from behind was RS&I, we thought, I think -- I'll share with you, we thought RS&I, the garages themselves based on the atmosphere in the OEM would have been harder to come back, would take a longer to come back. But they moved from -- they were down like, I said in my script, 29.8% last quarter and they knock I think 2.2% organically and one down, 1.6% as reported, so pretty big move. So I think what you're seeing in those businesses, even though they aren't -- they don't have the starry numbers as the Tools Group has, because their industries are still going through accommodation and aren't even approaching psychological recovery, they\u2019re showing some pretty good movement. Curtis Nagle : Understood, great. And then maybe just a quick clarification in terms of, I guess a sequential trend in sale out on the vans, the Tools Group in 2Q to 3Q, did it improve or how did that trend I just didn't quite\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, it improved. Sure it improved, it improved. But it was -- I would say this, it was -- in Q2, it was running ahead on the sales to demand I think. Sales that was kind of -- if you want to think of it this way Curtis, you can think of it this way and I would think that Q2 inventory was being pushed out a little bit. The inventories were going down because the sales off the van were a little bit more robust, not great. But they were more robust than -- and they started to spike up in June, which is why we started to talk about the Tools Group in June, we could see that, in fact, we said that on a call I think. And then in the third quarter, more or less equal, the van, the sales off van were about equal to the, you know, for government work were about equal to the sales off the van. That's how it happens. So I think just the sales to the van kind of caught up. Doesn't look like they're building inventory though in the third quarter, it just looks like they kind of stay stable. Curtis Nagle : Okay, very good. Thanks very much and good luck with the rest of the quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Next. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning Gary. Most of my questions have been answered but just one in terms of -- you had a little bit of a tailwind from FX on the sales side, what kind of impact did that have on the adjusted EPS for the quarter, Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : We actually had negative $0.06 of EPS driven by currency because while the sales line benefited, there was currency transaction losses, principally driven by sales of U.S. manufactured product in Canada and the United Kingdom, but also the commercial industrial group. It has to do with flows between euro based customers versus Swedish based sources of supply. That's what drove the transaction. Nick Pinchuk : What happens Gary is that the transaction where it's translations tend to be current, transactions tends to look back because you set the cost of product when it gets shipped and it doesn't get sold sometimes later, and that's what drives that difference, so in effect transaction kind of trails to situation. Gary Prestopino : Okay. So you\u2019d expect less negative impact certainly in work? Nick Pinchuk : Right. You get bigger sales, good news and lower profit, bad news. Gary Prestopino : Okay, great. And then just early on in the quarter here, particularly we're hearing a resurgence of this COVID and I think the UK has put in some more stringent lockdowns. Can you maybe talk about, what you're seeing early stage in Q4 with various regions of the world. Nick Pinchuk : We don't really give guidance. But look, I can tell you my broad view is that boy, you know, if you look at the United States, I don't know. I think vehicle repair particularly won't get shocked again. You know, they're not -- in fact everywhere won't get shocked again. Whatever happens, I think our people will accommodate better than they did in the April and March area. So I think that's kind of a broader view. I think, look, I think the United States kind of continues to March, you know, nobody knows what's going to happen exactly. But I think our -- the accommodation continues in the United States in all our areas. Europe's got twin problems with economics and so on. So it's hard to see across all those geographies, what's going to happen there. Again though, I don't think they get shocked again.  So I think, you know, they manage it, but it could be slowed down or it could be accelerated. Asia Pacific, I think China of course is okay. Japan should be okay. I think, I don't know what the heck's happening in India and Southeast Asia, but they seem to be completely flat on their back in terms of their ability to deal with this situation. So, so we'll see how those -- that's how I see it playing out. And I think, you know, we see upward trend, like we said, last time. I think, I believe in the shock accommodation, psychological model, but the value of that slope upward will change depending on how conditions occur. I do think they'll report a fight against the really bad news and that's really, I'm not telling you anything we could have just as good a quarter or a better quarter next time. Q \u2013 Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Stember with C.L. King. Q \u2013 Scott Stember : Good morning guys. Nick Pinchuk : Scott, how you doing? Q \u2013 Scott Stember : Good. Most of my questions have been answered also, but just going back to the U.K. in the tools group, I know that obviously things have been tough there for the past year, year and a half and got worse in the second quarter, but that was a pretty eye-popping improvement that we saw in tools in the U.K.. Could you just talk, is it -- was there anything else going on there? Was there new products introduced, and just trying to get a sense of the sustainability of the recovery? Nick Pinchuk : There's a couple of things. I look, I think we believe U.K. came a long way and in fact their acceleration upward had already begun in June. It just, it just wasn't the level of us, but you could, if you go back, they were deeper in April and if you looked at the slope of the curve upwards in June, you said wait, something's going on there. And I think part of it was, is that okay, you have people suffering through the shock and they were really shocked. And you had the economics on top of it. In my own personal opinion were three things. One is they started to accommodate. Two; the virus kind of got people's minds off of Brexit, they didn't pay attention, you know, so much. So it wasn't weighing on people in terms of economics or coming out of the -- at least getting a little better than the virus they started to figure out. And three, we made changes to our network to try to make it, try to get training the new product there is every bit as robust as here. It just follows a little bit later. So we're introducing some of the diagnostics that had already been introduced here and wasn't there and other new products. So there is consistency in the new product. It wasn't different than the U.S. but I mean, we kept pounding the new product in there. I think, I think those are the three factors. Now it was up, as you say was up quite nicely. We'll see how it plays out. I don't think it will get shocked again though. Q \u2013 Scott Stember : Got it. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We\u2019ll take our last question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yeah, good morning, everyone. Nick, congratulation \u2013 yeah, congratulations on a good quarter. I guess the question is been asked earlier about some of the spending patterns and technicians that came off that 90 day deferrals, I just wonder if we could go back to that start off with here and just the guys that qualified for that program and benefited from that program as they came off that program what kind of spending patterns did you see from them or were they pretty much removed from the market and the strength that you've achieved this quarter is off the balance of the \u2013 of the base? Aldo Pagliari : David I think people keep spending. We don't isolate on whether you have just an easy loan. Remember they have two-thirds of business activity are with the franchisee on a revolving account type basis. And they remain generally active. I'm sure you get all kinds of examples. Some people might not buy for a while, although people keep buying each and every week. You get all kinds of patterns, but the fact is there was a deferred program and I'll take really radically changes the flow of activity, because again, we've had programs like this more regarding Q2, certainly given the unusual nature of it, but a pretty consistent. The thing you have to always remember, people ask Nick earlier on the call about stimulus. Remember everybody who has a job and I think we said, most of our customer base still hasn\u2019t come has more discretionary money in their pocket simply because a lot of other venues to spend your money are not available whether it would be going to dinner, the movies or a sports game, so that people have more money beyond just stimulus checks coming into mail and technicians like the right tools that he's been demonstrated over the tunnel of time. David MacGregor : One would think, though, that if somebody's coming off a 90 day furlough because they were strapped for credit that they might not be very aggressive buyers. Aldo Pagliari : Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. That's an assumption that's untrue. David MacGregor : Is it? Aldo Pagliari : They're not \u2013 they're not strapped for credit. Look here's the thing. We didn't \u2013 we didn't just give 90 day credit to the people who were strapped for credit. We offered 90 day credit as a reason to buy now. It's like a car loan. So the point is, I think the point is, is those people know who you are? You're going to buy a still tight, David? Okay, I can get a 90 day deferral or not? I might take it, right. You might take it. Its all the money that you have. You might take it. David MacGregor : All right. Thank you for that clarification. I appreciate that. I wanted to just explore as well the divergence between kind of the growth that you've achieved in C&I and RS&I versus what you're seeing in the Tools Group. And I appreciate directionally both C&I and RS&I are moving positively versus what you printed in the second quarter. But still high single-digit declines in C&I, high single-digit declines in OEM dealership business and RS&I. It seems a little in contrast to up mid-teens in the Tools Group. And so I guess, your thoughts on that divergence? And then secondly, do we see those other businesses catch up here in the fourth quarter? Should you have that much\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : I think this. I think we have the potential to catch up. I think \u2013 I'll tell you what, I think you can write this on a black letter law on your shorts about this. In general, in general what we see is when you have anything like this in terms of a macro, what we see is the smaller businesses, if they have \u2013 if they continue in the business, which vehicle repair has been continuing in the business, they don't think so \u2013 they're like making money, they're spending the kind of rolling. I do think the bigger the business, the more it tends to look at what's going to happen in the future? I'm not sure. They get a little bit more reticent there. They have a little bit more, I guess, forward outlook that troubles them in the day that weighs on their decision-making a day. I think this has happened through my entire time here, we've seen this as macroeconomic expectations go up and down. So, if you look at C&I, you see certain other segments particularly troubled, particularly troubled. Other segments like military and the international aviation up and you see a little bit of heavy truck a little bit better. And so you can see that. But eventually, we see them recovering. That's the difference. It's actually the industry, the environment and also the fact that the garages are smaller and therefore, closer to that cash action and the actual action, and therefore, more confident as they see it continuing. I think this is just psychological. And then if you go to RS&I, I think you're looking at a two-pronged effort. You have the independence, which tend to get a little better, but you also have the dealers who were pretty shook up at the beginning. They were rolling -- they were coming in to the virus as you probably know. With probably a negative view, hey, the SAAR is going to be down for next year, is it look good. Maybe we're going to -- so the thing is they sort of entered this with kind of a downward look, maybe even extra inventory. So, then they got through, then they start to come up. But I think those guys get a little bit more reticent and going forward in terms of investing. Remember, our C&I and RS&I tend to be more capital-based type actions, right? They're good business, but they're more capital, and you would see them being more, I guess, washes. I think they come out of it, though. I think we're loving the RS&I look this quarter, really. David MacGregor : So, let me just ask you as well because we're top of the hour here and we'd like to wrap this up, I'm sure. But it seems like software sales may have been a stronger contributor this quarter as well. You talked about the Apollo D9, but there were some other introductions as well. Nick Pinchuk : Yes. They were -- look, software is about a third of RS&I, the Mitchell 1 Software business, which is repair shop information and running the repair shops in both cars and trucks... David MacGregor : Within the Tools Group. Nick Pinchuk : You're talking about the Tools Group? David MacGregor : Yes. Nick Pinchuk : I'm talking about RS&I. I thought -- you talk about Tools Group. David MacGregor : I'm talking about the Tools Group here. Nick Pinchuk : Sorry, sorry. And the Tools Group, the software business was pretty good. But I wouldn't say I wouldn't it was an extraordinary contributor, an outsized contributor. It didn't stand out really in any way to us so much in this quarter. It was okay, but not -- you wouldn't have called it a variance driver. David MacGregor : Right. And then last question for me. If the franchisees are taking big ticket again, it sounds like your storage business good. It sounds like diagnostics was okay. We should see some pretty good originations numbers in the fourth quarter, shouldn't we? So what would be--? Nick Pinchuk : Well, okay. Assuming itself, right-- David MacGregor : Right. Nick Pinchuk : Right, right. David MacGregor : You\u2019re kind of enjoying this, I guess, is. If-- Nick Pinchuk : It seems okay. Yes, that's a reasonable assumption. David MacGregor : Right. So if we see -- Aldo Pagliari : Again David, they always have a choice to make it. If you remember that Snap-On does benefit by having what I would say is the industry's leading residual values. So, when they take trade-ins, particularly in diagnostics becomes a factor, that's where the penetration rate on diagnostics for one reason is lower. There's a good chance that the finance can be handled through the RA account. If you take in, as an example, of $2,000 trading unit on a $3,000 item, you don't have to necessarily finance those. So, that's why you get a little bit of a different blend. And I think in this low interest rate environment, some franchisees feel they have the wherewithal to stretch a bit or borrow locally if they don't borrow from Snap-On Credit. And I think they have some versatility given the low interest rate environment. So that's why you don't necessarily have the same predictability as to what falls on to the easy program. Again, remember, the franchisee decides that. Snap-On doesn't decide that. David MacGregor : No, no. But I would think at this point, franchisee would consider I got 100% risk on the RA versus 25% risk on EC and I probably better put Nick Pinchuk : That's not necessarily true. Aldo Pagliari : Yeah. But David, but take a step back, you can look over the long tunnel of time, our default rates and the franchisees see this. Remember, our franchisees are pretty long in there too. They have, on average, 14 years of experience. They see that the defaults while never guaranteed are pretty predictable to some extent, and through good and bad times kind of steady. So they don't rush to outboard at least, again, always on the fringes you get a little bit of everything. But they don't rush the panic and say, well, let's give us the Snap-On credit because they only have 25% exposure versus 100%. Of course, there's some that might consider that. But the great population does not. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. David, the franchisees have an internal calculus that says, I want to have a certain amount of short-term RA and a certain amount of longer term stuff. They try to maintain it in that way, so to the extent they have a, what I would call a border line event in a sale, that might push them one way or another. I believe that to be pretty true. And so the thing is, yes, it's 100%, but it's shorter term. They think the guy can pay it, they like it, they'll get it, they\u2019ll get him liquidated and onto something else. Aldo Pagliari : Well, that people use a metric, David, RA flips, which we don't look at it that way, but some people say, oh, RA flips if they're up, that must be bad things are coming, RA flips are actually down from the storage levels. No, again, we don't meet a lot into that, but okay. It doesn't seem like the franchisees are trying to offload credit readiness in any dramatic. Nick Pinchuk : As I mentioned, the franchise even seem flush. I mean they're kind of pretty low in terms of on hold. So I think as a network, I think the franchisees are probably in a better place than they've been in a long time. David MacGregor : Well, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on the results and good luck this quarter. Nick Pinchuk : All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Verbsky, at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-On and good day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter. I'll give you a perspective on how the virus is playing out and on the trends that we see today and going forward. And I'll speak about our physical and financial progress. Then Aldo will give you a more detailed review of the financials. To start with, I'll just say we are encouraged by the quarter it was strong. But we believe we can reach even higher. This year was -- a lot of unusual events, but when you look through it all Snap-On saw a headwinds but we met those challenges absorb the shock, develop the combinations to the environment, move forward on a clear recovery. And we believe we exited the year stronger than ever. We did have disparities from group-to-group and within each group, but our overall sales and profitability improved both sequentially, and year-over-year for the second straight quarter, achieving new heights despite the virus. Through the year, the Snap-On team continue to make progress accommodating to the threat pursuing our essential commercial opportunities safely. And moving along upward trajectory is consistent with our general projections on how the days of the virus would unfold. Geographically, the impact of the COVID continues to be varied for us. Asia Pacific remains virus challenge; Southeast Asia and India are still in deep turbulence. And while the U.S. and Europe actually seem to be further ahead and accommodation, and are moving on to what we call psychological recovery. For the business segments, we saw the essential nature of our markets rising through the turbulence along our runways for growth. Demand for vehicle repair technicians, to our franchisee network directly selling-off the vans, it was robust. Again this quarter, it was robust. Volume of repair shop owners and managers continued to gain and activity and critical industries advanced despite certain sectors like education, oil and gas, U.S. Aviation not returning to growth yet, but you would kind of affect that. Going forward, we are convinced that we're well positioned on a strong base. But we know we have much more work to do. The environment throughout the world is still impacted by the virus and many of our businesses have not yet fully recovered against the great weathering. But having recognized these headwinds however, we're also convinced that there will be abundant opportunities as the skies clear and society pivots toward suburban locations and to more individual trends transportation. This is great news for the vehicle repair industry, I got to tell you. And because of that, we're keeping focus on Snap-On value creation, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, our RCI. We've been unrelenting and advancing our advantage in products that solve the most critical tasks and brands that serve as the outward sign and our brands that serve as the outward sign of the pride and dignity working men and women take in their profession and in our people are deeply committed and very capable. Snap-On team is a great asset. And we've maintained it through these days of the virus. We've advanced each of these strengths in the turbulence, and it's enabled Snap-On to achieve new heights, and the numbers show it. That's the overview now the results. Fourth quarter, as reported sales of $1,074.4 million were up 12.5% from 2019, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translations, and $7.5 million of acquisition related sales. Organic sales will rose 10.6% volume gains in the van channel and OEM dealerships and diagnostics and repair information in our European handles business all demonstrating the abundant opportunities on our runways and our increased ability to take advantage of those opportunities. From an earnings perspective, operating net income from the quarter of $216.2 million including $2.8 million direct costs associated with the virus, $1 million of restructuring charges for actions outside the United States. And a $1.5 million hit from unfavorable currency was up 26.1%. And the OpCo operating margin it was 20.1%, 220 basis points overcoming 30 basis points of unfavorable currency 30 basis points of COVID cost impact and 10 basis points restructuring. For financial services operating income of $68.5 million increased 10.1% from 2019, all while keeping 60-day delinquencies flat the last year in the midst of the pandemic stress test. And that results combined with OpCo for consolidated operating margin of 24.4% 190 basis points point improvement. The overall quarterly EPS was $3.82, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring and that result compared to $3.08 last year, an increase of 24% I did say new height. Now for full year, sales were $3,593 million a 3.8% organic decline principally on the first and second quarter shock of the virus before the sequential gains of a combination to hold. OpCo OI is $631.9 million including $12.5 million of restructuring charges $11.9 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19 and $13.1 million of unfavorable currency compared to $716.4 million in 2019, which benefited from $11.6 million legal settlement and a patent related litigation matter. OpCo OI margin including a 30 basis point impact associated with restructuring, 30 points of direct pandemic expenses, 30 points of unfavorable currency with 17.6% and compare with 19.2% in 2019, which incorporated 30 basis points of non-recurring benefits of the legal service. That's a mouthful, right. But what it says is that despite the great disruption our full year OI margin was down only 40 basis points apples-to-apples, demonstrating the special Snap-On resilience that has enabled us to pay dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single reduction. For the year financial services registered OI of $248.6 million versus the $245.9 million in 2019. Overall EPS for the period of $11.44 was down 7.8% from the $12.41 reported last year 2019 adjusting for the restructuring and the current year and the one-time legal benefit in the prior year 2020 EPS as adjusted reached $11.52, down 5.1%. So now let's go on to the individual operating groups. In C&I volume in the quarter fourth quarter of $364.4 million including $7.5 million from acquisitions, and $6.5 million a favorable foreign currency was up 3.3% as reported. The activity was essentially flat organically, but represented a continuing sequential C&I rise all the way back to the early shot. Notably, in these numbers, the C&I year-over-year sales were marked by a strong double-digit rise in our European base hand tool business going broadly across Western Europe against the twin challenges of COVID and the Brexit disruption. They're also offsetting decreases in sales to our customers in critical industries in Asia Pacific. But both these operations join the overall growth group and registering substantial quarter-to-quarter sequential improvement. They're still down, but they're clearly recovering. From an earnings perspective, C&I, operating income of $56.2 million increased $11.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, and a $1 million of COVID related costs, with sales up 3.3% as reported flat organically, OI grew 24.9% a nice operating improvement. And the OI margin for the group was 50.4% up 260 basis points in the last year overcoming 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and 30 points of direct COVID cost, the benefits of RCI and margin gains in the critical energy industries made all the difference. Speaking to the critical industries, we did see selective gains international aviation and heavy duty registered double-digit improvements. But as you might expect, and I referenced before education, oil and gas and U.S. Aviation continue to be down. And then in the quarter our military sales will also impacted by the wind-down at one of our major fitting programs. But we do remain confident in and committed to expanding in the critical industries and we see growing opportunities moving forward and a principal path to that possibility is customer connection in innovation, creating powerful new products. You heard about our European hand tool business. It shows significant resiliency in the quarter. And it was aided by a good dose of innovation products like our recent expansion of our FIFO custom fitting system, extending our direct-to-user possibilities. Our new fitting goal product line allows buyers to quickly develop semi-bespoke kits in foam tool control consists of more than 200 pre-configured different tool sets designed around a 26 inch wide block a roll cast available in three standard foam configurations one-thirds store two-thirds store and a full door. Customers can choose the particular box drop configuration and the tool array needed right from our block a roll website reaching end users without distributor interaction, and for a wider range of specialization and sometimes it is specialization is required, our sales reps can help develop just the right unit using the full breadth of the block hole system. We've had great success with our new fitting goal. It's an important extension of our hand tool presence in Europe. And in the quarter it helped boost SNA Europe to achieve the double-digit growth in a very challenging environment. I think everybody would agree. C&I demonstrating further accommodation with continued sequential gains serving the essential each of the businesses generating a positive trajectory and exiting the quarter stronger than when they entered and product offered a big piece of that progress. Now onto the Tools Group. As reported sales up 20.2% to $494.9 million, including $2.2 million a favorable foreign currency and an $81 million or 19.6% organic increase the second straight quarter of strong game with the U.S. and international business is both growing at double-digits. And the Tools Group operating earnings $93.6 million, including $1.2 million of virus related costs, that 93.6 included $1.2 million virus related costs, and that $93.6 million compared to last year's $54.3 million and over 70% improvement. Actually, the Tools Group was recovered to positive territory for the full year. Sales were up 2% organically with OI rising almost 9% and OI margins up 110 basis points. The continue operating gains of the Tools Group are further affirmation of our view of the COVID-19 trajectory and the resilience of the vehicle repair business. And on the strength of our direct face-to-face van model, it turns out that deepened direct connection with the customers is a differentiator even in a pandemic. And in the quarter and throughout the year the Tools Group confirmed the market leading position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger. That's clear in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period, they continue to trend favorably and that was acknowledged by a number of respected publications, Snap-On as a franchise of choice. One was the franchise business review where we were again recognized and the magazine's latest rankings for franchisee satisfaction as a top 50 franchise marking the 14th consecutive year that Snap-On received that award. Now this type of recognition reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and our VAN business in general and would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new product developed through our strong customer connections. Throughout the storm, we've added every day to our already considerable insight and experience in the changing vehicle environment and because of that we're able to bring forward innovation great products like our newly released eight inch talent grip plank jaw pliers. We call it the HJ 47 ACF with a unique design for significant versatility in both removing and tightening fasteners. First, our unique plank jaw, specially designed, smooth and unsaturated meeting area allows the user to grip a hex shape only on the flat surface, positioning the load away from the corners. That's similar to our flank drive systems on sockets, 30% more torch applied to the fastener while still minimizing damages, eliminating rounded edges. Second, when the fasteners have already been heavily rounded and are tough to grip. Our talent grip diamond serrated jaws jointed located as the pliers tip generate unparalleled clamping force it's up to a 57% increase in turning power. With the Snap-On talent, technicians can remove even the most damaged and rounded hex fasteners and for the icing on the versatility cake, the new pliers also feature a patented three position slip joint designed for easy changes to the grip position, the HD 47 ACF, manufacturing right here and I'm going to walk you to the plant in the U.S. and it's been very well received putting it on a clear path to becoming another one of our hit products $1 million selling products just in one quarter. We also worked hard during the COVID to maintain and further strengthen our brand, celebrating our 100 year continuing our presence in racing and serve, most importantly I think servicing our customers every-day reinforcing that what they do really is essential and that the display the Snap-On brand confirms that it's sold. Sometimes the Tools Groups also been working to Span franchisee selling capacity. And that effect continued with focus to the pandemic and the days of the early shot access to the shops and to the technicians vary widely and the Tools Group more to engage social media in bridging the gap. This turned into a powerful tool for pre-briefing customers on products and promotions, reserving the actual face-to-face interaction for closing the deal, providing significant franchisee opportunity for selling more products and reaching new customers. The tools we've also made strides and redeploying the time saved from restricted travel, everybody stay-at-home work today streamlining the VAN sales process to RCI and developing more concise customer presentation. So important in pitching products of ever rising complexity, social media engagement, RCI, selling and more effective trading. It made the difference, raising franchisee selling capacity to match the strength and capacity of our new product and the results back it up. Well, that's the Tools Group. Moving through a V shaped recovery, recording two straight quarters of double-digit expansion, continuing a stream of new products building the brand raising selling capacity and strengthening for the future. Now let's speak of RS&I. The RS&I Group continuing the combination and extending its positive trend sales at $361.1 million in the fourth quarter up 7.8%, 7% organically excluding $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency a steep recovery from the depths of the pandemic. The rise was due to double-digit gains and OEM dealerships as auto manufacturers began to release new models and launched more essential programs. A high single-digit gain in the sales of our of our powerful diagnostics and repair information products independent repair shop owners and managers and then offsetting low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment or garage owners haven't developed sufficient confidence to invest to get it invest broadly and upgrading or expanding their facilities. RS&I operating earnings of $90 million improved $2.8 million as the mix of lower margin OEM project sales diluted the volume improvement and as the group recorded a $1 million in charges for small European focused restriction. On a diagnostics and information based operations have recorded continuous growth for some time, the sales to independent repair shop owners and managers they've had continuous growth for some time, and innovative new products are the key to that success. And the fourth quarter was no exception. We just began shipping our new 20.4 software update for our diagnostics platforms in North America full coverage for the 2020 vehicles. Additional reprogramming facility, increased functional test capabilities, and an expansion of our unique advanced driver assistance or ADAS content, so critical these days for engaging vehicle automation. This software represents another move forward in our already powerful already market leading intelligent diagnostics and repair information product lines. And that's been well received. 1,000s of technicians all across the U.S. and Canada will be upgrading to this very capable new edition before the next update is released in May. And then we'll start again. RS&I is building a powerful position in the vehicle repairs and vehicle repair software that meets the changing mobility environment. And the 20.4 is another step in that direction. We're confident in the strength of RS&I, and we keep driving to Spanish physician repair shop owners and managers making work easier with great new products even in the days of the virus. And that's our fourth quarter, absorbing the shock, driving accommodation, moving on to psychological recovery, keeping our people safe while we serve the essential all of that is working. Building Snap-On's advantage and the results show us sequential gains from the third quarter and significant growth from last year. Sales up 12.5%, 10.6% organically OI margin 20.1%, 220 basis points higher financial services continuing to deliver navigating the virus with strength and without disruptions and EPS up $3.82 up 24% all achieved, while maintaining and expanding our advantages and product brands and people ending the year stronger ready for more opportunities to come. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. The fourth quarter of 2020 was strong with respect to Snap-On\u2019s financial performance. Sales development was robust both year-over-year and sequentially. Gross profit and operating earnings margins expanded, and cash flow generation was again healthy net sales of $1,074.4 million in the quarter compared to $955.2 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $7.5 billion of acquisition related sales. The organic increase principally reflected double-digit growth across the Snap-On tool segment, and high single-digit gains with repair shop owners and managers in the repair systems and information segment. We've began identified direct costs associated with COVID-19, which totaled $2.8 million this quarter. These costs include direct labor and under absorption associated with temporary factory closures, wages for quarantines associates event cancellation fees, as well as other costs to accommodate the current enhanced health and safety environment. Also in the quarter, we recorded $1 million of restructuring cost actions for Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48% compared to 47.2% last year, the 80 basis point improvement primarily reflects the higher sales volume and benefits and the company's RCI initiatives partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.9% improved 140 basis points from 29.3% last year, primarily reflecting the impact of the higher sales, which more than offset the 30 basis points related to restructuring and direct costs associated with COVID-19. Operating earnings before financial services of $216.2 million, including $2.8 million of direct costs associated with COVID-19, $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $171.4 million in 2019, reflecting a 26.1% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales operating margin before financial services of 20.1%, including 30 basis points of direct cost associated to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects improve 220 basis points from 17.9% last year. As you may know, Snap-On operates on a fiscal calendar, which results in an additional week to our fiscal full year and fourth quarter every six years. As a result, our 2020 fiscal year contains 53 weeks of operating results with the extra week relative to the prior year occurring in the fourth quarter. While the impact of this additional week was not material to Snap-On\u2019s consolidated fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings, our financial services segment did earn an additional week of interest income on its financing portfolio. At the consolidated level, the net earnings benefit from the additional week of financial services interest income was largely offset by a corresponding additional week of fixed expenses, primarily personnel related costs and interest expense. With that said, financial services revenue of $93.4 million in the quarter of 2020 compared to $83.9 million last year, primarily reflecting the extra week of interest income and the growth in the financial services portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $68.5 million increase $6.3 million for 2019 levels, principally due to the higher revenue but partially offset by increased variable compensation and other costs. Consolidated operating earnings of $284.7 million including $2.8 million of direct COVID related costs $1 million of restructuring costs and $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $233.6 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.4% compared to 22.5% in 2019. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.8% compared to 22.3% last year. Finally, net earnings of $208.9 million or $3.82 per diluted share, including a $0.02 charge for restructuring increased $38.3 million or $0.74 per share from 2019 levels representing a 24% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results, starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.4 million increased 3.3% from $352.9 million last year reflecting $7.5 million of acquisition related sales and $6.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation partially offset by a seven-tenths of 1% organic sales declining. While organic sales were essentially flat as compared to last year, they did improve sequentially in a more meaningful manner than what we see in our typical seasonal patterns, with organic sales of 14.6% from the third quarter of 2020. As compared to last year, the organic sales declined primarily reflects a mid single-digit decrease in our Asia Pacific operations, and a low single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries, offset by double-digit gains in the segments European based hand tools business. Within Asia similar to last quarter, sales to customers in India and Southeast Asia continue to be impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Across critical industries, while year-over-year sales declined in natural resources including oil and gas, U.S. Aviation and Technical Education. Sales into these markets have improved from third quarter comparisons. This quarter\u2019s year-over-year gains were reflected across international aviation heavy duty and non-military government related activity. Sales to the U.S. military were lower as compared to the prior year as the fourth quarter of 2019 included sales for a major project that is winding down. Sales increases in our European based hand tool business were heaven across the region, particularly in France and the United Kingdom, as well as in our Scandinavian and export markets. Gross Margin of 37.8% improved 230 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increased sales and higher gross margin businesses and declines in lower gross margin sales to the military, as well as from benefits of RCI initiatives. These increases were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 20 basis points of direct COVID-19 costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales 22.4% from 30 basis points as compared to last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $56.2 million, including $1.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects and $1 million of direct COVID-19 costs compared to $45 million last year. The operating margin of 15.4% compared to 12.8% a year ago. Turning down to Slide 8, sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $494.9 million increased 20.2% from $411.7 million in 2019 reflecting a 19.6% organic sales gain and $2.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects double-digit gains in both our U.S. and international operations. This reflects a 9.5% organic sequential gain over a strong third quarter 2020 sales performance. Gross margin of 42.9% in the quarter improved 270 basis points, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved from 27% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment actions, which more than offset $1 million or 30 basis points of COVID-19 related costs. Operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $93.6 million compared to $54.3 million last year. The operating margin of 18.9% compared to 13.2% a year ago, an increase of 570 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9, sales of $361.1 million compared to $335 million a year ago reflecting a 7% organic sales gain and $2.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a double-digit gain sales to OEM dealerships, particularly in sales related to OEM facilitation programs and a high single-digit increase in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. These increases were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment. Sequentially RS&I organic sales improved by 13.2%. Gross Margin of 46.1%, including 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, declined 160 basis points from last year primarily due to the impact have higher sales and lower gross margin businesses including facilitation program related sales to OEM dealerships. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.2%, including 30 basis points of cost from restructuring improved 50 basis points from 21.7% last year, largely reflecting the mix of business activity in the quarter. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $90 million, compared to $87.2 million last year, the operating margins at 24.9%, including the effects of 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects and 10 basis points of direct costs associated with COVID-19 compared to 26% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from financial services of $93.4 million compared to $83.9 million last year. This includes the additional days of accrued interest associated with a 53rd week in our 2020 fiscal calendar. Financial services operating earnings of $68.5 million, compared to $62.2 million in 2019. Financial services expenses of $24.9 million increased $3.2 million from last year's levels, primarily due to higher variable compensation and other costs partially offset by a year-over-year decrease in provisions for credit losses. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, provisions for credit losses were lower by $700,000, while net charge-offs and bad debts were lower by $1.3 million. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the average yield and finance receivables is 17.7% in 2020 compared to 17.5% in 2019. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 9.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operations support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the quarter, approximately $13 million of these business operating support loans remain outstanding. Total loan originations of $272.4 million in the quarter increased $10 million or 3.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a 4.5% increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were essentially flat. Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. In the fourth quarter, our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $20.8 million, the 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for the United States, extended credit is unchanged from last year and reflects the seasonal increase we typically experienced in the fourth quarter. As relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12 months net losses of $45.6 million represented 2.62% of outstandings at quarter end, down 8 basis points sequentially and down 29 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $317.6 million in the quarter increased $120.9 million from comparable 2019 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities including a $53.5 million decrease in working investment, primarily driven by inventory reductions in the period. Net cash used by investing activities of $73.6 million included $35.4 million for the acquisition of auto grid, capital expenditures of $26.5 million and net additions to finance receivables of $15.9 million. Free cash flow during the quarter of $275.2 million was 129% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $111.6 million, including cash dividends of $66.8 million and the repurchase of 460,000 shares of common stock for $78.7 million under our existing share repurchase program. Full year 2020 share repurchases totaled 1.109 shares for $174.3 million. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $275.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable decreased $53.9 million from 2019 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 64 days compared to 67 days of 2019 year-end. Inventories decreased $13.9 million from 29 year-end including a $40.1 million inventory reduction, partially offset by increases from $23.2 million of currency translation and $3 million from acquisitions. On a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.6 in year-end 2019, and 2.4 at the end of the third quarter 2020. Year-end cash position of $923.4 million compared to $184.5 million a year in 2019. Our net debt to capital ratio of 12.1% compared to 22.1% at year-end 2019. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate the absence of any changes to U.S. Tax Legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I'll turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Snap-On fourth quarter, we're encouraged by where we've been and by where we're going. You see, we believe that we exit 2020 stronger more capable and more advantaged than when we entered the year. The virus came, we absorb the shock. We accommodated the turbulence and we forged a V shaped recovery as we anticipated in the depths of the difficulty. We believe the year is vivid testimony to Snap-On resilience into our ability in turning change and challenge to our advantage. And the fourth quarter performance says it's so. Sales up 12.5% as reported 10.6% organically OI margin 20.1% or 220 basis points against 30 basis points of unfavorable currency 10 basis points of restructuring charges and 30 basis points of direct COVID costs, strong improve. C&I sale, clear sequential gains OI margin of 15.4% rising 260 points, RSI sales up 7% organically, OI of 24.9% down, but still in heavy territory. Financial services revenue and profits all up portfolio solid in the storm. And finally, the Tools Group, sales are up 19.6% organically profits up 72.4% OI margin of 18.9% rising 570 basis points good numbers. But more importantly, underscoring our belief that the franchisee selling capacity has expanded and is positioned for more gains. And all of that it all came together to offer an EPS in the quarter of $3.82 up 24% from 2019 new heights in the great turbulence of 2020. And these heights were achieved while still nurturing our product, our brand, our people preserving and amplifying our natural advantages. We do believe we will leave the year at full and expanded strength and ready to reach higher and farther amid the abundant opportunities a 2021 and the years beyond. Before I turn the call over the operator. I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. We celebrate your contributions as you perform your central task, and we're confident your effort in preserving our society will be remembered for years to come. For your success in altering the encouraging results of our fourth quarter, you have my congratulations. And for your steadfast commitment to our present and for your unwavering belief in our future. You have my thanks. Now turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Scott Stember with C.L. King. Scott Stember : Good morning guys and congratulations on a very strong quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. Aldo Pagliari : Thank you. Scott Stember : Particularly when you look at the Tools Group and if you look at the year-over- year number, I think you said, organically up 2% looks like you've essentially offset what you lost during the COVID period. But can you just frame out, how much of that was catch-up, and how much of that, is there a new incremental layer of growth? You talked about, people not traveling and being around and easy, I guess, some positive things coming, just your views on the Tools Group? Nick Pinchuk : I think the story of the Tools Group is they took the COVID. And if you look at the endpoints, they're unaffected, what I mean, if you look at the endpoints are pretty good. And I think part of it is, sure they got shocked, and they had to accommodate, but they came back. And that's really the story of the corporation. But if you want to talk about recovery, I think, certainly in the third quarter, we had some recovery, we're coming out of those deep days of the virus in the end of the first quarter and second quarter. Fourth quarter, it's harder to judge that. We think the expanding capacity and the impact of the new products coming out of the SFC drove things. Now, you can step back and look at one other thing is that, if you attempted to think about that, realize that sales of the VAN kind of matched of, and sales of the van were up, significantly more than the sales to the VAN in the year. So I would say things are kind of chugging along, we can talk about what's up and down and so on. We think the Tools Group is in good shape. We think its product is where it is. And that's why I spent time on the discussion talking about expanding the capabilities of our franchisees because we said that there are two boundaries to the Tools Group, it's time and space. And we think we broke them through some of the time. Scott Stember : Got it. So just again, you said that it was up significantly more than the selling, just to make sure I heard that correctly. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, significant more than Tools Group. If you look at the full year, of the VAN was more than to the VAN, and in the better, it changes from month-to-month, but generally kept pace even in the best course, best periods. Scott Stember : Yes, and again, your view longer term hasn't changed mid single-digit growth for this segment. Just to clarify that? Nick Pinchuk : That haven't changed, I think we get, let's take one step at a time and get back to where we want to be. We said we're 46% growth and will grow as a corporation, the Tools Group at the bottom of that. It\u2019s a great profitable business. We think it's positioned for growth. We'll just take that one quarter at a time, but we're feeling good. Scott Stember : Got it. And then last question, within tools. Did you talk about how big ticket did versus hand tools? Let me just clarify that a little more. Nick Pinchuk : Hand tools was stronger, which is one of the great things we're innovating in hand tools. This is an interesting that in a complex environment like this hand tools and we've seen it forever hand tools are a great business. But the big ticket items continue to go it's particularly diagnostics, this particular quarter were nice and strong. But it's also a tool -- and Tools Group is up. But in any kind of environment coming out of the difficulty, like we saw in the financial recession, people take a little time to fully get into psychological recovery, and they're willing to pay for, or invest in longer payback is. So you're seeing that coming along. Scott Stember : Got it. That's all I have. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : Thanks, and good morning, guys. First question, Nick. Just wondering if you could follow up on sales of the VAN versus your sales in the fourth quarter specifically, should we assume that outlines, that you just provided relative to the full year and sort of the general shape of that as we went through the year overall? Nick Pinchuk : No. So, I don't want to get into that. I don't want to start another reporting number for myself. But the sales of the van were up strong double-digits. Luke Junk : Fair enough. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, okay. And that that followed month-by-month. So we're not seeing any sale off necessarily. We like the momentum. Luke Junk : Okay, I'll leave that one there. Second question that I wanted to ask is if you could expand on the comments that he made on the software side, Nick, in terms of the ADAS content that you rolled out I just want to understand -- what that capability is. Nick Pinchuk : Okay I will you that, I tell you. One of the things, I talked about the sales of that information and diagnostic store repair shop owners or managers and independent shops, and one of the cornerstones of that lately is in Mitchell 1 is the ADAS software, which allows people to deal with difficulties of programming and understanding what's wrong with when you have a bridge in the advanced driver systems and as cars go to more autonomous this is even going to bigger. And so that Mitchell 1 has been one of the solid ones. If you go back and look at it, that segment has that portion has been pretty solid throughout the COVID. And that's one of the things driving it is the demand for these products. If automakers were going to go to highly automated cars, I kiss them tomorrow, because our business gets even better because precision is needed. And that's evidence of it. Luke Junk : And then last question for Aldo, if I could. Just wondering if you could comment on higher steel pricing that we're seeing right now and your ability to offset that both operationally and through pricing actions, given the strength that you're seeing the Tools Group, especially right now? Aldo Pagliari : Well, certainly we always do believe when there's invisible and -- visible inflation, I should say that we have the pricing power to deal with it. That said, yes, there's increases in the steel horizon, it takes a few months for them to come into the company, because obviously you buy in order some inventories in the past months, and you have them in line to arrive. So there's a trailing effect that's there. But historically, if you look back, Luke, we've had these types of gyrations in steel from time-to-time, and we deal with it, we do have pricing power, then again, I remind everyone Snap-On is very vertically integrated. So in a way, the good news factor is steel is not as much a percent of the final end product, as some people might imagine. So I think that actually does work to our benefit to some degree. Luke Junk : Great, thank you for the color. I'll leave it there. Nick Pinchuk : Right, good. Operator : We will take our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Nick, congratulations on the good numbers, strong quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. David MacGregor : Help me understand, why the spread between tools segment organic growth and the origination numbers is again this quarter in the mid-teens. And you called that diagnostics, being strong, I think you may have even said double-digits. So I'm really struggling to understand that, but\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : I didn't actually say double-digit just to be clear. I don't think we could read. Sometimes I say things I don't remember. But certainly I don't think I said at that time. Look what here is the thing, you like to ask that question. Of course, that originations are divorced in time from what we sell to the VANS. And so what we're talking about is selling to the VANS. And so you have that divorce. But like I said, our hand tools are stronger in this quarter than others because people haven't been investing in big ticket items as much. But the big ticket items are still up diagnostics was strong. And diagnostic is kind of a mix, it doesn't all go to EC, they increasingly because as the franchisees get more well heeled, they often use them on revolving accounts, sort of put them on their 15 week deal or they may stretch it a little bit. They don't go to EC. So we get a mix of those things. So if you're trying to figure out where origination is going to go, you have time displacement. And you have the split of EC between RA I mean, but diagnostics between RA and EC, and then you have tool storage on top of that. So it would be fair to say though, that, as I said before the overall big ticket items wasn't as robust as the overall tool sales. David MacGregor : Sure. I mean, you call that sell through off the truck in the fourth quarter up double, I think there you did say up double-digits, and it was a strong and\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : I did. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. David MacGregor : And the strong cadence through the quarter. I mean, on the surface, when you see that greater disparity between organic growth and tools in the originations number, it would look like there was an inventory build on the trucks. Nick Pinchuk : No, I don't think so. We don't think that look, here's the thing. I think I'm saying this, I think if it lines up perfectly, the sales off the truck and to the truck kind of line up, all right. In fact, maybe for the full year, the sales off the truck are higher. So there's an inventory shrink, I guess, in macro. And secondly, what I'm saying is sales to the truck are more weighted to smaller ticket items, because people invest in the shorter paybacks in these times. But that doesn't mean that the big ticket Mullingar diagnostics was strong. We like diagnostics, but I'm not giving a total number. David MacGregor : Right. And then what was the impact of the extra week on organic growth in the tool segment? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, it's kind of immaterial, really, because, the extra week is between New Year's and Christmas. And you got holidays and you got people relaxing and those periods so it doesn't really make much difference. It might be I think, actually, we in OpCo anyway, we lose money in that week. So at the expenses, and we don't have much sales. David MacGregor : So a typical week would be about $40 million in revenues. Would it be half of that? Nick Pinchuk : No less. David MacGregor : Less than half of that, okay. Nick Pinchuk : This happens, whatever, this happens every year the same way. We don't have that week, but that week is the same every year. David MacGregor : Okay, last question for me. I guess on the cost savings at the SG&A line specifically, within the tool segment expenses were down about 300 basis points. So nice to see that pretty good number. By contrast in the C&I segment, your expenses were down about 30 bips and then RS&I down about 50. So I guess the question is, what are we able to cut back on and tools that may not have presented the same opportunity in the other two segments? And how much of that I don't know, could cost 250 basis points of discrepancy comes back with normalized conditions in \u201821? Nick Pinchuk : I don't know. Look, I think one of the reasons is, of course, the Tools Group is much more heavily direct. And so because we're selling direct through our franchise, we're selling with our franchisees, we're out there travel and services, I mean, the normal years, and so we're out, we're kind of forward placed in tools more than others, so we like to be in the other places. So you would expect that to be a more target rich situation, especially in a situation with travels restricted in. And as far as going backward, I don't know, I think if your any operating business, you're feathered back these operations, you want to go out reach people when the sky is clear. Your guess is as good as mine. When the sky is clear, and you're going to work, they're going to be feathered in. I don't know if it will I doubt if it will all come back. But some of it will come back. I can't give you any guidance on it, though, really? Because we -- we're going to play it period-by-period. David MacGregor : Okay, thanks. I'll get out of the way and turn it over to others. Thanks, Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Okay, thanks. Operator : We will take our next question from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle : Thanks very much. So, I know you guys don't give guidance in terms of any of the operating numbers, but maybe just a little insight, I guess, if you could, in terms of kind of how you're planning out or budgeting the year for the Tools Group, I guess vis-\u00e0-vis things like miles driven what I think should be a recovering environment for things like collision and other auto work? I wasn't sort of framing I guess if you see 2021? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, look miles driven. Everybody makes a big deal about miles driven. But we never see motion, miles driven short-term. I don't think it plays out what we've learned is, since we've had over the last few years put a bigger in collision, it plays out in the collision business. So you're very right. I mean, collision is down significantly as an industry year-over-year. And we see that and you're seeing it that in our equipment, numbers that isn't in the Tools Group numbers so much. You might see some garages, the odd, the garages we visit, but isn't a big factor in that situation. Miles driven, I think it's not so much the short-term, but we think longer term, it's going to start going up and that going to be more cars, because people are going to go to individual vehicles, who wants to get on a subway, how many people want to live in a 47 -- work in a 40 storey building in the future? Maybe you guys I don't know. But I think there's going to be a motion a reversal of that we saw that in China. So we see car ownership and miles driven in a long way of getting better. And that drives our business what that means for us in 2021, unclear, but we think its opportunity. Now we think it's opportunity in the longer term, we're going to play out quarter-by-quarter, what I will tell you is we feel good about the momentum we've had going through the year, closing out the year. We feel good about that. We feel good about how our products are being received. We feel good about the efficacy of our software in the complex business. We feel good about the idea that our VAN drivers have more time so that's what I would say. Curtis Nagle : Okay, fair enough. And then maybe just a quick follow up. I guess any notable changes in terms of the underlying health on the tech population, technician population in terms of income, which I think is still pretty good? Nick Pinchuk : Actually income is up. But wages, I'll say that, I'll say the wages are up trailing 12 months and year-over-year in November, we will be less logistic. So, you view that from which you will but it\u2019s up a couple 3%. So the wages are up nicely, so the technicians aren't suffering and they think, I've talked to several franchisees yesterday, and they all think positive about their customer base. So that's pretty good. And we had our kickoffs and I zoomed in to the watch parties in Pennsylvania, in Florida and Iowa and in New York, and they were all positive about their customers. So I think the technicians are being affected. In fact, maybe they're doing better. Curtis Nagle : And you said, this is kind of, slow moving, maybe slow turning things. But in terms of the ongoing shortages in terms of tax any improvement there with employment? Nick Pinchuk : Here is what I'll tell you, is that we're involved in that. We think that's an opportunity for us. And of course, we're working on that and for in listing people in career and technical education. And what we do is we establish Snap-On education sector is down, but we think it's been a boon for us, because we've been investing in education, and our number of certified centers, the education centers that offer Snap-On certification programs increased 33% in 2020 from 133 to 177. So we think we're in good shape in that situation. So I think technicians are going to come I think people are working on it. I'm particularly kind of optimistic about the President because his wife, Dr. Joe Biden is in technical education. So I think it'll get a good focus. Curtis Nagle : All right, sounds good. Good luck on the quarter and thank you very much. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Bret Jordan : I am going to sort of trying to reconcile the tools growth with originations, are you seeing that maybe mechanics are using other sources of credit? Given their lack of spending on vacations or restaurants other entertainment? Nick Pinchuk : I don't know, maybe you'll never know, I don't think we're seeing that. I haven't heard that anyway. Bret Jordan : You're not seeing a cash buyer pick up, I guess. Nick Pinchuk : What does happen though, is as our franchisees get more flush they tend to reach up. Franchisees are healthier. And they tend to reach up into the lower end of the what we would call bigger ticket items, particularly in a diagnostic segment. So the big hitter, one of our baby boomers is the Apollo D9 and it's kind of for the everyman technician in the middle of the range. And that's the thing that really did well in the quarter. And that one can be financed by a technician, by a franchisee. So maybe we're seeing some of that, and that one we introduced, I think at the SFC, it gets rolling out we gave demonstration units. It's outselling its predecessor by about 25% in terms of activations and so it's looking pretty good. So maybe that heading this, but I just want to caution that it's hard to reconcile in the end period, originations with what sales we have to the van that's another factor. There are a bunch of factors that are dislocating in that way. Over time, it should be directionally. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then I guess a question on share gains obviously, some really strong quarters back-to-back in tool the full year just got to go up a couple percent. But do you feel that there's any shift in market share in your favor right now or is the market overall particularly strong? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think, look, I think vehicle I think our markets are overall strong, they're critical repair in particular being they're critical. They're critical. And they're essential and particular vehicle repair that underpins our critical mobility in the nation. But, and I don't really like to talk about market share, but what I'll tell you is, my franchisees are telling us that I said in my speech, that we are benefiting from being there through thick and thin. We were there every day in almost every day in the pandemic, anytime anybody would meet us, our guys were out there safely. And that has accrued to us. So for that turns into market share, I guess you can interpret it how you will. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Aldo Pagliari : Sure, thanks Bret. Operator : And we will take our final question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Kind of a narrow question, but maybe illustrative of how you operate. Nick you mentioned, growth in international aviation, even double-digit pretty adds-on with the context of that margin. So is that kind of a startup initiative or is it up a decent base just looking for a little bit more? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look our international business is not fully equal to the U.S. business in aviation critical industries, but it's a reasonable comparison. This isn't like $300,000 and we doubled it to 600. That's not it. So generally that business I think, broad aviation is enough to bring aviation in total sort of up. So I mean, it's a good business. All I can say is go figure. Where we're getting. I guess it's a credit to the quality of our tools, the importance. Now remember, one of the things we've done in industrial that has got us, I think, got great popularity is we're leaning more and more on this customized kits. I talked about it, that\u2019s in Europe, and we were banging those customers. It was gangbusters on a customized kits for the last several quarters and we are expanding capacity in that. In fact, that's one of the investments next year we're looking at to expand our capacity and customize kits and international aviation is part of it. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thank you. Operator : Now I would like to turn the call back to Sara Verbsky for any additional or closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-On. Good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, they are encouraging, on our markets they're standing firm and, on our progress, it's made us stronger than ever before. And we'll also speak about what it all means. We believe it means we're getting better and better position for more even while we're still in the midst of a once in a 100-year pandemic. After all that Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. We believe our first quarter is clear confirmation of Snap-on's ability to continue its trajectory of positive results, further accommodating to the virus environment, overcoming periods of period variations from business-to-business, dealing with macroeconomic headwinds and advancing along our runways for both growth and improvement. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.246 billion were up 20.2%, including 19.2 million a favorable foreign exchange and 11.3 million of acquisition related sales. Organic sales growth was 16.3% gains in every group. It's our third straight, straight quarter of being above our pre-pandemic levels and ongoing contributions from our Strap-on value creation processes. The principles we use every day safety quality, customer connection, innovation, and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. They all combine to drive that progress, progress there was. OpCo operating income of 200.9 9 million was up 62 million from last year, which included 7.5 million of restructuring charges. OpCo operating margin was 19.6% up from the 2020 level of 16.3% or 17.2% as adjusted for restructuring. For financial services, operating income of 65.3 million increased 14.8% and the delinquencies were down even in the midst of a pandemic stress test during a commercial trial of what we would call extraordinary proportion. And that results combined with OpCo for a consolidated operating margin of 23.9% a 300 basis point improvement as reported and up 220 basis points as adjusted. First Quarter EPS was $3.50 up 40.6% from last year's 240 and exploding the 2020 restructuring charges EPS grew 34.6%. I said it before and I'll say it again. We believe Snap-on's stronger now than when we entered the great weathering. And we also believe that our first quarter results testify to just that, especially when we compare them to 2019 before the virus, so let's do that. Versus 2019, our sales in the past quarter grew 102.9 million or 11.2% that reflects 15.3 million of acquisition related sales, 11.6 million a favorable foreign currency and a $76 million or 8.1% economic gain. The 2021 OpCo operating margin of 19.6% was up 50 basis points from 2019 level as adjusted for a legal settlement in that earlier period. And that 50 point gain was achieved against 80 points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while still absorbing the COVID. Now to our markets, auto repair remains quite resilient, the technicians are rolling. They know they've weathered the depths of the COVID shock and have learned to accommodate the virus environment and are moving to psychological recovery. There's still some air of vigilance. But their activities are robust. And they know they won't be shocked again by a spike. They're quite positive regarding the future of driving as people pivot from shared mobility to individual transportation. And it's - vehicle repair with the technicians is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it, you can hear it in our franchisees voices, and you can see it written clearly across our double-digit numbers. Also on auto repair, there are shop owners and managers. There are signs that the auto business is rising. Demand for new cars is high but dealership repair and maintenance and warranty is still attenuated. So there is a gradual gain, and we're positioned to take advantage with a broader and stronger product line with innovations like our TRITON-D10 diagnostics and new acquisitions like Dealer-FX, putting us deeper into dealerships than ever before, and providing us a clearer view of the future repair trends, new technologies and evolving vehicle platforms. Dealer-FX puts us at the right place at the right time as thing change. Finally, let's talk about critical industries, where Snap-on rules out of the garage solving tasks of consequence. This is where C&I operates the most international of our operations and these are the customers that have been most impacted by the virus. They're slower to accommodate and to recover, but they have been recovering. And in the quarter the results showed that trend, despite some significant headwinds, including the continuing impact of the virus, the February freeze in Texas, some challenged business sectors like oil and gas, and troubled geographies, like Southeast Asia. Despite that variation, we did see growth in critical industries, improvement in a number of areas in aviation, in education, in heavy duty fleet. They all combined to overcome the continuing turbulence in natural resources. Also in C&I, SNA Europe, another quarter of double-digit growth, with broad strength across the geographies in places like France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the Nordic Region and from our Asia Pacific division, up double digits as well with solid increases in key countries like China and India and Japan. So overall, I describe our C&I markets is improving and representing clear opportunity, and coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there's clear overall progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding to repair shop owners and managers, extended critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product line, wielding or strengthening brand, and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-on people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock. About a year ago as we entered the virus, we recognized the resilience of our markets and the strength of our model, projecting a B recovery. And that's how it played out. You can see it in the results. So now let's turn to the segments and discuss those results. In the C&I group on a reported basis, including 9.2 million favorable foreign currency translation, and 7.3 million of acquisition related sales, first Quarter volume rose 15.3% compared to last year. Organic sales were up 9.5%. Double digit growth in our European hand tool business and a mid-single digit rise in critical industries led the way. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of 50.7 million including 1.4 million of unfavorable currency represents a rise of 19.2 million compared to the 31.5 million registered in 2020, which included 4.4 million of restructuring. That all means on an adjusted basis an adjusted increase of over 40% and as adjusted increase of over 40% and the operating margin was 14.7% and as reported increase of 420 basis points, and 290 as adjusted. Now, when compared with 2019, the pandemic free measuring stick sales were up 7.2% and that includes 10 million or 3.1% organic gain, 8 million of acquisitions and 5.2 million for favorable foreign currency. Once again C&I demonstrated sequential improvement. If you go back and look at those numbers, they keep getting closer and closer and now they're above pre-pandemic levels. Despite the ongoing uncertainty, it's one of the things I think we want to remember the virus isn't gone and was still bearing it and we didn't have it in 2019 and C&I is above that level. As part of the trend, we remain committed to extending in critical industries. That's the C&I sweet spot. So we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise. And enabling that attempt intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products developed specially to make critical work easier. One example is our CT9010 3 inches drive 18 volt brushless impact wrench, the newest member of our MonsterLithium family, aimed at tight spaces, sustained power, rugged durability, and precise control. The 9010 features 320 pound feet of bolt break-away torque and 240 pound feet of working torque all the power of technician needs when they're working in confirmed quarters. It offers a variable speed trigger and three speed selections in forward and reverse. That means greater control adaptable to any applications and no over torquing important. The 9010 advanced design also reduces motor temperature rise to delivering higher durability and great power to weight ratio. It's managed fitted with a 100 lumen headlight that helps technicians work in dark environments. Just what's needed for those close jobs. And the 18volt battery with the five amp hours ensures consistent output and extended run time, which translates to less charging and more efficient work day. And all this comes and this is the best part I think, all of this comes in an extremely compact size or only six and three quarter inches in overall length that will fit into the tightest of work space. The ct 9010 is a great tool. It's had strong demand, and it's already one of our $1 million hit products. I don't want to leave C&I without mentioning SNA Europe. Double digit sales growth again, progress by the overall tool management system, expanding product customization to the needs of the task, driving progress across - against the twin headwinds of a difficult COVID environment. Europe is not so easy these days and the uncertainty of Brexit, no small feat. Well that's C&I, continuing the sequential improvement and position for more. Now onto the tools group, sales a 478.3 million up 102.4 million including 6.7 million of favorable currency and a 95.7 million or 25% organic gain, double digit growth both in the US in the international operations, the operating margin was 20.7%. Yes, 20.7% up 780 basis points, compared with pre-virus to 2019, tools group sales grew 68.1 million, 16.6% including 5.2 million favorable currency translation and 62.9 million or 15.1% organic gain. And this year's 20.7 operating margin was up 430 basis points compared with pre-pandemic 2019. The tools group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands and further enabling its franchisees and the results show it. We do believe our runway for coherent growth enhancing the franchise. Franchise network represents a continuing opportunity and there's evidence that we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel in our franchisee metrics, the financial and physical indicators that we monitor closely. Again this quarter they remain clearly favorable. And based on those metrics, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger. And they say so in our direct interactions at events like this past January's kickoff meeting held this year at a distance. It was a great affair. Well attended strong orders, visible commitment to our brand, watch parties all over the country. I zoomed into several myself and they were brimming with enthusiasm and optimism. Our franchisees, entrepreneurs and professionals all are pumped, confident and reaching higher. The tools group quarter, that's a strong advantage for us. The tools group quarter was also marked with Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation. Offering new products sometimes just an improvement on an established line, but clearly making work easier solving problems, delivering productivity gains. All of these are born out of observing the changing work in shops on an everyday basis. We're in those shops every day. We watch the work. We offer the products. One such add is our KERN681, 7-Drawer Single Bank EPIQ Series Roll Cab, configured entirely with extra wide 62 inch drawers, greater flexibility and capacity and a standard footprint making the most of limited shop space. Our franchisees are already calling it uninterrupted storage. It's the first large capacity roll cab paired with a full complement of extra wide drawers in the industry. To me Algona, Iowa plant I saw some of being made there just last month and the local team is proud of them. It comes with two swivel and two rigid casters located right on the corners of the box, doesn't seem like much of a change. But that's a clever innovation that provides mobility and tight spaces while also greatly enhancing box stability. That's a very important feature for a high capacity unit. The KERN681 epic strength, styling and styling 8000 pounds of low capacity and more than 45,000 cubic inches of storage space. The franchisees are saying it's been a clear hit and they're right. We spent some time over several quarters working to expand franchisees selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training, and RCI and van operations. So that's paid off, selling capacity is up, and you can see it clearly in the three straight gangbusters quarters for our tools group. I don't need to say any more about them. Now let's speak about RS&I, first quarter organic sales rose 7.6% with varying gains across the board. Undercar equipment coming back delivering double digit rise, diagnostics and information products, independent repair shops growing at mid single digits and the business focused on OEM dealerships, advancing low single digits. Operating earnings of 81.4 million, including 1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects increased 4.1 million from 2020, which included 3.1 million of restructuring costs. Compared with 2019 sales grew 19.7 million or 6% including 10 million or 3.1% organic gain, 7.3 million from acquisitions and 2.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency. We clearly see the potential and a runway for growth in the RS&I group expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. RSI's organic growth in the quarter was broad based, but the double digit rise in undercar equipment was especially welcome turn and was led by innovative products like our newly introduced Tru-Point ADAS calibration system. Advanced driver assistance systems or ADAS are active and passive aids to keep vehicle passengers safe, things like collision avoidance, lane departure warnings, automatic parking and crosswind stabilization. These new features are great. But what's really music to our ears is that they require periodic calibrations to make sure they're working with precision and calibrations can be complicated. Sensors and cameras vary considerably across vehicle makes and models and if you get a faulty recalibration, it leads to rework and it's not good for safety. So our new John Bean 2.8 ADAS calibration system is the fix, making sure the vehicle is physically aligned correctly, guiding calibration of the sensors and documenting that the procedure was performed - formed appropriately. And it does so for the multitude of makes and models seen regularly in OEM and aftermarket shops. The new Tru-Point is easy to use. It requires minimal training. It compensates for the floor regularities that are so common in garages and big devils alignment and calibration is quick and efficient. And it's OEM compliance. It's a powerful product right in the crosshairs of automated vehicle technology that's so prominent today. Progress in diagnostics and information with independent repair shop owners and managers was also clearly evident in our diagnostics business and our RS&I activity. And in this quarter, the launch of the new Triton d 10 hand belt helped both of that positive. The new TRITON is ultra fast, a two second boot up and it has a best in class 10 inch touchscreen. It's geared to the more capable technician offering a one touch full diagnostic code scan, scope capabilities for performance display, and guided testing of suspect components that you may want to replace. But you want to make sure that there's a problem. It's loaded with our Fast-Track Intelligent Diagnostics rooted in our proprietary database of over 200 billion vehicle events a Snap-on only feature that enables quick and accurate diagnosis of even the most difficult and unusual repairs, ensuring an efficient and effective solution for those very, very time-consuming problems. Just what the capable and senior technician needs. Now, as I've said before, we've spent considerable effort working to help franchisees sell the complex tools of today efficiently and it's paying off with TTITON. Each of our franchisees received a demonstration unit, facilitating the hands-on training guided by the video presentations that were a prominent part of our networks February sales meetings. Following that initial instructions, a demo unit could then be put immediately in the hands of a technician to physically showcase the great benefits of our powerful new tool and it worked. The launch has been a success. Our franchisees are comfortable selling new and complex tool and many are now calling the TRITON-D10 the best diagnostic unit ever. Finally, RS&I got a nice boost in the quarter. As often is the case by the new tech - by new technologies and OEM dealerships helped by some significant essential tools and equipment programs supporting the new electric vehicle launches. We're quite positive about RS&I's future repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves. It plays to our strength. So that's the highlights of the quarter, continued and strong progress. Our third straight period exceeding pre-pandemic levels, C&I, sequential improvement, sequential advancement, RS&I solid, the tools group strong and prompt, organic sales rising 16.3%, OpCo operating margin 19.6%, EPS $3.50 a big rise and most important. Most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than when we entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results is summarized on Slide 6. The first quarter of 2021 exhibited robust financial performance, particularly as compared to last year when we experienced initial shock of the virus. The quarter's results also compared favorably with the first quarter of 2019, which being a pre-pandemic time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1.246 billion in the quarter increased 20.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 16.3% organic sales again, $11.3 million of acquisition related sales and $19.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 11.2% from $921.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, including an 8.1% organic gain, $15.3 million of acquisition related sales and $11.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation Consolidated gross margin of 50.1% compared to 49.5% last year, which included 60 basis points from restructuring costs. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes of benefit from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.5% improved 270 basis points from 33.2% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs. The improvements primarily reflect the impact of higher sales and cost containment actions, partially offset by higher stock-based cost and 30 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Operating earnings before financial services of $200.9 million, compared to $138.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 44.6% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.6% improved 330 basis points from 16.3% last year, which included 90 basis points for restructuring costs. Financial services revenues of $88.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $85.9 million last year, while operating earnings of $65.3 million increased $8.4 million from 2020 levels, principally due to the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Last year's provisions included a $2.6 million charge for higher reserves resulting from the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. Consolidated operating earnings of $266.2 million increased 36% from $195.8 billion last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 23.9% compared to 20.9% in 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring costs. Excluding the restructuring costs operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 220 basis points from last year. Our first quarter effective income tax rate is 23.5% compared to 24.2% last year, which included a 10 basis point increase related to the prior year quarter's restructuring charges. Finally, net earnings of $192.6 million or $3.50 per diluted share increased $55.4 million, or $1.01 per share from 2020 levels representing a 40.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Additionally, net earnings increased $14.7 million or $0.34 per share from 2019 levels representing a 10.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Net earnings in 2020 included restructuring charges of $6 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share and net earnings in 2019 included a benefit of $8.7 million after tax or $0.15 per diluted share from a legal settlement. Excluding these items, diluted earnings per share of 350 in 2021, increased 34.6% from 2020 and 16.3% from 2019 levels. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7, sales of $345.7 million increase 15.3% from $299.9 million last year, reflecting a 9.5% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition related sales and $9.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes double digit increases in the segment's European based hand tools business and the Asia Pacific operations, as well as a mid single digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries. Improvements in year-over-year sales growth were widely seen across Europe as well as in most emerging markets. Additionally, within critical industries, strong sales gains were achieved in aviation, heavy duty and technical education. While year-over-year declines in the natural resources sector improved from those experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020, but continue to lag pre-pandemic sales levels. As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 7.2% from 2019 levels, representing a 3.1% organic sales gain, $8 million of acquisition related sales and $5.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross Margin of 38.7% improved 190 basis points from 36.8% in the first quarter of 2020, which included 150 basis points from restructuring charges. Aside from the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring cost, contributions from higher sales volumes were partially offset by 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24% improved 230 basis points as compared to last year, primarily as a result of the higher volumes and savings from cost containment actions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.7 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $31.5 million last year, the operating margin of 14.7% compared to 10.5% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8, sales in the Snap-on tools group of $478.3 million, increased 27.2% from $375.9 million in 2020 reflecting a 25% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increased reflects double digit gains in both our US and international operations. Net sales in the period increased 16.6% from $410.2 million in the first quarter of 2019, reflecting a 15.1% organic sales gain, and $5.2 million a favorable foreign currency translation. Gross Margin of 45.9% in the quarter improved 320 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.2%, improved from 29.8% last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and savings from cost containment action. Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $98.9 million, compared to $48.6 million last year. The operating margin of 20.7% compared to 12.9% a year ago an increase of 780 basis points. Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $347.6 million compared to $314.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 7.6% organic sales gain, $4 million of acquisition related sales and $4.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes the double-digit gain and sales of undercar equipment, mid single digit increases in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and a low single digit gain and activity with OEM dealerships. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased 6% reflecting a 3.1% organic sales gain, $7.3 million of acquisition related sales and $2.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross Margin of 46% declined from 47.9% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 70 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. As a reminder undercar equipment as well as facilitation program related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segments average. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales 22.6% improved 70 basis points from 23.3% last year, which included 80 basis points of restructuring costs. Excluding the effects of restructuring benefits from the higher sales volumes were more than offset by 80 basis points of operating expenses related to acquisitions. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $81.4 million compared to $77.3 million last year. The operating margin of 23.4% compared to 24.6% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from financial services of $88.6 million, compared to $85.9 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $65.3 million, compared to $56.9 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $23.3 million decreased to $5.7 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, resulting from $2.4 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge offs and the absence of the previously mentioned first quarter 2020 $2.6 million charge. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% and 1.4% in the first quarters of 2021 and 2020 respectively. In the first quarter the average yield on finance receivables of 17.6% in 2021, compared to 17.7% in 2020. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.4% and 9.0%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2021 includes the impact of lower interest business operations support loans for our franchisees. These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations and dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the first quarter, approximately $11 million of these business operating support loans remained outstanding. Total loan originations of $261.8 million in the first quarter increased $6.2 million or 2.4% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 1.7% increase in originations and finance receivables. While originations of contract receivables were up 5.7%. Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our US operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio decreased $25.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to an increase in net collections. The 60 day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for the United States extended credit is down 10 basis points from the first quarter last year and down 20 basis points as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. We believe this reflects the typical seasonal delinquency pattern that customarily results in a decline in the first quarter, followed by increases later in the year, usually peaking in the fourth quarter, where we compete with the technicians' holiday related discretionary spending. As it relates to extending credit, or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.9 million represented 2.55% of outstandings at quarter end, down seven basis points sequentially, and down 44 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $319.3 million in the quarter increased $105.9 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings and net changes in operating assets and liabilities including a $32.1 million decrease in inventory. Net cash used by investing activities of $207.2 million included $200 million for the acquisition of Dealer-FX and capital expenditures of $19.3 million partially offset by net collections of finance receivables of $12.1 million. Free cash flow during the quarter of $312.1 million was 158% in relation to net earnings. Net cash used by financing activities of $131 million, included cash dividends of 66.7 million and the repurchase of 722,000 shares of common stock for $151.9 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plans of $93 million. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $268.7 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $10.1 million from 2020 year end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 64 days a 2020 year end. Inventories decreased $16.4 million from 2020 year end and on a trailing 12 month basis inventory turned to 2.6 compared to 2.4 at year end 2020. Our quarter end cash position of $904.6 million, compared to $923.4 million at year end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 12.4% compared to 12.1% at year end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million of available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few of the guidance for 2021. We anticipate the capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate that absence of any changes at the US tax legislation, our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks Aldo. Well, that's our first quarter, another encouraging period, resilient markets through the shock and on the way to psychological recovery, the third straight quarter of upward trajectory, clear year-over-year achievement, and the third straight quarter of results exceeding the pre-pandemic levels of 2019. RS&I sales continuing upward with a wide margins of 23.4% attenuated, but still strong. CNI, ongoing sequential growth across the world. And OI margins 14.7% up nicely, even from 2019. And then the tools group, sales up organically 25% versus 2020 up in all product lines and in all geographies, volume up 15.1% versus 2019 and an OI margin of 20.7%. Finally, financial services in the midst of the greatest stress test profits up delinquencies down, rock solid, and they all came together with Snap-on sales rising organically 16.3% versus 2020 and 8.1% versus '19. OI margin 19.6% up significantly despite the virus, the unfavorable currency and the acquisition impacts and the EPS $3.50 a substantial rise versus both 2020 and 2019. We do believe that Snap-on has abundant opportunity as the COVID recedes and the world shifts away from the cities and away from shared transportation and as new vehicle technologies make the car park more complex. And we further believe that we are stronger today than when we entered the storm. Our advantages of product, brand and people are even greater. And we're in a favorable position to wield those strengths, realize the opportunities and continue our positive trajectory throughout 2021 and beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Many are listening. I want you to know that your work in this weathering has made a difference to our company and to our society. For your efforts in keeping our world and its critical mobility intact, you have my admiration. For your contribution to our progress in this first quarter, you have my congratulations. And for your unfailing dedication to our team in both smooth and turbulent times, you have my thanks. Now we'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead, sir. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning, everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning Gary, Gary Prestopino : Couple of questions here Nick, we haven't really seen this kind of growth in the tools group since probably earlier part of last decade, a lot of that was dealing with tool storage. And I don't think it's the same issues now. I mean, if you could cite three or four things that are different in the growth metrics now what you're seeing, especially over the last couple of quarters versus what you saw, maybe when tool storage was really rubbing up on an earlier period last decade. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, I think there's a couple of things, I think one, this isn't a tool storage and that it was a much more focused growth. We introduced the - certainly the first thing is when we had that rise, we introduced the Rock N' Roll Cabs and the Techno's, which really focused on more or less a particular product line. This was a - this is a broader thing, much more rooted in kind of agnostic process from a product point of view of expanding the capabilities of the tools - of the franchisees. We harness social media better, we're training them better to get the elevator pitch down, and we RCI their vans, or we worked on this for quarters before maybe even in 2019. And we worked really hard in the COVID, because we had time to focus on it. And that's really paying off. It's showing that these franchisees can hit this 20%. The other thing is, I think we got some good products, particularly around hand tools. We package the hand tools, so we're selling not only individual tools, but also kits aimed at a particular problem, and they're becoming pretty profitable, popular. We didn't talk about them on the call. I mean things like putting together a set of sockets that are for particular applications in foam. They're wildly popular. And then the other products we have in terms of tool storage and diagnostics. They're really baffled and that's driving that that broad appeal. And then the final thing, I think you could think, look, there's a lot of this condition, you could - people might say this is recovery, but the sales off the van over last year exceeded the sales to the van, so you wouldn't think there'd be recovery in that. Not so much recovery in that situation. It's going off the van at the same level. The whole year was up. And same things happening this quarter, sales up the van is the same as we're selling to them. So you look at this, you might say it's a stimulus and the stimulus could be helping us this way. We don't know, when you're talking to technicians and people in a practice stimulus seems to be always going into bank accounts or paying off debt. And the other thing about it is, by the way, we think it's product and process based because the international business, UK, Australia and Canada are up and a regional stimulus is there. Gary Prestopino : Right, okay, that's good. And then in terms of I guess, it's Dealer-FX, a couple of questions on this one. What can you tell us in terms of their installed base across dealerships versus the amount of dealerships that you actually service? Can you give us some idea of just how much whitespace there is out there for this product? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, they tend to be - they're in I would say maybe in the double digit percentage of the dealerships, but they tend to be concentrated in a couple of OEMs. And so there's a lot of whitespace to grow in that situation. We see that tremendous opportunity. And the other thing about Dealer-FX, I think we talked about this in the acquisition, they're just now sort of rolling out this new - their updated system that was ready to go, but the COVID hit. So now they get the chance sight at the apple with full force. But again, these are things we knew when we acquired them. It's early days, we've only owned them for a couple months. So we're still getting on, but we're pretty confident we're in the right place at the right time like I said in my comments. Gary Prestopino : Are they going to be - are their revenues booked in the RS&I segment? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, they're going to be in RS&I. Gary Prestopino : In RS&I? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, because they're going to sell to dealers, we see them as sort of like the advanced warning net for us from a strategic point of view. You remember the old do line, I used to be across Canada, to make sure we figured out what the Russia bombers were doing when they're coming over the goal - over the North. So this is the same kind of thing. Gary Prestopino : Okay and then you also just mentioned some new tools for the EV market. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? Nick Pinchuk : Well, those things are particular to a particular vehicle. We have a business. We call the EQS business that really is rooted in new technology. When new technologies roll out, or one of the people, the OEMs come to, to say, hey, put together a set of tools. Now in one of these, we have a 70 unit toolset that we provide that supports a certain new vehicle that's coming out. So I mean, that's, that's one of the things and so - and yet there's another one for another new vehicle. So as people roll out new vehicles, they commission these kinds of things to facilitate the dealerships to be ready to deal with it. And then everybody figures out what other things might happen and that shows up and we launched other tools to match that that the OEMs didn't even anticipate going forward. Those are the kinds of things. And we have a set of tools. We have a standard set of tools for electrics that are what we call insulating tools with glass infused nylon that allows us to - technician to use them safely against - and be approved against some pretty high voltages and so that's sockets and pliers and screwdrivers and kits to disconnect the electric vehicle safely and that kind of thing. Gary Prestopino : Okay and just lastly real quick, I don't want to take up too much more time. I would assume some of these calibration tools for ADAS and things that you've got out there, these are also applicable to the EV market? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Sure. They're rooted - they're pretty much agnostic to the power train. They're more or less having to do with the sensors - the neural net of the sensors around the vehicle. Gary Prestopino : Thank you so much. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, sir. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on the - Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Christopher Glynn : So picking up on your answer to one of Gary's questions you talked about coming out with new kits and follow-on tools as new platforms come out in EV and elsewhere. So it underscores your visibility. And then with the Dealer-FX group, you talked about how that extends your visibility. I'm just curious how that pairs with your already seeming copious visibility into the new platforms? Nick Pinchuk : Well, the thing is that we have visibility into the new platforms. We are franchisees, which visit the dealers every day. So they tend to have a look at the, what I would call the more persnickety problems that arise all the time associated with vehicles that no one ever anticipated. The Dealer-FX is the repair shop management software. So you get to see what's happening in an aggregate kind of like databases to look at this kind of thing and say, okay, well, they're having a lot of problems here, they're having a lot of problems there. And you get to understand the difficulties associated with that. So it's not so much an observational thing it's a computational thing. Those are the kinds of things that help. So it just adds to our position. And then we also have a non-peril position in the repair shops afterwards, after vehicles age, and they end up in independent repair shops, which is what you're referring to. We're in more shops for more hours in days. And that's what drives our product line. So when new technologies show in whether you're talking about automated vehicles or electric vehicles, they're going to roll through this, we're going to see them via Deale-FX probably first, then we're going to see them via the franchisees that call on dealerships to understand the nuances of some smaller and more difficult problems that are harder to predict via just maybe the bigger problems, the 20,000 foot problems that the software might see. And then as they roll into the aftermarket, we have probably almost proprietary visibility on that. That's what generates our proprietary databases that I talked about 200 billion repair records. Christopher Glynn : Great and then on SOT, you talked a lot about the kind of throughput enhancements. Do these sales levels that you've seen the past few quarters represent pretty maximized realization of the newly availed bandwidth of the franchise channel into the addressable market? Nick Pinchuk : Well, that I don't know. You know what I mean? I don't know that. All I know, is they can go that high. You know what I mean? We now approved, it's sort of like a stress test. We know they can go that high. And they're not complaining. I had a franchisee telling me, I asked him about something about his market. I asked him about what is the market like and so on? He says, I don't know, I'm too busy selling tools. So he's out there now. He didn't say he didn't have more capacity, because he was asking me for more units. So in other words, he was short of a particular product line. So he thought he could sell them more. So we think they probably have a little more upside. But in this kind of situation, Chris, you'd have to keep pounding. We'd say okay, we got to keep working on expanding the capabilities because no matter where they are, you want more when you go forward, right. Christopher Glynn : Right, so you feel you have further runway to continue to work on the throughput side of the equation? Nick Pinchuk : Sure. What happens is - just one question. What happens is you observe what's happening at a certain throughput level and that reveals the pinch points and you work on that. Christopher Glynn : Great last one for me, finance receivable collections just exceeded additions. I don't recall many years seeing that - are you seeing more customers paying with cash? Aldo Pagliari : Well, Chris, I think what you see is the technician base, they're employed. They got more money in their pocket, and they seem to be servicing their debt and buying tools to supplement their needs. So I guess it's just an overview I think provided earlier, people are servicing the debt in a more pragmatic way. Christopher Glynn : Sounds great, thanks, guys. Aldo Pagliari : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead. Luke Junk : Good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Luke Junk : Couple of questions, first a new term question, Nick, hoping you could just talk qualitatively about daily sales trends through the quarter, certainly? Looking at the 2019 comps for the tools group, especially help to frame the absolute level to be really well, but I just want to better understand the sequential momentum you saw in the first quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, look, I think one of the things we're seeing is our third quarter - third month was higher in this period, but they're, they're almost always higher a little bit, if you look at this. So I would say, we would have said that adjusted for what we expect. The sales were about level through the quarter kind of constant. Generally we have our own sort of like, view of what's going to happen when you roll out of the beginning in first quarter for example, and so we have some view, but this generally seemed about we expected. We weren't surprised by any month in this quarter, I would say. So I think - we think it's kind of held strong each quarter. I don't see attenuation, if that's what you're asking. Luke Junk : It is, thanks for that. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, Nick. I don't - we didn't see any attenuation. Luke Junk : Okay and then a bigger picture question more on the strategy side. And it has come up already a couple of times this morning in terms of the big shifts that we've seen in the new car market the past, say six or nine months with respect to electrification, especially ADAS as well. And all these changes take a while, of course, to ultimately filter through to the aftermarket. Hoping you could just expand on how these changes are impacting your thinking around investment priorities today, both organically and M&A? And should we think that, for instance, they impacted the thinking around the Dealer-FX acquisition, for example? Nick Pinchuk : Well, yes. I mean, the thing is sure. Look, we like change. Like we said, I think we've said the house come home, that changes our friend and we love to have it. And the earlier we can see change, the more we can, as you say, call in the air strikes about investment and so on. And so the Dealer-FX acquisition was about positioning ourselves at the forefront at the vanguard, if you will, of new technologies, not just electric vehicles, but new technologies that would impinge on the car park. So that's what we're doing. And so we'll continue to look at that in terms of, okay, what do we learn from that, how can we invest in other places to follow that change. But make no mistake about it. The revelations occur in each aging of the vehicle, so things change as you roll out. When the vehicle rolls in, people think this is what's needed. And then a couple of years go by and we see that these are what's needed. And some of it isn't even - this is what I was trying to say before is some of it isn't the fact that you have to repair, let's say, a particular item or you have to recalibrate the sensors. It might be revealed to us in the difficulty of doing those products - those processes, which everybody - first, you understand you got to do it and then you realize, wait a minute. On these particular vehicles, you need special tools just to do them because they're configured in an odd way. This is - and we learned that as it went through. And so basically, we see ourselves this electric vehicle, the EV, the new technologies. It's just the version of what's happened before, only maybe hopefully at a faster pace, which gives us more to sell. And so our activities will be to try to anticipate those changes more quickly, invest in them and then enjoy. Luke Junk : Good. I'll leave it there. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Scott Stember with C.L. King. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys, and congrats on the strong results in the quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. Scott Stember : I think you - Aldo, you might have answered this question, but the growth in originations versus the tools organic sales. Obviously, there's a pretty big delta there. Is that entirely because more you're seeing more mechanics basically buy with cash, or is there something else - some other nuance that we just need to know about? Aldo Pagliari : A couple of things, I think there's a little bit. I think there's more cash in the system. So that's probably - if anything, that's probably not negative, it's probably a positive. I think that, again, you're still at stages where your psychological recovery is not completely the same everywhere in the country. So I think people, broadly speaking, It's still a little bit more measured when they approach big ticket items as compared to hand tools, power tools, things of that nature. I still think there's that nuance. But when the tools group sells 25% organically, without having to dig deep into extend the credit, we feel that means there's borrowing capacity down the road that opens up future opportunities for them. So we kind of like the mix in that respect. Scott Stember : Got it and in RS&I, the - on the car care, I mean, that was the first time we've seen a major increase like that in a while. So I'm wondering, is that being driven by stronger collision market demand? And if so, what are you hearing about miles driven? Because obviously, collision repair is based - a lot of it is based on the miles driven of the car. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Look, I think - actually, it's not really - collision repair was better in the United States, not so good in Europe. I would say the big feature there for us was the undercar equipment, aligners in particular, but this ADAS stuff, stuff that really focuses on the neural network of the business. That's what drove that change. You're right. It was a really welcome change, double digits for the equipment. That was a turn of events that we really love. We haven't talked about a thing like that associated with equipment in a while. So that's part of the overhang that because it's a lower-margin business, that's part of the mix overhang on RS&I. But that turn, I think, based on the change in vehicle complexity now driven by the autonomy, these autonomous features, and therefore, undercar equipment was important. We're starting to see some recovery in collision in the US. Like I said, Europe seems to be dead as a door nail. The miles driven, we're seeing it start to come back. The curve looks just like other years. It's just came back from the shock of the virus. So it went down 30% year-over-year in the shock. And now it's according to BLS data - according to the data we see, it's staying around 10% below pre-COVID levels that it's inching back. I would expect, though, that as people - and that's not surprising every time you look you turn on TV, you see people feeding in from home. Once people go back, I think this all changes. Scott Stember : Got it and just last question on flushing out the tools group, you said it was pretty much everything was up, but it sounds like hand tools and diagnostics probably led the way, if I heard correctly? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Yes. Not pretty much, everything was up, but hand tools led the way. Diagnostics was strong. Power tools was nice as well. So smaller ticket items were - are ascended in this period. You can see our RI business, how the kind of sets because the guys are a little more - like I use the word, there's still an air of vigilance. They're positive. But they're a little more vigilant in this situation. So even the tool storage, they tend to be focused on the smaller purchases in the tool storage area. So that thing. But I would say that each of the - each of them, each product line had a pretty good quarter, maybe not up to the 25%, we're pretty satisfied with all the product lines, but the top one was hand tools. Scott Stember : Got it. That's all I have. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir. Nick Pinchuk : Curt? Curtis Nagle : Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks very much. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Curtis Nagle : Good, how are you? Yeah, so Just a quick one on inflation, so I know you said this plenty of times that steel is only I don't know 85, 90 mil of COGS, but prices are up a good bit, pretty persistently. So anything in terms of potential price increases or rising costs relating to inputs that you would elaborate on? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Look - yes, well, look, we've got material inflation in these numbers. We can't see them, can you, right. And so part of the thing is you got - you kind of got an interesting cocktail of reduced travel, controlled costs, material inflation floating through this. And the general managers in our businesses are balancing all these, like balls in the air. And so yeah, we might see some, but we're not - at the same time, we can also price. And I think the tools group has got another price increase going out. They just announced in April - early April, they announced the price increase, so they're going to have one coming up. And so we think we're the price leader and we can price for visible inflation, so you have that in the play too. So we might see some going forward where we think it's under control. I mean, this is - I think I said in another forum that this is kind of what they pay us for to manage this stuff. Curtis Nagle : Okay, fair enough. And then if I wasn't mistaken, did I hear that the education segment was up in 1Q? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Curtis Nagle : So that sounds like a change. Yeah, what happened there? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look, I think - yeah. I think everybody is anticipating the schools. I think there are some schools back. And then - but I would say the big factor, Curt is that the schools are starting to anticipate the return of the students. So they're starting to facilitate. So the education business is up principally because you're selling to the schools. And so we have a two-pronged view there. We sell to the students and the schools and we see a lot of students starting to warm up. And I think - I also think in this day and age, just starting to see, if I were sitting in a community college and I'd see the Biden administration rolling in there, and I don't think it's a political statement to reveal that he has a particular bent, given his wife's orientation and then things he said to community college technical training. And so I think that might be a positive view and created an area of optimism in the school. So I think that changed the dynamic some. It was - we're pretty pleased to see it. And in fact, again the critical industry businesses got back above the pre-COVID levels. I think that - I don't want people to miss that. We're above pre-COVID levels. And by the way, we're bearing the COVID at the same time. So I think that - and that's where C&I was. They've been going each quarter. They've been getting a little closer to 2019. This time they flipped above it. We view that as an incredibly positive event. Curtis Nagle : Got it, makes sense. All right, guys thanks very much. Good luck for the second quarter. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dave MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Dave MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone and good morning, Nick. Congratulations - yeah, congratulations on the strong results. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks. Dave MacGregor : I guess first question, I'm still really struggling on this disparity between originations and the sell-through. You had indicated the sell-through was equivalent with the sell-in. So let's call it the sell-through up 25%, originations up 2.4%, which is one of the - Nick Pinchuk : Well, wait a minute. Wait, hold it just a minute. The sell-through is equal absolute. It was a little bit better in the first quarter of last year. So when you're comparing those things, you start to get bollocks stuff a little bit. Last year wasn't as bad sell-through as it - as sell to the vans was in the first quarter. So we - but generally to come back and say - so I just want to stop you there. But in general, if you're talking about volume, the volume off the van is same as the volume on the van this quarter. Understand what I said? Dave MacGregor : Yeah. I want to - what should we be using then as a sell-through number for this quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Well, it's roughly the same. Dave MacGregor : Same as the sell-in? Nick Pinchuk : Right. Dave MacGregor : Okay. It's a large disparity nonetheless, however you want to cut it. And I guess I'm really struggling with just kind of the nature of that given you also indicated that all the segments are up. And I guess the question just becomes given that originations generally revolve around extended credits and contract credits obviously as well, but it's bigger ticket. So I guess the question is just can you break out a big ticket for us and help us just understand what big ticket was on a year-over-year basis? Nick Pinchuk : Well, here's what I'll tell you, is that the big-ticket items weren't up in - it weren't up like the 25%, but they were up nicely in the quarter. So they were up - Dave MacGregor : Is it double digits? Nick Pinchuk : No. They weren't up double digits in the quarter, but they were up. Again, when you look at the absolute numbers, they were reasonable in that situation. So we're pleased with those numbers. So you had that. And then within the big-ticket items, let's put diagnostics side, if you look at tool storage, the tool storage mix has been for a while, closer to the, let's say, carts and other things, and there's a lot more RA going on. So the franchisees are flushed with cash. So you're seeing some of those franchisees finance these items. That's really the factor. Now you could argue that - you could also argue, Dave, that we're - I think that's really what's going on. You could also see it's hard to tell this. You could see we're getting stimulus need to pay for some of those things instead of borrowing. But we kind of view that as great because as Aldo said you just got borrowing capacity out there in the future. So this is a really good thing for us. We love it when RA is up. Dave MacGregor : Okay. Well, maybe I'll take that offline with Aldo and try and get through the math a little bit better. I wanted to ask you about - you'd indicated about just volumes on the quarter because you indicated that you'd announced in April a price increase, which I think is May 1. You've got kind of - you communicated to the franchisees that you're experiencing growing backlogs. I don't know if that's around tool steel or what may be responsible for that. But under those circumstances, my understanding is there's some pre-buy going on in the month of March. And I'm just wondering if you can quantify for us the extent to which you can just combine - Nick Pinchuk : I think you are missing thoughts about that. Dave MacGregor : I'm sorry? Nick Pinchuk : I don't think that - we don't think that's true. First of all, the announcement goes out in April. So I don't think people are pre-buying. The people may be buying. Generally, what happens in these kinds of things are buying off the kickoff programs or the - even back to the kickoff program. So they're fundamentally buying off that. I'm talking to a bunch of franchisees so they keep telling me their inventories are low on this stuff. They can - they'd like to get more, but they don't get them. They don't have it. So I think this is - the idea of the pre-buy, we didn't see any of that. Now I'm not saying franchisees are what, 3,500 of them. So you can get windshield surveys on them and you can get different ones will have different views. I can probably get a hundred different opinions when I go out. But generally, we don't see that, Dave. We see the situation - they're not stock. In fact, we think we're confident that franchisees' inventories are actually down or flat at best. They're not up. Dave MacGregor : Really? So - Nick Pinchuk : And if you look back to the first quarter of last year, sales off the van exceeded sales to the van. Dave MacGregor : Yeah. I find that a little surprising given everybody in the franchise world knows that there's stimulus money coming down the pipe and they want to be positioned for that. And then my understanding is you communicated to the franchisees that there was a backlog issue in March, and I would have presumed that guys would pre-buy on that. So I'm always surprised to hear that inventories on the truck are flat to slightly down, a little bit counterintuitive, I guess. And then last question for me is just on price elasticity - Nick Pinchuk : I don't necessarily see it that way. But anyway, necessarily, they could order, but they might not have them. Dave MacGregor : Yeah, okay. Nick Pinchuk : Right. Dave MacGregor : Can you just talk about - Nick Pinchuk : So we wouldn't have a sale. What? Dave MacGregor : Right. Okay. And then price elasticity around storage. I guess, it's - these are some pretty big increases we're seeing in steel prices right now. And as a consequence, I would expect some pretty big increases on price tags on some of the storage product at least and maybe in hand tools given what's going on with nickel alloy product. But can you just talk about how you expect that to play out over the balance of the year as you raise your prices? How vulnerable do you think that category is to higher prices given - Nick Pinchuk : You know what, Dave? Sure. Look, I think it gets to be a complex question, David, because almost everything is - there's a lot of promotions floating through the system. So it's not just the list price increases. It's also what are your promotions and so on. So we've never had a problem, tool storage or otherwise in terms of getting or matching inflation. We've never seen that. So I can only tell you what is in history. And it's a complex cocktail. You raise the list price. You adjust your promotions. You have long-term promotions, you have drop in promotions. It's a dizzying array of those things. And what comes out the other end is a matching of the inflation. So generally, you feel we can do that on a macro basis. And you can't do that unless you do it until storage and hand tools. Dave MacGregor : Great. I'm more focused around the mechanics capacity to purchase and their purchasing power and these products just maybe finding themselves a little bit of reach. You're not concerned about that right now? You're not getting an indication that - Nick Pinchuk : All right. We don't see that being a problem right now and there was inflation in this period. So I mean the thing is we don't see that being a problem now. Of course, you can't say it'd go on forever. But I think the - look, I think the whole thing is this. The mechanics seem to love to buy tools. It's one of the top things on their priorities. I think that these kinds of changes don't necessarily make a difference. Now who's to say how the inflation would play out across the country in a lot of different commodities, but I think - I would tell you this, I think we would be going to be one of the last to be affected by it. Dave MacGregor : Great, if I could, just for the model, two quick ones. What was the U.S. versus international in terms of growth and - Nick Pinchuk : About the same, it's about the same. Dave MacGregor : And, secondly, what percentage of trucks now are to associates and how has that changed year over year? Nick Pinchuk : It's about the same. It's up a little bit. It's in the 20% to 25% range. Dave MacGregor : Okay. Thanks very much, gentlemen. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Verbsky, at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : And this concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'm going to start the call by covering the highlights of our second quarter and along the way I'll give you my perspective on our results. Once again they were encouraging and our markets, robust and promising and our continued progress and strength amidst the pandemic. The pandemic isn\u2019t over, but we believe we're stronger right now than when it all started. Of course, we\u2019ll also speak about what it all means, then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. We believe that our second quarter again demonstrates Snap-on\u2019s ability to continue with the trajectory of positive results, overcoming a variety of ongoing headwinds, accommodating to the lingering virus environment, meeting the challenges of the day across the business world and advancing along our runaways for growth and for improvement.  Our reported sales on the quarter were 1,081.4 million and they were up versus last year, $357.1 million or 49.3%, including $20.6 million of favorable foreign currency change and $19.6 million in acquisition related sales. The organic sales were up 42.5% with significant gains in every group; our fourth straight quarter being above pre-pandemic levels, a V-shaped trajectory that defines resilience and flexible capability.  The OpCo operating income of $217.1 million was up $126 million from last year, which included $4 million of restructuring charge. OpCo operating margin was 20.1%, up from the 2020 level of 12.6% or 13.1% as adjusted for restructuring, representing a 700 basis point as adjusted improvement. The financial services operating income of $68.9 million increased 19.6%, higher originations, lower losses, delinquencies, below pre-pandemic levels, our finance company passing the greatest stress test of our time with flying colors, and that result combined with OpCo for a consolidated operating margin of 24.5% up 560 basis points as adjusted.  Quarterly EPS was $3.76 up a 103.2% from last year, and excluding the 2020 restructuring charges EPS grew 96.9% versus the pre-pandemic levels of 2019 the EPS grew 16.8%, clearly tracing an ongoing positive trend. I've said it before, but it bears repeating, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great weathering, and we believe our second quarter is emphatic evidence of that fact.  Compared with 2019 our sales in the past quarter grew $130.1 million or 13.7%. That reflects $23 million of acquisition related sales, $17.2 million of favorable foreign currency and $89.9 million or 9.3% organic game. The 2021 OpCo operating margin of 20.1% was up 10 basis points from 2019, but that gain was achieved against 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and acquisition impacts, all while absorbing the lingering effects of the virus, it's not gone. So, those are the numbers.  From a macro market perspective, it's clear that our automotive repair sector remains favorable. The technicians across the map are still at their posts, repairing cars and trucks, keeping the world running and they are busy, and as expected after the COVID, it appears that people are leaning more towards personal transportation and are holding onto their vehicles longer every year. Auto repair is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it from our franchisees and you can see it in our numbers.  As we look forward we see greater opportunities as vehicle techs encountered even more complex repairs, new technologies, alternative powertrains, greater proliferation of driver assistance electronics, it\u2019s all music to our ears. And then there is the repair shop owners and managers, RS&I territory, a little more mixed, particularly in Europe, but a return to growth in repair, garages and dealerships. They are starting to invest. Undercar equipment and OEM programs are coming back and RS&I is taking advantage of that trend with new equipment offerings and advanced database solution continually improving our software products and our diagnostic releases. Products like Mitchell 1 Repair Information Software and Shop Management Software and Electronic Parts Catalogues and our Dealer-FX shop management technology, and our heavy duty and our intelligent diagnostic units, big data basis and getting more powerful, and easier to use, helping the shop fix it right the first time efficiently. Repair shop is changing, rising in complexity and RS&I has the products to match.  Finally, let's talk about critical industries where the Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving past the consequence. This is where the C&I operates, our most international operations where the customers have endured the longest impact of the virus and have been slower to accommodate it or recovering it, what I call varied rates.  Segments like oil and gas and aviations in geographies like Southeast Asia and India still down. But despite the variation we did see growth in critical industries, improvements in education. The students are coming back and in power generation and heavy duty fleet, all combining to offset that continuing turbulence.  So overall I describe our C&I market as healthy and representing clear opportunity, and coupled with auto repair, we believe our markets are robust now and there\u2019s considerable opportunity ahead, and we have opportunity ahead for us as we move along our runways for growth and improvement, and I can't leave [ph] this section, about robust progress and abundant possibilities without speaking on the engine of our advance Snap-on value creation. Customer connection and innovation, developing new products and solutions, born out of insights and observations, gathered right in the workplaces and RCI, guiding the expansion of franchisees selling capacity with better processes, more effective training and a new focus on social media, it will all help drive our progress, overcoming the \u2013 accommodating the virus and enabling us to take full advantage of the opportunities and chart a continuing and positive trend forward; that's the overview.  Now let\u2019s move to the segments. In the C&I group, sales in the quarter were up 33.8% or $88.6 million versus 2020, including a $71.3 million or 26.3% organic uplift with double digit progress across all of the divisions. From an earnings perspective C&I operating income of $55.5 million including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency represents a rise of $32.6 million compared to 2020, which included a $2 million or restructuring.  That all means an as-adjusted increase of over 122.9% and the operating margin was 15.8%, an as reported increase of 710 basis points, a rise of 630 basis points as adjusted and an uplift of 120 basis points from the pre-pandemic level in 2019 despite 90 basis points of unfavorable currency. When compared with pre-pandemic 2019, sales were up 4.6%, including a 0.4% organic gain, above flat, now a continuing bright spot for C&I.  SNA Europe did deliver yet another quarter of growth expanding beyond pre-pandemic levels against the wind, with the sparkle of Ergo Tool Management System leading the way, tailoring products specific to customer needs. Europe is a varied market environment, but SNA in Europe is defining economic gravity again, and that positive was joined by contributions from recovering areas in critical industry like heavy duty, power generation and as I said before, education, whose come to the party just now. And from Asia Pacific geographies like China and Japan, and those gains were balanced by declines in attenuated sectors like the military, aerospace and natural resources, all still weak. We do remain confident in and committed to extending in critical industries and we're committed with great new products.  Speaking of product, in the last quarter it helped solve challenging tasks across aviation and other critical industries. We launched the new Snap-on 14.4 volt microlithium cordless right angle mini drill, with a 6000 RPM, making it ideal for drilling a variety of materials, plastics to aluminum to fiberglass. The unit has a compact 90 degree head, which provides easier access to confined spaces and reduces worker fatigue, it\u2019s a big factor. In addition, it also offers a higher quality chuck that achieves precise drilling with minimum run-out, ensuring tight tolerances are met with considerable reliability.  To top it all off, the drill also utilizes a double ball bearing supported spindle shaft and spiral bevel gears. I know that\u2019s a mouthful, but it all means that the new power tool has a clear superiority and durability. The cordless right angle midi is a great innovation with an array of advantages and the techs are noticing it. So that\u2019s C&I, a promising quarter, moving down it's runways for growth with strong profitability, C&I, OI margin 15.8%.  Now on to the tools group. Sales were $484.1 million up $160.8 million, including $154 million or 46.7% organic gain, double digit growth both in the U.S. and the international operations, and the operating margin was 21.4%, up 930 basis points. Compared with pre-virus 2019 sales grew $78.3 million, including $70.7 million or 17.1% organic gain and this quarter its 21.4% operating margin. It was up 380 basis points compared with the pre-virus numbers, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed, another power \u2013 I was going to say powerful, I guess I could say that, but another positive quarter with double digit expansion across all geographies and all products.  We do believe our van network remains quite strong. Just a few weeks ago I spent time with a dozen franchisees on our \u2013 dozen franchisees on our U.S. National Franchisee Advisory Council at our Algona, Iowa tool storage plant and they were pumped and prosperous, excited by their current position, positive about the other vans in the regions - in the regions they represent, and very optimistic about their prospects for even more, beyond the windshield surveys.  We see other indications of continuing strength, like the Business Health Metrics, they remain quite favorable, qualitative and quantitative indicators, both very positive, and that positivity was not just internal, it was reinforced by the external view. Snap-on was recognized again this year among the top 50 in the franchise industry by Entrepreneur Magazine and once again we scored highest in the tools distribution category, place we\u2019ve held for quite some time and now this type of recognition, this kind of positivity reflects the fundamental in contemporary strength of our franchisees and of our overall van business, and would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of unique new products.  Hand tools were up in the quarter and part of that, and part of that torque is rising in importance as more mechanical provisions, precision becomes necessary to support vehicle automation and we are riding that wave with great new products, like our new ATECH micro torque wrench with a quick release head. The quarter inch drive quick release has a positive locking mechanism to retain the socket solidly and securely in place, and at the same time it offers a push button for easy tool disengagement. It holds and it ejects, both important under the hood, at it\u2019s a time saver. It\u2019s quite a time saver in close clearance applications like valve cover removal and spark plug replacements that happen every day in the garage. The tool also offers visual and \u2013 visual, audible, and vibration alerts to confirm that the proper torque has been applied and it has a wide torque range, 12 to 240 pound inches, and the new micro also includes a 50 degree flex head ratchet for better access to fasteners, a 72 tooth quarter inch drive socket ratchet enabling efficient operation in tight areas and a plus or minus 2% accuracy. Our micro tech takes precision fastening to the next level.  Tool storage is also strong in the quarter and part of that success was our KTL 1023 A3 Roll Cab, a wide 72 inch Triple-Bank Tool storage box. It offers three extra wide drawers for longer and larger tools, giving the technician more organizational options. Our patented lock and roll latch mechanism which prevents draws from drifting opened and our ISO-Ride\u00ae Caster for riding a smooth ride, smooth rolling and excellent weight capacity, plus, plus it adds our LED lighted power top which spans the full width of the cabinet for better illumination and great eye appeal. It includes 10 offset AC outlets and 4 USB ports for charging a larger array of the tech select electronics. The KTL 1023 A3, storage efficiency in a box that captures sharp attention in any shop. Sales of the unit, well it\u2019s a sellout.  Our new products are in fact making a difference in the tools group. You can\u2019t miss it in the numbers. They also \u2013 and the group also registered its fourth straight quarter of above pre-pandemic levels, the tools group unmistakably is moving onward and upward.  Now on to the RS&I group. Sales were up 62.7% or $153.6 million versus last year, including $135.7 million or 54.1% organic uplift with double digit growth weighted toward our under car equipment and our OEM project businesses. But with our diagnostics and information product businesses still delivering strong double digit increases in addition to the waiting towards undercar equipment and OEM projects.  From an earnings perspective RS&I operating income of $86.7 million represents a rise of $36.1 million or 71.3% compared to 2020, which included $1.4 million of restructuring. And the operating margin was 21.8%, an increase of 110 basis points from last year, 60 basis points as adjusted but again to the 180 basis point impact of unfavorable currency and acquisition affects.  When compared with 2019, sales were up 14.2% as reported and organic growth was $29.7 million or 8.4% with double digit advances in undercar equipment, OEM projects, diagnostics and information in North America, all of that being attenuated by a general weakness in Europe. For profitability the OI margin was 21.8% -- the OI margin of 21.8% was down 360 basis points, with a 150 point impact from unfavorable currency and acquisition effects and with a further drag from the higher sales of undercar equipment in OEM projects, both at the lower end of RS&I margins.  Having said that, RS&I has great opportunities and we are fortifying its way forward with more new products. We just introduced our new ZEUS Mobile work centers, giving the technicians the ability to use the full capabilities of our top of the line diagnostics information systems, including our exclusive fast track intelligent diagnostics from anywhere on the service bay. It is a compact footprint for great mobility, reaching all over the shop. It also incorporates a lockable tool drawer, tool storage cabinets and a large 27 inch touch-screen display.  The new ZEUS workstation offers significant improvements in convenience, in security and in visibility, combined with the power of our most sophisticated databases. It's just the ticket for those shops that want to solve the most difficult repair challenges and want to visibly display their advance capability for all the customers to see as they come in the shop, and the new workstation is making a difference, attracting attention and it's setting new volume levels for this category.  So to wrap-up RS&I, improving position with repair shop owners and managers, strong growth across all the divisions, recovering areas of undercar equipment and OEM projects and expanding product lines to lead the way forward. Well, those are the highlights of the quarter, tools group, strong progress everywhere, unmistakable strength. C&I reporting a positive performance with significant profitability against variations across industry and geographies and RS&I expanding volume in independent repair shops and OEM dealerships, gains in the U.S. overcoming weakness in Europe.  Overall sales increasing for the corporation up nicely, both versus last year at 42.5% up and compared with pre-pandemic levels at 9.3% up, continuing our V-shaped recovery. OpCo operating margin, a strong 21% up again in the face of 70 basis points of unfavorable currency and acquisition effect. EPS, $3.76 in the quarter, up for the fourth quarter in a row, up versus last year, up versus last quarter, up versus pre-pandemic levels. It was another encouraging quarter.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo. Aldo Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. The second quarter of 2021 exhibited solid financial performance, particularly as compared to last year's heavily pandemic impacted second quarter. The results also compared favorably with the second quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period may serve to be the more meaningful baseline.  Net sales of $1,081.4 million in the quarter increased 49.3% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 42.5% organic sales gain, $19.6 million of acquisition related sales and $20.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Sequentially organic sales improved by 4.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 13.7% from $951.3 million in the second quarter of 2019, including a 9.3% organic gain, $23.0 million of acquisition-related sales, and $17.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 310 basis points from 47.1% last year, which included 30 basis points from restructuring costs. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.1% improved 440 basis points from 34.5% last year, which included 20 basis points from restructuring costs. The improvement primarily reflects the benefits of higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher stock based cost and 70 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings before financial services of $217.1 million compared to $91.1 million in 2020, reflecting 138.3% year-over-year improvement. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.1% improved 750 basis points from 12.6% last year, which included 50 basis points for restructuring costs.  Financial services revenue of $86.9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $84.6 million last year, while operating earnings of $68.9 million increased $11.3 million from 2020 levels, primarily as a result of higher revenue and lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $286 million increased 92.3% from $148.7 million last year.  As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.5% compared to 18.4% in 2020, which included 50 basis points from restructuring costs. Excluding the restructuring costs, operating earnings margin in 2021 increased 560 basis points from last year.  Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.3% compared to 24.1% last year, which included a 20 basis point increase related to the prior year quarter's restructuring charges. Net earnings of $208 million of $3.76 per diluted share increased to $106.8 million or $1.91 per share from last year's levels, representing a 103.2% increase in diluted earnings per share.  As compared to 2020, excluding the restructuring charges of $3.3 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share, diluted earnings per share increased 96.9%. Relative to the second quarter of 2019, net earnings increased $27.6 million or $0.54 per share, representing a 16.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on slide seven, sales of $350.5 million increased 33.8% from $261.9 million last year, reflecting a 26.3% organic sales gain, $7.7 million of acquisition related sales and $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  The organic gain reflects higher activity in all of the segments operations and includes mid-teen increases in sales to customers in critical industries. Within critical industries, robust sales gains were achieved in general industry, heavy duty and technical education, but were partially offset by year-over-year declines in sales to the military, which had remained strong in the pandemic impacted period last year.  As a further comparisons, net sales in the period increased 4.6% from 2019 levels, reflecting $1.4 million of organic sales gains, $7.7 million of acquisition related sales and $6.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. As compared to 2019, sales in our European based hand tools business were up high single digits. With respect to critical industry sales activity in that period, our military, international aerospace and natural resources segments were below 2019 levels. All other critical industry segments are at or about the second quarter of 2019.  Gross margin of 39.5% improved 510 basis points from 34.4% in the second quarter of 2020, which included 80 basis points from restructuring charges. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and the improvements resulting from the lower restructuring costs were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.7% improved 200 basis points compared to last year, primarily as a result of the improved volumes. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.5 million including $1.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $22.9 million last year. The operating margin of 15.8% compared to 8.7% a year ago.  Turning now to slide eight. Sales in the Snap-on tools group of $484.1 million increased 49.7% from $323.3 million in 2020, reflecting a 46.7% organic sales gain and $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a gain of approximately 40% in our U.S. business and a gain of approximately 80% in our international operations, with strong growth across all product lines.  Net sales in the period increased 19.3% from $405.8 million in the second quarter of 2019, reflecting a 17.1% organic sales gain and $7.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, sales in the U.S. operation were up 18.8% in that period, while franchisees sales of the van versus 2019 were up 21%. Gross margin of 46.8% in the quarter improved 510 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes, benefits from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25.4% improved from 29.8% last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes. Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $103.5 million compared to $38.4 million last year. The operating margin of 21.4% compared to 11.9% a year ago, an improvement of 950 basis points.  Turning to the RS&I group shown on slide nine, sales of $398.6 million compared to $245 milling a year ago, reflecting a 54.1% organic sales gain, $11.9 million of acquisition related sales and $6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase reflects a rise of approximately 80% in sales of undercar equipment, as well as a gain of approximately 50% in sales to OEM dealership and an increase of approximately 30% in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $49.7 million from $348.9 million, reflecting an 8.4% organic sales gain, $15.3 million of acquisition related sales and $4.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  Gross margin of 44.7% declined from 47.4% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by 70 basis points of benefits from acquisition. As a reminder, undercar equipment, as well as the facilitation program related activity, both of which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically have a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment\u2019s average.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% improved 380 basis points from 26.7% last year, which included 50 basis points of restructuring costs. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from lower costs related to restructuring were partially offset by 190 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $86.7 million compared to $50.6 million last year. The operating margin of 21.8% compared to 20.7% a year ago.  Now, turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $86.9 million compared to $84.6 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $68.9 million compared to $57.6 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $18 million decreased $9 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses resulting from $2.8 million of lower year-over-year net loan charge offs, as well as favorable loan portfolio trends which support lower expected reserve requirements. As a percent of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were eight-tenths of 1% and 1.3% in the second quarter of 2021 and 2020 respectively.  In the second quarter the average yield on finance receivables of 17.5% in 2021 compared to 17.6% in 2020. The respective average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 8.2%. The lower yield on contract receivables in 2020 includes the impact of lower interest business operations support loans for our franchisee. These loans were offered during the second quarter of 2020 to help accommodate franchisee operations in dealing with the COVID-19 environment. As of the end of the current quarter, approximately $8 million of these business operation support loans remain outstanding.  Total loan originations of $285.8 million in the second quarter increased $30 million or 11.7% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 17.9% increase in originations of finance receivables, while originations of contract receivables were down 11.5%. Last year's contract receivable originations included the aforementioned offering of business operation support loans to qualified franchisees during the second quarter of 2020. Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $13.2 million in the second quarter, primarily due to the higher originations.  The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.2% in the United States extended credit is up 20 basis points from the rate of 1% in the second quarter of 2020. As we commented during our second quarter 2020 earnings call, we estimated in the quarter the 60-day plus delinquency rate was favorably affected by 20 to 30 basis points as a result of forbearance and deferred payment programs in place during that period last year. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12 month net losses of $41.6 million representing 2.4% of outstandings at quarter end is down 15 basis points sequentially and down 53 basis points compared to the same period last year.  Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $238.2 million in the quarter decreased $15.4 million from comparable 2020 levels, primarily reflecting the higher net earnings more than offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including $98.4 million of higher income tax payments. The increase in cash paid for income taxes reflects both higher levels of taxable profitability, as well as the IRS no longer allowing companies to defer estimated tax payments as compared to the IRS accommodation offered during the second quarter of 2020.  Net cash used by investing activities in the $29.7 million included net additions of finance receivables of $18.7 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $147.9 million included cash dividends of $66.7 million and the repurchase of 566,900 shares of common stock for $137.4 million under our existing share repurchase programs, partially offset by proceeds from stock purchase and option plans of $61.8 million. As of quarter end, we have remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $251.6 million of common stock under existing authorizations.  Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $4.7 million from 2020 year end. Day sales outstanding of 56 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year end. Inventories increased $14.4 million from 2020 year end, but on a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.4 at year end 2020.  Our quarter end cash position of $965.9 million compared to $923.4 million at year end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 10.8% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there are no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.  That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I\u2019ll now briefly review a few of the guidance for 2021. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million. We currently anticipate absent any changes the U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks Aldo. Well, at the beginning I said I would speak on what this all means, I want to try. First, it means that Snap-on and its markets are resilient. The virus, probably the greatest threat to our society and to business and in many decades it was a great shock. Miles driven down big dealerships, many furloughed, no travelers, aviation, no travelers, oil and gas and free-fall [ph] and education, virtually little need for equipment, nobody is in the classrooms, and yet we weathered this shock without trauma.  The credit company stepped in with just the right bridging at just the right place for customers and franchisees and our direct selling vans kept rolling, quickly accommodating to the environment. Snap-on kept investing in our product, our brands and our people, and we accommodated and recovered to post four straight quarters of above pre-pandemic results, tracing a B shaped recovery and emerging from the height of the storm stronger than we entered, resilience against the greatest business threat in memory. But it's more than resilience, more than bounce back, it also demonstrates great flexibility. As the world passed through this shock, through accommodations of psychological recovery, change was the order of the day and Snap-on adjusted. Fuel by our fortified advantages and product brand and people, we accommodate it. The pandemic limited face-to-face interaction. We expanded virtual contact and came away with some long term social media tools that will enable our franchisees for some time.  When technicians focused on shorter pay back items, we gave them hand tools and power tools and torque. When repair leaned away from maintenance to complex repairs and the shock, we provided ADAS calibration tools and intelligent diagnostics and helped our franchisees expand their selling capacity to manage those more complicated offerings efficiently.  When some critical industries weaken, we developed offerings for those that maintained. When the virus attenuated the distributors in Europe, we focused on customization and more direct interactions. All of that achievement in a time of change demonstrate Snap-on\u2019s flexibility and confirms we can prosper mid-future change going forward as we've always done, by observing work and solving whatever the new problems are.  Snap-on\u2019s second quarter, tools grew up in all geographies and in all product lines. Sales up 17.1% compared with 2019 and OI margins up 21.4%. C&I gains offsetting the challenges of the lingering COVID, rising profitability to 15.8%, up 120 basis points from the pre-pandemic level, even with the 90 basis point impact from unfavorable currency.  RS&I, sales up 8.5% versus 2019. Undercar equipment and OEM projects recovering in an OI of 21.8% down from the pre-pandemic, but still strong. In Snap-on overall sales is up 9.3% organically versus 2019, an OI margin of 20.1% and an EPS at $3.76, up meaningfully versus every comparison. It was an encouraging period again, demonstrating resilience and flexibility. Encouraging for the now and we're confident, encouraging for the prospects of growth and improvement for the future on through 2021 and well beyond.  Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Your support is the fundamental element in driving our continuing positive trend; for your role in helping our society and our company to navigate the pandemic, you have my admiration. For your contributions in offering this quarter\u2019s strong results, you have my congratulations; and for your continued commitment to the Snap-on team, you have my thanks.  Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey! Good morning guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Bret Jordan : When you think about the mechanic in the tool segment, you know I guess demand has been very strong, we're hearing a lot about labor rate inflation. Are you seeing a real change in their buying patterns that they are more liquid than they have historically been, and you know more biased to pay cash for higher ticket items I guess? Nick Pinchuk : I think it's a combination of that. I think they are. I think they are and our franchisees are more flush and therefore they are able to underwrite the shorter payback that even for bigger, even for a medium ticket items which might have going on EC before the franchisees are willing to underwrite it and let them pay RA.  I do think the technicians are kind of \u2013 have good cash, because the business has been going well for quite a long period of time and they are interested in continually investing in tools, so you see that as a factor. I mean that's certainly a factor in the business. And one of things we see is, is that you'll notice that RA is very strong versus EC in this quarter and we see that as you know the technicians are buying and still have capacity to buy more in the future, because they have borrowing capacity under our EC. Bret Jordan : When you think about the technicians as they relate to this next round of stimulus on the child tax credits, do you have any demographic color as to whether they are more or less likely to have kids that are going to give them a stimulus check? Nick Pinchuk : You know, I don't know, the technician population is pretty spread. I wouldn't say they are more or less. In fact I think they are \u2013 I think they are the kind of the average, the every man. There are old technicians and young technician, so I don't think there's any particular concentration. You know you don't go into a garage and see all young people. You don't go see all old people either, so I don't think there's any particular position in that and they have some kids, but not different than the regular population. By the way, you know Aldo has to apologize for his voice. He was at the Deer District overnight at the Bucks game, so he's a little under the weather. Bret Jordan : Thanks guys. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Curtis Nagle with Bank of America. Curtis Nagle : Thanks very much. Just a quick one. You just \u2013 I got to ask this, because you brought it up a couple of times in the prepared remarks about new social media tools. Could you expand on what you're talking about, what these tools are, your targeting new customers? [Cross Talk] Nick Pinchuk : They are no so much \u2013 sure, they target new customers, but what I\u2019m really referring to hear without \u2013 I didn't want to get into in the remarks because there\u2019ll be a lot to say and I don't. Really what this is we used social media before, but in the pandemic we realized a more effective way to use them was to pre-brief customers, in other words to contact them. You know at first we started out by saying, okay, we want to stay in touch with our customers via social media or any electronic means that could do it at a distance, but then we realized, Boy! It's a powerful tool for making for sales efficiency when you're actually in front of them.  Because what you can do is contact them on the social media, you have a relationship with them, you can pre-brief them about how a great new prod \u2013 what the elements of a particular new product is, like the 14.4V power tool I talked about or the Techwrench I talked about and then you can also pre-brief them on any promotions we might have. And so then when you're actually spending the time in front of the technician, you can spend your time closing the deal. This kind of shrinks the time and so it takes some of the pre-sell out of the face time and makes it more efficient, that's what we're talking about here. We learned how to do that very well in this \u2013 in the pandemic and that's going to serve us well.  And as part of the idea, remember I always said that the pacing element for sales through the tools group has been the franchisees time where they are hitting new limits. They are up 17% versus pre-pandemic levels and it's because we've expanded their capacity. Curtis Nagle : Got it, okay. And just you know a follow-up, just any general comments in the U.S. tools group in terms of competition with your \u2013 well your close competitors Matco and anything \u2013 any notable changes relative to your last quarter? A - Nick Pinchuk : Jeez, I don't know. I can tell you \u2013 you know I just spent. We were \u2013 Aldo and I were just in California talking to our franchisee. You know we were out there visiting plants and we visit franchisees and I was at the NFAC at our Algona plant and I was like, those guys think they're crushing it. So I don't know what that means in terms of market share, but it sounds good to me. Curtis Nagle : Got it, okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Stember with C.L. King. Scott Stember : Good morning, guys and congrats on the Bucks win. Nick Pinchuk : The Bucks, yeah this is NBA Championship Headquarters right here. Scott Stember : Just talking about in tools you guys said that everything was up pretty much. It sound like tools led the way, hand tools. Can you talk about the diagnostics? [Cross Talk] Nick Pinchuk : Excuse me Scott, I didn't actually say that. Hand tools did not lead the way this quarter. It was up big, but actually the best year-over-year number was tool storage. Scott Stember : Oh okay. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, but they were all big. I mean when you compare it to 2020, everything looks great you know. I mean it's all great, that was the nature of downturn. But there is no doubt, what I tried to say with that, all products, all geographies, just our way of saying that tools group had a gangbusters quarter. Scott Stember : Got it. And any comments on tools, I mean on sales off of the van versus sell-in. The last couple of quarters you had sounded like it was pretty much in line. A - Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, I think Aldo said \u2013 yeah, they are generally holding in line and like Aldo said, it was what, you know we were up 17% versus pre-pandemic levels and sales of the van were up 21 I think or something like that. So I think you know it's going pretty well, just rolling through the van. Scott Stember : Good. And lastly on Europe, European within Snap-on tools, tremendous growth there. Maybe just speak to what's been driving the recovery there and did you give \u2013 for Europe at least, are we back to pre-pandemic levels for tools? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, Europe is above pre-pandemic levels. Now, okay to be fair you know, Europe wasn't all that hot you know in 2019, but it's still clearly above the pre-pandemic levels. In other words it's offset whatever the impact of the pre-pandemic was. The tools group is pretty much across all geographies, which is kind of interesting, because there ain\u2019t no stimulus in the U.K. and Australia and Canada. Scott Stember : Got it. Thanks again for taking my questions. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : Good morning Nick, Aldo. Good talking this morning. Nick Pinchuk : Hi Luke. Luke Junk : So first question I had, a near term question. As we get further into the psychological recovery post the onset of COVID, we saw an increase in originations both year-over-year and sequentially this quarter. Nick, as you put your finger on the pulse of bigger ticket purchases, tool storage especially, do you feel like we're getting closer to or may be already at an inflection point in terms of mechanic attitudes around discretionary spend right now? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, I think we are. I mean I don't know. Who \u2013 you know it could be famous last words Luke you know. You got a lot of people talking about the delta variant and all this stuff, I don't think so. I think the people of work, the people in the factories and the people in the garages, like I\u2019ve said on other calls, are kind of thinking you know they've weathered the storm you know and they're not going to get shocked again no matter what, and so I think they kind of changed their level, they are starting to recover, and so you start to see people \u2013 you know we saw it in our tool storage numbers. One of the reasons why we took the franchisees, you know the franchise council to Algona, our tool storage plant, is everybody is screaming for more tool storage. Now, one of the effects was that when we entered the COVID they sold down their used inventory \u2013 their used boxes that they had taken in trade you know, so they had a lot of that rolling out, but still they are looking for boxes now, so I think things have turned.  The question is, are the franchisees so flush with cash that they want to finance some of those boxes or some of them, sometimes they sell them a locker, which is not quite as expensive as a box and they can afford to finance those kinds of things. But I do think, when I talk to franchisees, they are telling me that they\u2019ve kind of turned the corner. They\u2019ve turned the corners probably to \u2013 maybe too binary a word for it you know. We were coming back though. Things are pretty optimistic in the shops. Luke Junk : Good, that\u2019s helpful. And second, wondering, looking forward here, how we should think about the impact of the franchisee conference this year. What I'm wondering is both in absolute terms, i.e., what is that event going to look like this year, and also in relative terms given the unique nature of last year's virtual conference. A - Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, look it's going to be bigger than any of the conference, we think, who knows? We still got a few weeks ago, but registrations are higher than they've ever been. When I talk to the franchisees, they are really excited about going, no matter who I talked to. I heard \u2013 they were always kind of optimistic about it, but this one is really big, because it's \u2013 you know we're celebrating our 100th really and they\u2019ve been kind of \u2013 and they\u2019ve been away for \u2013 they didn't have it last year, so they are really, really talking about it, so it\u2019s going to be bigger I think, and so what will the effect be.  I\u2019ve said for dogs age on these calls that the third quarter can be a little bit variable, because there's a lot of wind \u2013 you know how many people go to the franchise conference, do they take more weeks, what happens in Europe and so on, but I'm telling you, I am not forecasting any weakness or anything like that. I'm just telling you, you never know how those things are going to turn out, but I like how we\u2019re entering the quarter, I like our moment you know. So I think whatever happens, we'll make the best of it. We're in a great position to navigate the quarter.  Hello? Okay, he was \u2013 he had to go to the Bucks celebration, so okay, don\u2019t ask right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Okay Chris. Christopher Glynn : Aldo, feel better. Aldo Pagliari : Yeah, I got it Chris, I got it covered. Christopher Glynn : Alright. So you know great commentary on the momentum and the overall buzz around the operations. The counts are kind of binary into the back half and you know your language around tools is that the momentum is so robust, you know storage sold out. So you know I think you were a little more hedged the last couple quarters about what current run rates mean for continued growth, but what I'm hearing is you're very confident and you can continue to compound not just overall, but at SOT. So I just wanted to bounce that off you, if I\u2019m kind of hearing you right. Nick Pinchuk : You know you're not going to get me to forecast the quarter, you know what I mean. I'm not going to say you know we're going to build on a 17 \u2013 they were upward over 17% increase over pre pandemic levels. But all I'm saying is the tools group, the reason why we say all products all geographies is we can't find anything wrong with it, and we always can find warps in some places you know, this is a good, you know what I mean, so we like our moment. How that plays out in the third quarter, I'm not sure.  You know you've been on the call. We\u2019ve been on these calls a long time and I've always said that the third quarter is not \u2013 I'm saying I like our momentum. I think we're going into the quarter really strong. We feel stronger than last quarter, but I will add that I've always said that the third quarter is not necessarily a trend indicator, whether it's way up or way down, it has to do with all that windage, you know how many how many vacations to people take in Europe is one big thing, and the franchisees are allowed to take the same vacation as last year or more, I don't know, but I do think I haven't seen the tools group this strong. Christopher Glynn : Okay, great. And just a more pointed question. Are you seeing an increased uptake in interested and franchisees adopting second associates over the past couple months. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah well, if you \u2013 you know I don\u2019t know. I think \u2013 look it\u2019s starting to come out of the thaw, because I think you can imagine why people are a little more reluctant in the COVID. There\u2019s a lot of interaction questions, a lot of viscosity and that kind of thing. I think they grew by 2% to 2.5% sequentially, so that's not bad I think.  So whether that has to do with the thaw or actually people getting more excited, I don't know. I do think when I talked to franchisees, they do more quickly go to the conversation. Gee! May be I ought to get a \u2013 I\u2019m doing so many, so much business, maybe I better get a franchisee. The guy in California was just talking about that. This guy just started like a few years ago. He signed up for a competitor and then he was talking to the guy and he said, you ought to go \u2013 the guy was sold him the thing. He wanted to go to the best, so he came to Snap-on and the thing is this guy is so pumped, he is going up so far, he's talking about, gee, maybe I could do more with an assistant. I need an assistant and a lot more and more people are doing that. So we would expect some expansion in this area. Christopher Glynn : Great! Thanks. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Hey! Good morning everyone. And Nick, congratulations on a really strong quarter. Just outstanding growth, outstanding results across the enterprise. So I guess I wanted to understand, just a couple of housekeeping questions. What was the changer of provisions? If you mentioned that, I missed it. Nick Pinchuk : Change? Sorry Dave, change of provisions? David MacGregor : Yeah, a question for Aldo. Didn\u2019t you\u2026 Aldo Pagliari : Specifically David, we said that the charge offs were lower by $2.8 million. But the charge-offs are just one of the indicators. When you look at your overall provision for losses, its down about $9 million to cut to the chase, but that's based on an assessment of what is the reserves side that we think we need for expected losses over the duration of the portfolio, which runs a little over four years on average, so that's the change of order.  But again as you\u2019ll see \u2013 you'll get more information obviously when the Q comes out, but if you look at charge offs are lower, the 60 plus day delinquency rate is lower, the net trailing 12 month losses are lower. The recoveries are better, the non-performing loans number are lower, the amount of past due accounts are lower. So you\u2019ll put that all together and that what\u2019ll arrive \u2013 lets us arrive at the conclusion that the reserves were able to be reduced somewhat. David MacGregor : Sure, that makes sense. But $9 million is the number, that\u2019s what I was looking for.  I guess my question is, I guess going back to the whole discussion around originations and Nick, you talked about the fact that the technicians are just in better shape today than they've been in a while. I guess you know a lot of stimulus and a little wage growth will do that. But I just wondered right now to what extent you think the slower origination growth may be attributed to technicians. Again, because they're in better shape, just qualifying for lower cost credit from alternative sources and they are just going on. Nick Pinchuk : Well I, you know I have a tougher time figuring that out. I don't think so though, because it might be, it might be in the U.S. I don't think \u2013 I actually don't think David, I don't think stimulus is a much of a factor, maybe some, because you know we have pretty good growth in international operations. We don't see as clear a pumping of the money into the economy. So when we look at it across the world, it doesn't seem as though that specific characteristic of America is a factor. I don't know \u2013 maybe, but I tend to think it's more a combination of the franchisees feeling more flush.  You know you kind of got an interesting interaction. You have people who at first were leaning toward shorter payback items, and maybe that expands to away from hand to you know past handled tools up into lockers or spiffier [ph] tops for tools storage boxes which are more, which are more fundable by the franchisees over time. Franchisees like to build their shorter term credit, so they like that, and it is true that the technicians do have more cash. I mean they've been working all through the pandemic, and so that that's kind of built up in a relative cash. It could be eligible for other credit, we have no way of knowing that. I don't hear anybody mention it though.  Now, I talked to a lot of franchisees and they may not necessarily mention, but we haven't heard, we have heard that particular thing come up in any environment, so I don't know. David MacGregor : Yes, it\u2019s an interesting dynamic. I guess we\u2019ll watch and see where it goes. You talked about the strength in storage, which I guess was surprising to hear and certainly strength to me is counterintuitive given \u2013 it's hard to think of another product you sell that would be more carbon steel intensive, and given you know cold rolled steel now hitting $2,000 a ton this week, you know there has been an awful lot of inflation which I'm assuming you past through. So is there just no elasticity there in storage or are legacy storage sales kind of flat and what were you seeing the growth on \u2013 why this new product introductions? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah, no it was a strong quarter in storage. I think somewhat, I'd like to think our offerings are kind of spiffier than they have been. You know I talked about this extra wide, the 72 inch master series in the call with the lighted top, those things are statement makers in garages, and I think that having refrained from some this for a period of time, technicians are getting more anxious to buy them and they have the money and they get are getting a little more confident, so they go out and look at them. That\u2019s really \u2013 I think that's the situation. I wouldn\u2019t say there is no elasticity, but I think you know \u2013 I mean is there elasticity with new cars. I mean the thing is people are buying new cars and reused cars and so on. I mean so I think when people want something in this category, which is I\u2019ve often said, I think you and I have had conversation that a tool storage box like car, so people tend to want them and they\u2019ll pay a little bit more. It\u2019s not no elasticity, but people will go up and pay from them, that's my analysis.  It's really the psychology and the need. A combination of need and psychology and our biggest cycle \u2013 the product we have, which is the biggest psychological factor in people buying is tool storage. Now, all I can tell you is, our tool storage plant is sold out, sold out. David MacGregor : Yeah, that\u2019s fantastic, that\u2019s great. I guess, you talk about the strong growth in storage. How much of that growth was from some of the new products? I guess what was the legacy product growth looking like? Nick Pinchuk : Well look, I think when I say \u2013 I don't know, I don't have that number at my fingertips, but there's a lot of wrinkles you can put in tool storage you know. Like we wouldn't necessarily call a new color a new product. On the other hand, if you roll out a new color, remember when we rolled out purple, there was an explosion you know, so some of that happens. It just has to do with the wrinkle that makes it, oh! This is the best box in the shop or it\u2019s the newest thing, that's really what happens. So we are constantly doing that stuff. David MacGregor : I just want to wrap up, one last question, and I guess you know you kind of touched on this earlier in your conversation, so maybe I'll ask the question in a slightly different way, but I\u2019m just thinking about tool segment growth sort of going forward and prior to the pandemic tools were struggling with growth for a rather extended period of time, and certainly we are coming short of that 4% goal that you\u2019d set for the segment. Now, you know through the last four quarters, you know just sort of the easy compares are behind you, but you deliver remarkable growth through that period of time, including on a two year basis just to be fair. I guess if we think about the growth potential for the business now that you know you have four easy compares that are behind you, I guess what has changed the support or sort of growth going forward and what gives you confidence that the segment can track forward at greater than 4% when you were having so much [Cross Talk]. Nick Pinchuk : Okay, I\u2019ll tell you, it is this way, a simple statement. We figured out new ways to expand the selling efficient of the franchisees. This has happened before, there's a precedent for this. If you go back and you look before that term which you told, you know you said that they struggled for growth, and it\u2019s a fair characterization in some ways, between 11 and 16 the compounded annual growth rate was 7.2% and that was fueled by the expansion of the capabilities we found artifices [ph] would do that, the vans, the Rock 'n Roll Cab and so on, and in this case, we believe we\u2019ve broken through another ceiling to a new level and it's provable by the absolute amounts that are flowing through the vans at this point.  So that's certainly true for us and so we keep \u2013 we've always said, keep pounding that and we can sell more. We're not bound by the market; we are bound by our ability to sell. And so that's part of it, that's part of getting those franchisees to be able to deal with these more complex products, and we think we've made a step change over the last \u2013 now we\u2019ve been investing in it for like three years or something. You know trying to get that, but we think we've done it, and we think this is probable by the absolute amounts. Whatever the source of that volume is, it proves that the franchisees can accommodate it, they couldn't before. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Hey! Good morning everyone. A - Nick Pinchuk : Hey Gary! Gary Prestopino : Most of the questions have been answered, but I guess I just wanted to pick up on some of the things the last questioner was asking, as it relates to the margins. You know it looks like your tool and C&I margins from Q2 \u201819 have expanded fairly significantly, particularly the tools group. I mean is there anything that's inherently changed in the business or is that just the function of, that's just the leverage of the business with the sales growth? Nick Pinchuk : Well look, I think there is leverage you know in that situation, so that's good. I think it would be a mistake to overlook the idea that embedded in there is some pricing to offset. You know we\u2019ve got a whole bunch of \u2013 we've got material costs in there. I don't want to get in as its documented, but we got a great dollar for material costs. Anybody who's reading the press sees that the varying levels of steel we use from steel rod to plate steel to sheet steel and on have gone up tremendously. The costs of freight are up tremendously, yet through pricing and RCI we shove them aside and we got that 20.  So yes, there's leverage, but there's also great RCI in there that\u2019s dealing with the material cost, that\u2019s one thing to think about. So you got a combination of those and you have some other costs in there. I think we talked about it, I think you will see some of it when you see in the Q, but I do think it's a combination of those working very well. 21.4 I think might be the highest we've ever seen in the tools group, I don't know, but we kind of hope to get the highest every quarter actually. So I don't like to say that, but we're pretty pleased with that. Gary Prestopino : Okay, thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to now turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day! Operator : Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I will start the call by covering the highlights of our third quarter and along the way, I will give you my perspective on our results. They are encouraging. On our market, they are positive and more than resilient, and I will speak about our progress. It\u2019s been considerable each period demonstrating increasing strength even when in the midst of solvency and headwind. And we will also speak about what it all means to our future. It\u2019s incredibly promising. And then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. Our reported sales in the quarter were $1.377 billion. They were up 10.2%, including $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency and $19.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Our organic sales growth was up 7% \u2013 was 7%, gains in every group. It was our fifth straight quarter of above pre-pandemic performance and Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, all combined to drive that progress. And progress it was. Opco operating income of $201.3 million was up $15.6 million from last year. The OI margin was 19.4%, down 30 basis points, impacted negatively by acquisitions, but still very strong at a strong level. For financial services, operating income of $70.6 million increased 7.6% and the delinquencies were down even below the 2019 pre-pandemic levels, a continuing testimony to our unique business model and its ability to navigate the most threatening of environments. First quarter EPS was $2.57, up $0.29 or 8.8% from last year. And as I said before, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering and our third quarter results testifies to just that. Compared with 2019, before we ever heard of the virus, our sales grew $135.9 million or 15.1%, which includes $21 million from acquisition-related sales, $13.6 million of favorable foreign currency, and a $101.3 million or 11.1% organic gain. And that 2021 OpCo operating margin of 19.4% was up 80 basis points from the pre-pandemic levels, even while absorbing the impact of new acquisitions and while meeting what we can call a considerable disruption of these days. Now, let\u2019s talk about the markets. Water repair remains quite resilient. The technicians are prospering. They know they weather the depths of the COVID shock, learn to accommodate the virus environment and are well along the psychological recovery. Techs are resilient. They have been at their post for the last 18 months undoing it and they won\u2019t be shots again and they are optimistic about the future of their profession, about the outlook of individual transportation, and about the greater need for their skills as the vehicle park changes with new technology. Vehicle repair is strong \u2013 is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it in the franchisees voice and you can see it written clearly across our numbers every quarter. Also on auto repair, there are our shop owners and managers different from the techs. That\u2019s where our Repair Systems & Information Group, RS&I, plies its trade. Demand for new and used cars is high despite limited supply in dealership repair and maintenance and warranty is rebounding and dealers are starting to invest again. And we have been able to make \u2013 we have been able to take advantage with groundbreaking products like our award winning Tru-Point advanced driver assistance calibration system, our new diagnostic, our new diagnostic, TRITON-D10, Intelligent Diagnostic and our acclaimed Mitchell1 ProDemand repair estimating guide, all representing new technologies and data deployed to make work easier in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-on is poised to capitalize. Now, let\u2019s talk about critical indices which Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving task of consequence. These are commercial industrial as C&I operates. The virus had a much longer impact on these customers. They were slower to accommodate, but they are recovering. And in the quarter, our results showed that trend, gains in North America, Europe and in Asia, all over the globe. So overall, I describe our C&I markets as improving. And coupled with the strength of the auto repair sectors, our markets are beyond resilient and we are ready and well-positioned to make progress along those run-rates to recover. At the same time, it\u2019s clear that we have ongoing potential on our runways for improvement, the Snap-on value creation processes. They have never been more important, helping to counter the turbulence of the day, especially important with customer connection as understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology, driving new products. And just this quarter, Snap-on was prominently represented with 9 Professional Tool & Equipment News we call it P10 People\u2019s Choice Awards where the actual users, the technicians make the selection. We are also recognized with two P10 Innovation awards and we are honored with 2 Motor Magazine Top Tool awards. An essential driver of Snap-on growth is innovative product that makes work easier and the awards are the one are our testimony that great Snap-on products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task, becoming more essential to technicians and driving our forward progress. That\u2019s the environment, pretty positive. Now, we will move to the operating groups. In C&I, volume in the quarter rose 13.9% or $42 million versus 2020 on significant growth across all divisions, reflecting \u2013 reflected a $32.9 million or 10.6% organic uplift and $7.5 million from our AutoCrib acquisition. And double-digit growth in our European hand tool businesses and a high single-digit rise in critical industries led the way. C&I operating income of $52.6 million, was up $10.5 million or 24.4% and the operating margin was 15.3%. That\u2019s an increase of 130 basis points versus last year. I\u2019d say that\u2019s an attention getting rise against the wind. Now, compared to the pre-pandemic 2019 results, sales were up 4.8%, including a 0.9% organic gain and that OI margin of 15.3% was up 90 basis points against the 70 point impact of acquisitions and unfavorable currency. Once again, SNA Europe delivered double-digit growth beyond \u2013 double-digit growth beyond pre-virus levels against a complex and varied marketing environment propelled by the customization power of their Bahco ERGO Tool Management System. And our industrial division roles in critical industries, recording nice gains in general industry, heavy duty, education and U.S. aviation, a number of positive sectors overcoming weakness and continuing weakness in the military and natural resources. P&I is rising and we are enthusiastic about the possibilities. We will keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities and enabling that intent is our expanding lineup of innovative new products. And the third quarter did see some great new offerings like our 14.4-volt 3h-inch drive brushless reaction, the CDR861. It\u2019s already popular. And it\u2019s no wonder. It\u2019s a powerful combination of strength and speed, high torque, 60-foot bumps, the bus loose, very suborn bolts and rapid operations, 275 RPM for getting those fasteners off in quick time. It\u2019s made in our Murphy, North Carolina plant and it features a full frame brushless motor for longer runtime and durability. It includes a safety switch that shuts in an equipment safety switch that shuts down \u2013 shuts down the tool after 2 minutes of continuous use that\u2019s eliminating the chance of overheating. It also has a super bright 18 aluminum front-facing light that stays illuminated after the trigger is released, allowing easy and immediate inspection of the work. This ratchet also features a built-in break that stops the tool from throwing or fasteners, which it seems like not much, but it\u2019s an important safety feature for technicians. And it also offers a great cushion grip that makes for more comfortable tool control even during extended use. The CDR861 power, speed and comfort, it\u2019s in a very compact package. It\u2019s a mighty might for accomplishing critical tasks and the professionals love it. Well, that\u2019s C&I, continuing upward, exceeding pre-pandemic volumes, strong profitability and positions for more. Now, on to the Tools Group, sales of $471.4 million, up $21.8 million including $4.9 million of favorable currency and a $16.9 million or 3.7% organic gain, growth in the U.S. \u2013 both in the U.S. and the international operations. And the operating margin was 20.8%, one of our highest effort and up 140 basis points from last year. Compared with the pre-virus 2019 level, the organic gain was $80.4 million or 20.6% and the 20.8% operating margin was up 700 basis points compared with the pre-pandemic level, 700 basis points in the midst of operating turbulence. Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands and further enabling its franchisees, giving them more selling capacity, it\u2019s all working. Five strong quarters of above pre-pandemic performance says it so. Now, the third quarter is when we hold our \u2013 most of you know this, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, our SFC. This year\u2019s we are back again in person at the Gaylord in Orlando, Florida, over 9,000 attendees, a record. We have training seminars in sales growth and intelligent diagnostics. They were well attended and well received. And we had several football fields of products. So, our franchisees could get up close and personal with our latest innovations. For the franchisees, the SFC is an opportunity for learning, for touching and ordering new products and for recharging their Snap-on batteries and believe me, they are charged. For the company, the SFC is an opportunity to gauge the franchisees\u2019 outlook on the business. One quantitative way is orders. Well, they were up, strong double digits over last year\u2019s virtual live from the Forge event and from the 2019 SFC live in Washington, D.C. And when I say up, I mean all of our product categories showed substantial gains over both of those events. And so that\u2019s the quantitative look at it. Qualitatively, I spoke with many of our franchisees. And I can attest that they were beaming, showing a lot of confidence in our business and declaring considerable optimism on their future days and decades ahead with Snap-on. We do believe our franchisees are continuing to grow stronger each quarter and we continue to invest in our future. And if you were with us in Orlando, you would have seen it unmistakably and we are investing, building franchisees\u2019 ability to use the direct interface with technicians, enabling them to better communicate their unique capability and growing technology of Snap-on product lines. We have great confidence in the power of our products and there are real reasons for the confidence. You heard about the product awards. Well, beyond that, there is a continuous stream of terrific new offerings. During the SFC, the Tools Group unveiled its new KHP415, portable 40-inch substation power card. It\u2019s targeted at entry level technicians, the ones working on a narrow scope of repairs. It\u2019s built in our Albona, Iowa factory and the new card enables young mechanics to invest in Snap-on storage at a value price, while at the same time getting some very attractive professional features, a lockable comp compartment, fourfold distort and adjustable power tool rack that holds up the 10 tools and a power strip with 5 outlets and 2 USB ports for battery and device charging. New cart, it was well received. And it\u2019s quickly reaching what we call hit product status over $1 million of sales. It\u2019s raising upward on a steep trajectory. Beyond products, we spent time working to expand franchise\u2019se selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training and RCI and the van operations and it\u2019s working. Selling capacity is up and you can see it clearly in the 5 straight gangbuster quarters for our van network. The Tools Group is on a very positive trend, ascending and leaving pre-pandemic levels way behind. Nowon to RS&I. Sales were up 14.8% or $46.9 million, including a $31.7 million or 9.9% organic uplift. Growth was weighted toward undercar equipment, but our diagnostics and information businesses also chipped in with double-digit increases. Versus 2020, RCI operating earnings were $83.3 million, representing a rise of $3.2 million. Comparing with 2019, sales grew $41.7 million or 12.9%, including $24.2 million or 7.4% organic grain, nice growth. The RS&I OI margin was down versus the last 2 years, attenuated by business mix, acquisitions and currency, but it was still a strong 22.9%. So, we clearly see the potential of our runway with RS&I, expanding Snap-on\u2019s presence in the garage with coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. Third quarter annual growth was broad-based, but a strong double-digit rise in undercar equipment was an especially welcome turn. That\u2019s a nice turnaround and it was led by innovative products like our 15K four-post alignment lift. It\u2019s really taking a hold in the repair shops as they have resumed investing. This new 15K provides professional grade alignment lifting for a variety of vehicle sizes, with open front columns, best-in-class ultra-wide 26-inch runways, and integrated 100-inch show long-wear plates. It\u2019s suited to accommodate vehicles from compact passenger cars, compact passenger cars to big pickup trucks and it\u2019s low easy on approach angle makes it great even for low-profile sports cars that are often a challenge for other lifts. Made in our Louisville, Kentucky plant on an assembly line, it\u2019s made in our Louisville, Kentucky plant on assembly line, I am very familiar with. I participated in an RCI event for that process. Our new 15K has helped drive the recovery for undercar equipment and it\u2019s driven the rise in RS&I volumes. We are quite positive about RSI\u2019s possibilities to repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves, it\u2019s got a great future. So, that\u2019s the highlights of our quarter. Continued and strong progress, our fifth straight period exceeding pre-pandemic levels, C&I on track with strong sales and increasing profitability. RS&I, undercar, coming back, Tools Group, strong, pumped and moving vertically, the credit company solid in a storm and profitable, the overall corporation, organic sales rising 7%, Opco operating margin, 19.4%, and EPS of $3.57, a considerable rise. And most important, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than we entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I will turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. The third quarter of 2021 exhibited another period of solid financial performance. The results also compared favorably with the third quarter of 2019, which being a pre-COVID-19 time period in some cases may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1.377 billion in the quarter increased 10.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain, $19.5 million of acquisition-related sales, and $9.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 15.1% from $901.8 million in the third quarter of 2019, including an 11.1% organic gain, $21.0 million of acquisition-related sales and $13.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Consolidated gross margin of 50.2% improved 30 basis points from 49.9% last year. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volumes, 60 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company\u2019s RCI initiatives more than offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 30.8% increased 60 basis points from 30.2% last year, primarily due to 60 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Benefits from the higher sales volumes were offset by increased brand building, travel and other costs, including the restoration of our annual in-person Snap-on Franchisee Conference. Operating earnings before financial services of $201.3 million compared to $185.7 million in 2020 and $167.7 million in 2019, reflecting an 8.4% and a 20% improvement respectively. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 19.4% compared to 19.7% last year and 18.6% in 2019. Financial services revenue of $87.3 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $85.8 million last year, while operating earnings of $70.6 million increased $5 million from 2020 levels, reflecting the higher revenue as well as lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $271.9 million increased 8.2% from $251.3 million last year and 18.9% from $228.7 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.2% compared to 24.5% in 2020 and 23.2% in 2019. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 23.7% compared to 23.4% last year. Net earnings of $196.2 million or $3.57 per diluted share increased $16.5 million or $0.29 per share from last year\u2019s levels, representing an 8.8% increase in diluted earnings per share. As compared to the third quarter of 2019, net earnings increased to $31.6 million or $0.61 per share, representing a 20.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 11, sales of $351.4 million increased 13.9% from $308.4 million last year, reflecting a 10.6% organic sales gain, $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales, and $2.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain reflects higher activity in all of the segment\u2019s operations and includes high single-digit increases in sales to customers in critical industries. Within the critical industries, year-over-year sales gains were achieved in general industry, heavy duty and technical education, but were partially offset by declines in sales to the military and international aviation, both of which had particularly robust sales in the prior year period. As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 4.8% from 2019 levels, reflecting a $3 million organic sales gain, $7.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $5.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. As compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up mid-teens. With respect to critical industry sales activity in that period, our lower sales to the military international aerospace and natural resource segments offset gains in our sales to technical education, heavy duty and general industry customers. Gross margin of 38.2% improved 90 basis points from 37.3% in the third quarter of 2020. Contributions from the higher sales volumes and benefits from RCI initiatives were partially offset by higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% improved 40 basis points as compared to last year primarily due to the improved volumes, which were partially offset by higher travel and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $53.6 million compared to $43.1 million last year, the operating margin of 15.3% compared to 14% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8 sales of the Snap-on Tools Group of $471.4 million increased 4.8% from $449.8 million in 2020, reflecting a 3.7% organic sales gain and $4.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a mid-single-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit gain in our international operations. Net sales in the period increased 22.4% from $385.2 million in the third quarter of 2019, reflecting a 20.6% organic sales gain and $5.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 45.8% in the quarter improved 30 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes and 130 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects, which offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 25% improved from 26.1% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $98.2 million compared to $87.1 million last year. The operating margin of 20.8% compared to 19.4% a year ago, an improvement of 140 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9, sales of $364.4 million compared to $317.5 million a year ago, reflecting a 9.9% organic sales gain, $12 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase reflects double-digit increases in sales of undercar equipment and in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. While activity focused on OEM dealerships was essentially flat. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $41.7 million from $322.7 million, reflecting a 7.4% organic sales gain, $13.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $4 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 46.8% declined from 47.3% last year, primarily due to the impact of higher sales and lower gross margin businesses, increased material and other costs and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. These declines were partially offset by savings from RCI initiatives and 60 basis points of benefits from acquisitions. As a reminder, undercar equipment, which had healthy sales increases in the quarter, typically has a gross margin rate that is below the RS&I segment\u2019s average. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.9% increased 180 basis points from 22.1% last year, primarily due to 170 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $83.3 million compared to $80.1 million last year. The operating margin of 22.9% compared to 25.2% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10, revenue from financial services of $87.3 million compared to $85.8 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $70.6 million compared to $65.6 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $16.7 million decreased $3.5 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to lower provisions for credit losses, resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.8% and 0.9% in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the third quarters of both 2021 and 2020, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.8%. The respective average yield on contract receivables, were 8.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Total loan originations of $269.3 million in the third quarter increased $16.5 million or 6.5% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and a 9.5% increase in originations of contract receivables. Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. Our worldwide gross financial services portfolio increased $7.5 million in the third quarter. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.5% in the third quarter of 2020 and 1.7% in the third quarter of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points, reflecting the typical seasonal increase of 20 to 30 basis points we experienced between the second and third quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $42.7 million represented 2.48% of outstandings at quarter end, down 22 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $186.4 million in the quarter reflects 92.5% of net earnings. While this represents a decrease of $37.6 million from 2020 levels, this cash conversion rate compares favorably with 77.5% of net earnings in both the third quarters of 2019 and 2018. The decrease from the third quarter of 2020 primarily reflects the higher net earnings being more than offset by net changes in operating assets and liabilities, including a $61.9 million increase in working capital. This change in working capital is largely driven by the more typical seasonal inventory build in the third quarter of 2021 as compared to the reduction of inventory experienced in the period last year. Inventory additions also reflect some increases in buffer stocks and higher levels of in-transit inventories associated with the supply chain dynamics being seen in the macro environment.  Net cash used by investing activities of $29.7 million included net additions of finance receivables of $7.6 million and $16.2 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used by financing activities of $385.8 million included $250 million in senior note repayments, cash dividends of $66.3 million and the repurchase of 300,000 shares of common stock for $66.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $197.1 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $12.5 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 56 days compared to 64 days of 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $43.1 million from 2020 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.4 at year-end 2020. Our quarter end cash position of $735.5 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt to capital ratio of 10.3% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million in available credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I\u2019ll now briefly review a few outlook items for the balance of 2021. We now forecast that capital expenditures will approximate $90 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2021 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. The Snap-on third quarter can be summarized in one word, momentum. Our markets are showing extraordinary possibilities, almost across the board with order repair the most advanced going beyond resilience. We sold the COVID-19 playing out with our customers in three phases, shock, interruption in the face of virus uncertainty, a combination of gradual learning to pursue essential work while staying safe and psychological recovery, our confidence in the future and return to normal buying. But now we\u2019re seeing a fourth phase, exhilaration of certainty that we\u2019re moving sharply to higher levels, ignited by the conviction that we have met and manage the virus and they want \u2013 and that we won\u2019t get shocked again. It\u2019s a bright outlook. And Snap-on with continuing investment in product and brand and people is well positioned to serve that trend. Of course, the COVID is still lingering, and its side effects, inflation and supply disruption around the loose, but Snap-on is strongly arrayed to engage those challenges. A direct selling model and strong brand position enables agile pricing. Our vertical integration and shorter supply chains make us less vulnerable to sourcing viscosities. Our broad product line, more than 80,000 SKUs supports flex \u2013 flexible marketing to guide around shortages, and our RCI culture drives cost offsets. We found opportunities on our runway for growth and improvement even amidst these challenging times, and you can see it in the numbers, encouraging. C&I sales up from \u2013 both from last year and 2019, OI margin, 15.3% strong and rising 130 basis points and 90 basis points versus 2020 and 2019, respectively. RS&I, up organically, 9.9% versus last year and 7.4% beyond the pre-pandemic levels. OI margins of 22.9%. And the Tools Group, organic volume rising 3.7% versus last year\u2019s record level and up 20.6% versus the day before the virus. OI margin, it was 20.8%, up 140 basis points from last year and up 700 basis points from 2019. It all led to our corporation being organically up 7% compared with last year and a strong 11.1% versus pre-pandemic numbers. Overall, OI margin was 19.4%, solid in the face of turbulence in our credit company, navigating then certainly without disruptions. Profit is up, delinquencies down. And EPS, $3.57, rising emphatically versus all comparisons. We have emerged from the virus stronger than when we entered, and the numbers confirm it. We\u2019ve now recorded five, five straight quarters of above pre-pandemic performances, and we believe that with our markets reaching beyond resilience to exhiliration with the capabilities of our model to overcome the challenges of the environment, and with a considerable advantage nurtured by our continuing investment in product, brand and people will continue to rise, maintaining our upward trajectory through the end of this year and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I always know you\u2019re listening. This is a period of great momentum for Snap-on. You are the fuel that is ignited and fan that drive forward and upward. For your success in creating this encouraging performance, you have my congratulations. For the capabilities you bring to bear in achieving our progress every day, you have my admiration. And for your commitment to our present and your confidence in our future, you have my thanks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Chris. Christopher Glynn : So Snap-on tools looked really good sequentially is usually down about 5% seasonally. I think it was down about half that, suggests little incremental commercial execution taking place. Wondering if you think I\u2019m looking at that a little too closely or how you might characterize that? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think, look, I think they are certainly on an upward trajectory. So that would include better sequential performance. I think that\u2019s quite true. We\u2019re pretty \u2013 as I\u2019ve used many times in my comments, we were encouraged by this performance and they seem to be rising. If you look at pre-pandemic levels, which is the appropriate comparison up big and their operating margins are strong. And this is a turbulent time, and they are managing over it. And doing well. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And curious, you talked about vertical integration, shorter supply chain, that\u2019s clearly characteristic. But probably not necessarily for every product you have. So I\u2019m wondering if you did kind of have kind of a general kind of quantification of any revenue gaps in the quarter that created some backlog build given the widespread dynamics. Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Nothing I can put my finger on. Look, I mean, I think it\u2019s the place you would expect to see that might be in the critical industries where we have a huge range of products, we put together these big kits and you have to ship them complete. So you might have a kit with 1,000 items in it and you have to ship it complete, yet that business was up pretty well in the quarter. C&I was up nicely in the quarter, and that led critical industries led the way. So I don\u2019t think I can put my finger on any of that. Of course, we had some of that. But we overcame it. Part of it is, like I said, agile marketing, allowing yourself, okay, I got something else to sell. So I think generally, it\u2019s not like we weren\u2019t without impact, but we kind of overcame it. It\u2019s sort of like \u2013 you remember \u2013 you probably don\u2019t remember this Saturday Night Live, Roseanne Roseannadanna, it\u2019s always something. And this is just something of the day and it\u2019s our job as managers to get through it. Christopher Glynn : So, right school of management. And so also, just to comment on the balance sheet the stocks down 5% or 6% this morning. You\u2019ve got SOT compounding nicely off of 16% prior year organic. Any kind of fresh thoughts on using the balance sheet to address what looks maybe like a little disconnect between performance and reaction? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I don\u2019t know the electrodes that are implanted in my body giving me the stock price at every moment. I haven\u2019t looked at yet. No, actually, we didn\u2019t see that it was down necessarily. But look, I don\u2019t know, we take advantage of situations. So I don\u2019t know. We say that we\u2019re trying to be agile in terms of share buyback. So I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Operator : Thank you. We will now move to our next caller. Next, we have Scott Stember with CL King. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Scott Stember : Could you break out within the Tools Group? I don\u2019t know if you gave this before hand tools versus some of the bigger ticket items health, how those perform versus last year? Nick Pinchuk : I\u2019m trying to get off the quarter-by-quarter train of looking at product lines because I don\u2019t know whether they mean that much, but I will tell you that hand tools were down this quarter actually versus what we\u2019re, I would say, in condescent levels of Q3. And the bigger ticket items were up in aggregate double digits. So I think that kind of sets kind sort of a reversal of what\u2019s going to happen in lately. And that \u2013 I think that gray actually even though the margin was 28.8% \u2013 20.8%, that\u2019s kind of a drag on margins because the highest margin business is hand tools for us in the Tools Group. So that\u2019s kind of an interesting observation, I think, in that regard. But it seems like, at least for our franchisees that tool storage and diagnostics were getting a little more prominent at this time. Of course, euro versus the pre-pandemic levels, they were all up nicely. It has to be to contribute to the 20.6%. Scott Stember : Right. So but at least on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re talking like last year\u2019s hand tools were just through the rest? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Handles tools were down. But \u2013 okay, it\u2019s like I said, it\u2019s always something. They go up and down like that. You can\u2019t read too much into a quarter, but that\u2019s what happened. But we kind of think that boy, it was encouraging to us to see tool stores come back double digits and diagnostics to be nice as well. Scott Stember : Alright. And the SFC, anything that stood out, it sounds like everything was up year-over-year or even versus 2 years ago, more importantly? But is there any products or any one area or line that really stood out? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t know. No, I wouldn\u2019t say \u2013 I don\u2019t think so. It seemed to all be good. I couldn\u2019t parse between. Of course, there are variances in that. I think tool storage very popular at the SFC actually. But I want to point out, Scott, these are all \u2013 there are orders. And so you never know. SFC \u2013 a great SFC doesn\u2019t guarantee a great finish to the year or first quarter next year. A bad SFC doesn\u2019t doom you to a bad one because you have a lot of other things that goes on between August and the end of the year in terms of selling and ordering and so on. But it\u2019s better than a poke than I would a sharp stick in everything, everything is up double digits. And if you were there, you would have been impressed. I mean the franchisees are pumped. I really mean it. They were \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a more enthusiastic. That\u2019s why we get the idea of exhilaration. I think, we\u2019re going beyond resilience when you\u2019re looking at the auto repair market in this situation. Scott Stember : Got it. And then last question on the EV side. I know you guys have worked with OEMs and have gained some, I guess, business-related tool kits that are specific in diagnostics to EVs. Is some of that embedded in some of the RS&I increases that you talked about for this quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s actually \u2013 yes, we have a couple of projects in this quarter. I think they are extending \u2013 we have one project that\u2019s extended for a couple of quarters, but it\u2019s added a couple \u2013 I think another vehicle this quarter where we have from one big manufacturer, we don\u2019t like to name them, but they have four or five EV models that are coming out, and we\u2019re providing a package to dealerships and metered out portion across the country. So there is some of that there. And then, of course, you\u2019ve got dealer FX that is still coming to fruition, but was up nicely quarter-over-quarter, still a little bit of a drag in terms of margins And it\u2019s something year-over-year. So that was pretty nice. We\u2019re seeing ourselves kind of get on that EV train, get in the early warnings. All these things are early warning. I mean when you\u2019re with EV, when you\u2019re getting projects with the OEM, that\u2019s an early warning on what the vehicle is going to need by the time they get into the business. And as dealer effects grows, we have a sort of like a neural network of early warning to see what\u2019s happened in the garage. So we\u2019re kind of positive about that, but it\u2019s a page, there aren\u2019t that many on the road yet. Scott Stember : Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks again. Nick Pinchuk : Okay, sure. Operator : Next, we will go to Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead. Luke Junk : Nick, Aldo, good morning. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning. Luke Junk : I got two questions this morning. First, Nick, you touched on the benefits of vertical integration in your comments to wrap up the prepared piece. Certainly, a lot of investor attention right now being paid to the supply chain issues and the environment generally speaking. So just hoping you could expand on any steps that you\u2019ve taken going into the fourth quarter and next year. Of course, we can see overall gross margin up 30 basis points year-on-year this quarter. You mentioned RCI-related benefits. I\u2019m sure there is some other factors going into that would it be safe to say that you feel like you\u2019re on the front foot in terms of addressing the current supply chain environment? Nick Pinchuk : Well, who knows? I mean, every day, there is something new, but I think we\u2019re \u2013 what I was trying to say was, Luke, we do take steps and our model enables those stacks to be particularly efficacious. The vertical integration means that we don\u2019t buy that much. Most of the stuff is in our house. If you think about a hand tool, Raw steel comes in the back of the factory. And basically, we add very little when it comes out to you\u2019re worried about steel. We buy the steel in the U.S., short of supply chain. We buy some of our chips in the U.S. And closer place. That\u2019s not bad \u2013 circuit boards, those kinds of things, so we have those things as well as one of the advantages we have, Luke, and we do this, we\u2019re very aggressive in spot buying. So we go out a spot buy because we don\u2019t buy large quantities of any one thing. If you\u2019re an auto manufacturer, I used to be in Ford. You\u2019re buying something for the new Mustang or for the Ford Focus or whatever it is, you\u2019re buying a lot of stuff and it\u2019s hard to \u2013 once that supply chain gets disrupted because the Shanghai port closes because of a couple of cases, you kind of have trouble to move \u2013 get any alternative. Well, if you\u2019re only buying a little bit, you go out, you find them in the intercity of the system, and we have our guys actively doing that. That\u2019s why we are not seeing so much in terms of shortage. It may be still a little cost increase, but then we\u2019re agile pricing. So we don\u2019t have such a big problem in that regard. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re not actively working because, boy, our people are putting a lot of energy into it, but if you look at the numbers, pretty well managed. Luke Junk : Thank you for that. And then maybe this might be a question for Aldo. Curious, what insights you draw looking at your current credit metrics in terms of end mechanic customer health and barn capacity from here. I guess specifically, I am looking at the fact that the finance bad debt expense was down quite a bit the last couple of quarters now. And while originations are up, the tools group top line is certainly growing quite a bit faster than originations, especially if I look at, say, a 2-year stack basis. So, just any thoughts there as well as if there is any qualitative feedback from franchisees that would be interesting as well? Thanks. Aldo Pagliari : So my view, Luke, would be that I think technicians themselves are in a better financial position than where they were maybe a year or 2 years or even back ago. I think that\u2019s a broad statement that applies to many industries. I think you hear that out of the big banks. I mean customers are better servicing their debt than they were before. I think they have more discretionary power and spending. And so far, they have been applying it to their indebtedness. And I think we see the same trends. It\u2019s our job to capture that incremental savings that they might be seeing if they are not borrowing as much as before in capturing business with tool sales. And I think you see that. So, the Snap-on tool sales being up more than originations, I think as I applaud the tools group by being able to entice customers to buy more stuff because they have more money. From what you read from the Bureau Labor statistics, technician wages is doing pretty darn good. So, they seem to be strong. They seem to have more flexibility in what they choose to buy, and they seem to like to buy our products. So again, they are in a better position, I think than they were a year or so ago. And of course, every quarter brings potential new changes. But right now, it\u2019s been running very favorable. And as a result of that, our going forward provision rates are lower than they might have been a year or 2 years ago. It\u2019s going back pre-pandemic, simply because of the debt servicing trends. Luke Junk : Good. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next, we move to Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Hi Gary. Gary Prestopino : Got a series of questions here. First of all, Nick as you talk to your franchisees, and you say they are like really pumped. I mean what \u2013 can you cite like two or three reasons why they are so optimistic about the repair industry for the next year or so that\u2019s reflected in their order rates? Nick Pinchuk : So, Cowan 5231 : Gary Prestopino : Okay. That\u2019s very encouraging. And then in terms of you saw a strong-double digit growth in orders out of the Snap-on Franchisee Conference, what was the growth in orders \u2013 well, the 2020 conference and even particularly in the 2019 conference. Do you \u2013 off the top of your head, do you remember how you came out of the\u2026? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t know, but it wasn\u2019t double digits. I mean and it wasn\u2019t as you know. It was probably \u2013 if I remember last year it was kind of a little bit less across \u2013 sort of across the board in 19, it was probably different ups and downs. So, some guys were up some products, I am talking about guys because I am thinking to the product managers. Some areas were up double digits and others were down. This thing was across the board double digits. It was maple. This is a game plus. Gary Prestopino : Yes. Great. And then just lastly, on the\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Gary, before you go away from that, I want to emphasize, like I said for this is orders, not sales, it\u2019s directionally indicative not \u2013 but better than a poke and I with a sharp stick, it tells you, you come away feeling good about this. We feel good about this better than we have of any SFC that have been around here. Gary Prestopino : Okay. That\u2019s fine. And then just lastly, on the diagnostic side. As older cars come into the park that have ADAS, is that directly affecting your end demand for some of your diagnostic products? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Well, it\u2019s actually broadly spoken, I think at first, it\u2019s certainly \u2013 it\u2019s affecting the \u2013 first, it\u2019s affecting the demand for Mitchell, which is up nicely, because Mitchell has got a very complete ADS suite in it, that\u2019s industry leading. And then it\u2019s also helping to drive the equipment business because the equipment I remember, equipment business is holding up. This conference was going to the dogs. And so the \u2013 the TruFit \u2013 ADAS system, which I talked about I think is something that\u2019s helping drive that undercar equipment growth. And that\u2019s where you set up a system that helps \u2013 that physically calibrates the system in the garage. And it\u2019s also driving some of the diagnostics. But the diagnostics with their intelligent features are probably yet to feel the impetus from that. You will see it coming in future quarters. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Sorry about the dog. Nick Pinchuk : That\u2019s okay. No problem. Operator : Thank you. We will now move to Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Liz Suzuki : Great. Thanks for squeezing in my question. Could you talk about what you are seeing in cost inflation and how much of the organic growth in the Tools segment is impacted by price increases as you pass through those cost increases? Nick Pinchuk : We are not going to go into that necessarily. I would say there is some price increase in there. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the major portion of the organic growth because price rolls through the system. We are seeing some cost increases, but the tools group has been able to manage that somewhat. To the extent you do get pricing offsetting cost increases, it tends to \u2013 it tends to knock down your margins because, of course, you get $1 of sales and $1 a cost that tends to do it. But it wasn\u2019t a major effect in this quarter. Liz Suzuki : Got it. And then Nick and Aldo, I think you have both touched on this a little bit in the prepared remarks and in the Q&A just about supply chain disruptions. I mean from a competitive standpoint, does this create an opportunity for Snap-on to meet the needs of your customers with some of your competitors that may do more importing, maybe more constrained on inventory? Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Well, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t speak for my competitors about being constrained. Actually, in reality to tell you the truth Liz, we \u2013 Snap-on is kind of interesting, it kind of works on itself. Our technicians either decide to buy Snap-on or they decide to buy another group of products. They hard \u2013 to choose from another group of products, they hardly ever say, \u201cOh, I am going to buy another product.\u201d And then say, \u201cOh, I will settle for the Snap-on as the other one isn\u2019t available.\u201d So, I am not sure how much that helps. It certainly puts us in a better position to grow and probably capture new customers who might not be serviced by these people. There is some of that, I think. But I don\u2019t really like to talk about the competition because we really compete against ourselves pretty much. The better we get, the more franchisees capability we have, the more they are able to sell, the better our product is, the more it grows regardless of what the competition does. Liz Suzuki : Great. Understood. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Next, we go to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. David MacGregor : I wanted to just start off by building on the last question. And I guess it would appear now so you are offsetting a lot of the cost inflation with volume growth in RCI. And I am just wondering what your expectations are for pricing going forward and your ability to price some of that cost inflation going forward rather than relying on volume growth in RCI? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look, I think first of all, I think I tried to make the case and I think it\u2019s quite true that we have a lot of insulation against that. We believe that we can price as we need to because you have \u2013 we have a direct model in a lot of cases where we are direct to the end customer versus some other people who are going through several layers. And then secondly, the brand position allows us always to be the price leader. So, we pretty much price relative to our prior products when we are doing normal pricing, David. When we are bringing out a new product, we look at where we are happy really where the competition is. So generally, I think to the extent we see costs arising, we can price against that. I don\u2019t have much worry about that. There is probably not in every nook and cranny of our business, but I think it\u2019s true in most of our business, particularly given that \u2013 given our brand position. David MacGregor : Got it. Next question, really, is there a way to sort of help us understand just what sales growth was off the truck, what the sell-through growth was in the quarter? Nick Pinchuk : No, I can tell you exactly. It was about the same as the sales growth to the truck. David MacGregor : Okay. Nick Pinchuk : I can\u2019t give you much insight on what was sold off the truck so much with such precision, but it was pretty much the same. David MacGregor : Was pretty close. So, how would you characterize truck level inventories right now, Nick? And maybe any way to hand tools versus bigger ticket items, it would be helpful? Nick Pinchuk : I would say everybody I talk to seems to be looking for tool storage. Now of course, that\u2019s a windshield survey. You are kind of familiar with those. But the thing is that you seem to see \u2013 I think there is a need \u2013 people want a little more tool storage. I think inventory, if anything are probably down some versus historical levels. Because, yes, this quarter we had equal, but in past quarters, sales off the truck kind of exceeded the \u2013 our sales to the truck. So, I think we have had \u2013 if you look back over the last three quarters, four quarters, five quarters, six quarters, you have seen that sales off the truck exceeded. So, I think inventories are kind of down. Now I don\u2019t know what that means. I am not sure that there is going to be a restocking or not. I kind of get the feel that maybe they may restock certain product. Tool storage was nice this quarter. I think off to demand. We had a nice \u2013 in fact, big ticket was nice double digits this quarter. So, it\u2019s kind of a little bit of a reversal of what\u2019s been happening previously. You haven\u2019t seen it yet fully in the originations, I guess. But look, I think there is a couple of things, I think one, it takes a while to work through that. And then secondly, I think people are kind of paid down their credit. So, they have got their kind of in a situation where they are able to buy some things that they are able to finance themselves. David MacGregor : Great. I guess just to pick up on your comment about credit. It seems like there has been \u2013 and you have talked about this yourself, there has been more rotation towards revolving account credit as opposed to extended credit over the last year or so. And just thinking about how that\u2019s playing out now, your franchisees, obviously, they are a little more liquid. And so maybe in a better position to be able to provide that revolving account credit. I am just wondering how \u2013 if you could update us in terms of what credit penetration rates look like for big ticket right now? Once upon a time, I think you told us big ticket was up \u2013 was about 90% credit, diagnostics was 50% to 60% credit. What would those credit penetrations look like in kind of this new world? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t really have that number, but it\u2019s somewhat lower now. Part of it is because I think just what you say, customer is a little more pros. The franchisees are a little more liquid. But also, make no mistake about this optimism floats in this. I mean the franchisees get a little bit more optimistic, and they say, \u201cHey, if I can put $1 in RA, I am going to get it back. It\u2019s a great investment for me. Why would I put in the bank or something.\u201d So there is some of that flow through the franchise system. What I \u2013 what we view is, I think for sure, is that the customers themselves have unused credit or untapped credit capacity. So, that will come up. We haven\u2019t really seen \u2013 there was a rotation at the beginning of the virus period toward RA. But this quarter, I would say it\u2019s kind of stayed solid. RA and EC have been the same as last quarter and maybe the quarter before that was the same way. So, we have kind of found that equilibrium right now. We will see how it plays out going forward. Whatever it has, it didn\u2019t impact our big ticket sales this time. David MacGregor : Yes. Congratulations there. And on the contract, $9.5 million versus the finance receivables, $5.7 million in terms of originations growth, contract has been out in front of finance receivables for a while now. Do you expect that to continue, or do you see that at some point or nearby kind of getting back to a more equal level or maybe finance receivables getting to a faster level of growth of contract? Aldo Pagliari : No, contract receivables tend to run up a little bit with the Snap-on Franchisee Conference because you get some short-term lower financing arrangements there. But no, there is nothing structurally there that would say that the EC will not get back to higher levels. And I would say EC was pretty decent and the U.S. was above the average in this case. So, they had strong performance and it was nice originations David, in both tool storage and diagnostics in the quarter. David MacGregor : Yes. Last question for me is just social media sales. And I guess you have kind of alluded to this in your comments, Nick, about online sales. But you don\u2019t have to look very far online to see franchisees selling tools through Facebook and other platforms. Can you just talk about how you foresee that growing? And does that accelerate? Does that help you in terms of your sales going forward? Nick Pinchuk : Actually David, I wasn\u2019t \u2013 in my comments, I wasn\u2019t talking about sales. I was talking about using social media to inform customers about products and promotions and other things, which frees up face-to-face time for actual selling. I don\u2019t really see social media sales as growing that much. I mean it\u2019s not much of a factor right now. Now it might, but I think generally, by and large, the overwhelming use of electronic media via the franchisees are just that to try to orchestrate. Okay, I want you to know about this. So, when I come in and I am going to tell you why you need it, that kind of thing. David MacGregor : Productivity. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. David MacGregor : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We have time for one additional question. Our final question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Nick Pinchuk : Bret Jordan. Ethan Huntley : Hi, good morning. This is actually Ethan Huntley on for Bret. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Ethan Huntley : Yes, could you just provide any color on the sales cadence throughout the quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Say that again. I didn\u2019t quite hear it. Could you say it again, please? Sales cadence? Ethan Huntley : Yes, correct. Yes, just on sales cadence. Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Look, it was pretty much the same as past quarters. I think generally, a little bit interrupted \u2013 if you want to go back to \u2013 I will give you this. If you go back 2 years beyond the COVID era, the third quarter was particularly aberrated by the franchisee conference. So, you get kind of a week early couple of months, certainly early one month in the quarter. July was like a wasteland. And so then things would come roaring back when you got the SFC, people would be keeping their powder dry pretty much. The last 2 years, we have been able to get out of that by a number of artifices. And so it\u2019s a much more standard where you have, of course, a quarter is 4, 5, and so you get kind of that kind of distribution, maybe with a little higher number in the last quarter, but it\u2019s nothing particularly special. I think this quarter of course is above. So, each quarter, it\u2019s kind of an upwards versus its prior numbers. And so you feel like the upward trajectory, you can see it if you look very, very closely at the month-to-month numbers in a quarter as you are going to \u2013 as we are going through the months and the quarters and the years upwards. But not much difference in distribution except for that sort of general monotonic trend. Ethan Huntley : Understood. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then another one here on the corporate expense, it was pretty high, $34 million, up about $10 million year-over-year and $5 million sequentially. I know you mentioned sort of performance-based comp and some brand building costs, but anything outside of those two buckets? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Well, the SFC was live this year. So, you think \u2013 look, think of it this way. Okay, we had brand building, we had stock \u2013 we had comp expense lease cost. And this was our celebration of our 100th anniversary. So, the SFC and the celebrations we had there were bigger than \u2013 bigger and better than any prior years. So, you have some of that into your situation because the franchisees are investing in the company. I think I said they are positive about the days and decades ahead with Snap-on. And so that merits a little bit of celebration when you reach a Centennial milestone. So, there is some of that in there. Ethan Huntley : Sure. Thank you. And then just one last one, if you don\u2019t mind. Given the strong business performance and cash flow, and I know you sort of mentioned opportunistically repurchasing shares, but where do share repurchases stand in terms of capital allocation given where the stock share is? Nick Pinchuk : We have a four-piece capital allocation. We tend to be working capital investors. You know what I mean, this is a working capital-intense company. So, when we grow, we tend to \u2013 the COVID kind of changed \u2013 not changed but obscure that dynamics somewhat. But generally as you grow you have working capital, then we look at acquisitions, we believe we have runways for growth, particularly in owners and managers and the garages or in maybe in C&I in some places. And we have done some of that and Dealer-FX is an example. We have a dividend that we have paid a dividend every quarter since 1939. We have never reduced it. So, we take a look at our dividend with the intent of perpetuity and whether we should increase it or not, and we look at that carefully. And then we are agile about share purchases. So, we have kind of a four-way look at that, and they are all \u2013 they are all a draw on what we might do with cash depending on the situation. Ethan Huntley : Thank you very much. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Ms. Verbsky, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : Thank you all for your attention. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. All participants may now disconnect.",

Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start with a view of our fourth quarter, give you an update on the environment and the trends we see and I'll take you through some of the turbulence we've overcome and the advancements we've made and Aldo will then, as usual, give you a more detailed review of the financials. The fourth quarter was encouraging. It affirm the characteristics that make Snap-on the company we know it to be, the resilience of our markets, the power of our strategic position and the consistent and capable execution of our teams. It all added up to momentum, cutting through the challenges and the numbers testified to just that. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1,108.3 million were up 3.2%, including $12.2 million from acquisitions being offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency exchange. Organically, our sales grew by 2.3%. Importantly, if you compare to the prepandemic levels of 2019, before the period-to-period variability of last year, you see a clear and unmistakable upward drive. Versus 2019, sales in this past quarter were up 16% as reported and 13% organically, continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion, increasing higher and higher over pre-COVID levels. The quarter also bears the marks of the Snap-on value creation processes. Safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, all combining to offer significant progress. The progress, there was. Opco operating income of $232.2 million was up $16.16 million point from last year and the OI margin was 21%, an all-time high, up 90 basis points from last year and 310 basis points from 2019, all achieved by overcoming the challenges of this day. For financial services, operating income of $67.2 million was down from the $68.5 million of last year. But delinquencies in the quarter were below both 2020 and those of 2019, an ongoing testament to our unique business model and it's ability to navigate through the most threatening of environments. And the combination of results from opco and financial services offered an overall consolidated operating margin of 25.1%, up from the 24.4% of last year and the 22.5% recorded in 2019. Our quarterly EPS was $4.10, well over the $3.82 of a year ago which included a $0.02 charge for restructuring. And that $4.10 was up 33.1% over 2019, a considerable gain in my book. Those are the numbers. Now, let's speak about the markets. We do believe the auto repair environment continues to be favorable. In the areas serving vehicle OEMs and dealerships, we do see some turbulence. New car sales around the world remain mixed, with China generally progressing but both North America and Europe having a tough fourth quarter. Overall volume below the 2019 levels and some new model releases and features were delayed by supply chain constraints and that impacted the associated essential tool programs that we are involved in. OEM projects aside, however, dealership repair, maintenance and warranty are all healthy. Techs are seeing good times and the dealers are looking to support their expansion in their shop. In effect, the OEM market is mixed but technicians are quite positive. There's a growing appetite for repair shop equipment but essential tool programs are attenuated. Now in the independent repair shop, it's a horse of a different color. Confidence is uniformly sky high. Based on what we hear from our franchisees, shop owners and technicians, optimism and independent repair shop continues to be strong. And our sales in that sector may reflect that confidence. So we believe, on balance, vehicle repair is a great place to operate for our tools too and for our Repair System & Information or RS&I Group. The critical industries where our Commercial & Industrial group play or C&I plays, we are seeing areas of progress but the lingering effects of virus have created headwinds. And the results in the quarter showed that trend with variations from country to country. A recovery in Asia and emerging markets but Europe being quite mixed. There are also differences from sector to sector. Education, natural resources and general industry showing improvement while the military spending continues to experience, what I'd say, a substantial challenges. Overall, however, I would describe our C&I markets as holding their own against the turbulence, public variation. We do believe we're well positioned and I think the numbers say this, to confront the challenges of this time, advancing a long ways for growth. We're also confident that we have continuing potential on our runways for improvement. The Snap-on Value Creation processes, they're a constant fuel for our progress, especially customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians; and innovation, matching that insight to technology. We believe our product lineup just keeps getting stronger every day and we keep investing to make it so. Vehicles are rising in complexity, technicians needs assistance and so products are becoming more sophisticated to match the changing requirements and Snap-on is keeping pace. In 2021, we had more hit $1 million projects than ever before. We've endeavored through the virus era to maintain our product, our brand, I've spoken of this before. And the virus era, we've endeavored to maintain our product, our brand and our people. And we believe that continuing commitment has served us well, offering positive results and creating substantial momentum for the days ahead. And that momentum is apparent in our full year results. Sales of $4,252 million, up 18.4% including an organic increase of 15.1% compared to last year and a 14% organic gain over 2019. Strong numbers. The as-reported opco OI margin for the year was 20%, a new high, up from the 17.6% of 2020, exceeding the 19.2% of the prepandemic 2019. As-reported earnings per share for the year were $14.92, up 30.4%, or 28.3% as adjusted for the nonrecurring restructuring and the restructuring in 2020 and up 21.7% as adjusted from 2019. All clear signs of ongoing momentum. Now, for the operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter sales of $358.7 million for the group were down $5.7 million, including $4.1 million of unfavorable currency. Versus 2019, sales grew $5.8 million, reflecting primarily acquisition volume and currency impact. The period saw a recovery in Asia with Indonesia. And in the quarter, we saw -- we did see a recovery in Asia with Indonesia, India, Japan, South Korea and China rising. Europe and North America were more impacted by the environment and were down slightly in the quarter. Looking at the sectors, nice progress with our precision -- was achieved in our precision torque line. And that progress was -- but that progress was more than offset by lower critical industry activity attenuated in those critical industries, primarily by lower U.S. military spending and by supply chain-driven constraints and in the custom kitting area. C&I operating income was $50.1 million, down $6.1 million, including $1.2 million of unfavorable currency. The gains in Asia and the torque were more than offset by the reduced military activity in the industrial kitting constraints. As I mentioned, however, specialty torque -- the specialty torque operation did register continuing progress driven by innovative new products, developed through customer connection and observational work. Great offerings like our recently released QB4R line of 3/4-inch Drive Break-Over Torque Wrenches, capable of -- this wrench is capable of accurately fastening from 450- to 750-pound feet. It's designed specifically for heavy-duty applications, tough jobs such as torquing lug nuts on big trucks. The new unit combines our Norbar, our regionally acquired Norbar industrial torque technology with a robust ratchet designs produced on Elizabeth and Tennessee factory. Those original light vehicle ratcheting mechanisms of our Tennessee plant were reengineered for higher tension heavy requirements and were directly matched to our unique Norbar breakover device which provides a clear indication that the torque target has been reached, ensuring reliable accuracy every time. The ratchet design with our patent steel head is rugged, capable of withstanding very high stresses and has an easy-to-read adjustment mechanism that reduces the possibility of error and is virtually maintenance-free. The new wrench also has a quick release feature for easy disassembly, compact storage and great portability. The Snap-on QB4R, we like to say strength, accuracy and convenience. And as you might expect, sales have been strong. As the need for precision increases, torque products are becoming more prominent and Snap-on is playing an active role in that rise. C&I, mixed results but significant areas of progress boding well for it's future. Now let's go on to the Tools Group. Sales of $504.8 million, up $9.9 million, including favorable currency and a $7.9 million organic rise from continued expansion in the U.S., a positive that was somewhat attenuated this quarter by a low single-digit decline in the international networks. But versus 2019, a more comparable base, the Tools Group rose 21.5% and has been up now from prepandemic levels for six straight quarters. And the operating margin was 21.9%, easily one of the highest ever, up 300 basis points from last year, all despite the ongoing challenges of this day. We have continued to invest in product, brand and people. And the Tools Group has used that focus to advantage. The expanding and considerable gains from the time before the virus makes that clear. In the quarter and throughout the year, the Tools Group results continue to confirm the leadership position of our van network. We believe the franchisees are growing stronger and that's evidenced in the franchisee health metrics we monitor each period. They're on an unmistakably favorable trend. And that positivity was acknowledged by multiple publications, all this thing Snap-on as a franchise of choice. This quarter, we were once again ranked among the top franchise organizations, both in the U.S. and abroad, recognized by the Franchise Business Review which in it's latest ranking for franchisee satisfaction, listed Snap-on as the top 50 franchise for the 15th consecutive year. We're also featured at number three among all franchises in Entrepreneurial Magazine's 2020 list of top franchises for veterans. And abroad, Snap-on was ranked number two in Elite Franchise Magazine's top U.K. franchises. The judges in that ranking state that the durability and innovation shown in the face of unimaginable circumstances are what is decided in this year's top 10 and the panel was right on. Durability and innovation are what makes the Tools Group -- what marks the Tools Group in the storm is clear. Now this type of recognition is a point of pride for us but it reflects the fundamental strength of our franchisees and of our van business in general but it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products developed through our strong customer connections, learning and leading to multiple new problem solving innovations. And the results of our insight in experience in the changing universe of vehicle repair. Customer connection gives us a great window on that changing universe and we put it to good use. Our sales of hand tools were up nicely in the quarter. And of course, new products led the way there. Our innovative 30, LS, DM, core half-inch drive impact sockets were a significant contributor. Born out of customer connection, observing the work in automotive shops, the special sockets, they range from to 17 to 22 millimeters, come with an extra deep hex, up to 3/4 inch deeper, accommodating the lug nuts with decorative caps that are becoming so common on the latest models. The new sockets provide the clearance needed to fit right over those nut covers without damage, grab the lug and enable quick removal without having to remove the caps. It saves techs significant time over a day of repair activity. They made right here in our Milwaukee plant. They released just this past quarter and initial sales have been gangbusters, I'm telling you. And making those sales have made that new socket line a hit product just in the volume in the fourth quarter. Accelerated sales. Well, that's the Tools Group, expanding the success in the U.S., balancing the international operations, continuing to innovate, building on our underlying advantages, stronger-than-ever performance all achieved against the wind. Now for RS&I volume for the fourth quarter was $392.5 million, up 8.7%, including acquisitions and 5.5% of organic growth with gains in sales of modern car equipment, increased volume of handheld diagnostics and the rise of information and data subscriptions being partially offset by a decrease in our business focused on vehicle OEMs and dealerships. RS&I operating margins of $97.2 million rose $7.2 million or 8% versus 2020. And that number in 2020 included $1 million of restructuring costs. Compared with the prepandemic levels of 2019, sales grew $57.5 million, 17.2%, including a $43.7 million or 13% organic gain. And the RS&I gross OI margin of 24.8% compared with a 24.9% and a 26% registered in 2020 and 2010, respectively, with the impact of acquisitions attenuating a generally positive balance for the operations. Again, software products and subscriptions for RS&I were a significant plus. Along those lines, I'll mention one division, providing software to independent shops, continue to succeed, pursuing customer connection and innovation, launching great new products to improve shop efficiency. RS&I just added more powerful and exclusive features to it's award-winning Mitchell 1 ProDemand auto repair information software. You see, as auto electronics have expanded, wiring diagrams have become of rising importance in vehicle diagnosis and repair. And the new ProDemand significantly advances what is already a clear lead from Mitchell 1 in diagram navigation, offering new features that provide interactive drop-downs, display connection data, allow easy movement to the next diagram on the diagnostic trail and enable a seamless recall of previous viewed circuits should a look-back be needed in the repair process. And as you might expect, the initial reactions to the new updates have been quite enthusiastic from both the shops and from the technicians. It's all music to our ears. We keep driving to expand RS&I's position with repair shop owners and managers, offering them more and more solutions for their day-to-day challenges, developed by our value creation processes or added by our strategic coherent acquisitions. And we're confident it's a winning formula. So those are the highlights of the quarter, doing what we expect to do, achieve ongoing process again -- achieve ongoing progress against the storm. A continuing rise versus the prepandemic levels, up more each quarter now for several straight periods. Gains forged through our Snap-on Value Creation processes, strengthening our business and driving to a 21% opco operating margin, up 90 basis points. A new record. EPS $4.10, a considerable rise to new heights, overcoming all headwinds and demonstrating continued confirmation that Snap-on has emerged from the pandemic much stronger than when we entered with the momentum that we're confident will propel us to even higher heights as we move forward. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the resilience and continued strength of our business model enabled Snap-on to close the year with another period of robust financial performance. The quarter also compared favorably with the fourth quarter of 2019 which being a pre-COVID-19 time period, in some cases, may serve to be the more meaningful baseline. Net sales of $1,108.3 million in the quarter increased 3.2% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 2.3% organic sales gain and a $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Additionally, net sales in the period increased 16% from $955.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, including a 13% organic gain, $20.9 million of acquisition-related sales and $7.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. In both comparisons, the organic gains more than offset lower sales for the military. Consolidated gross margin of 48.1% improved 10 basis points from 48% last year. The gross margin contributions from the higher sales volume, pricing actions, 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives offset higher material and other costs. For the quarter, the corporation continued to navigate effectively the supply chain dynamics associated with the global pandemic. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.1%, improved 80 basis points from 27.9% last year which included 10 basis points of cost from restructuring actions. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effect. Operating earnings before financial services of $232.2 million compared to $216.2 million in 2020 and $171.4 million in 2019, reflecting an improvement of 7.4% and 35.5%, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21% improved 90 basis points from last year and 310 basis points from 2019. The operating company margin of 21% represents the highest quarterly level of profitability in Snap-on's modern day history. Financial services revenue of $86.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to $93.4 million last year which included an extra week of interest income associated with the 53rd week 2020 fiscal calendar. Operating earnings of $67.2 million decreased $1.3 million from 2020 levels, reflecting the lower revenue, partially offset by lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $299.4 million increased 5.2% from $284.7 million last year and 28.2% from $233.6 million in 2019. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.1% compared to 24.4% in 2020 and 22.5% in 2019. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22.3% compared to 21.8% last year which includes a 10 basis point increase related to the restructuring actions. Net earnings of $223.7 million or $4.10 per diluted share increased $14.8 million or $0.28 per share from last year's levels, representing a 7.3% increase in diluted earnings per year. As compared to the fourth quarter 2019, net earnings increased $53.1 million or $1.02 per share, representing a 33.1% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $358.7 million decreased from $364.4 million last year, reflecting a $1.6 million organic sales decline and $4.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease primarily reflects a low single-digit decline in sales to customers in critical industries. Within critical industries, lower sales to the military were partially offset by gains in general industry and technical education as well as by improved sales into oil and gas applications. As a further comparison, net sales in the period increased 1.6% from 2016 levels, reflecting $8.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.8 million of favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by a $6.7 million organic sales decline. As compared to 2019, sales in our European-based hand tools business were up mid-teens. Those gains were more than offset by lower activity with the military. As you may recall, the fourth quarter of 2019 included sales for a major project that is substantially complete. Gross margin of 36.5% declined 130 basis points from 37.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily due to the higher material and other costs, partially offset by benefits from RCI initiatives. While pricing actions have been taken in this segment to help offset the increasing cost, the longer-term nature of certain customer agreements affects the timing of price realization. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.5% in the quarter compared to 22.4% last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $50.1 million compared to $56.2 million last year. The operating margin of 14% compared to 15.4% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $504.8 million increased 2% from $494.9 million in 2020, reflecting a 1.6% organic sales gain and $2 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a low single-digit gain in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our international operations. Net sales in the period increased 22.6% from $411.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, reflecting a 21.5% organic sales gain and $3.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Sales gains in the quarter were led by our hand tools category with strong performance sequentially as well as versus both the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019. Gross margin of 43.9% in the quarter improved 100 basis points from last year, primarily due to the higher sales volumes, pricing actions and 60 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects which offset higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22% improved from 24% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales and benefits from ongoing RCI and cost containment efforts. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $110.5 million compared to $93.6 million last year. The operating margin of 21.9% improved 300 basis points from 18.9% last year. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $392.5 million compared to $361.1 million a year ago, reflecting a 5.5% organic sales gain and $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $500,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of a double-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers, partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in sales to OEM dealerships. Also during the quarter, the RS&I Group continue to benefit from the increasing number of monthly software subscribers for it's aftermarket and dealership repair shops. As compared to 2019 levels, net sales increased $57.5 million from $335 million, reflecting a 13% organic sales gain, $12.2 million of acquisition-related sales and $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Gross margin of 46.1% was unchanged from last year as benefits from pricing actions and 60 basis points from acquisitions were offset by higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales was 21.3% compared to 21.2% last year, primarily dot [ph] to 150 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects, partially offset by the impact of higher sales and 30 basis points from lower expenses related to $1 million of restructuring costs that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $97.2 million compared to $90 million last year. The operating margin of 24.8% compared to 24.9% a year ago. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $86.9 million decreased $6.5 million from $93.4 million last year, primarily as a result of an additional week of interest income occurring in the 53rd 2020 fiscal year. Financial services operating earnings of $67.2 million compared to $68.5 million in 2020. Financial services expenses of $19.7 million were down $5.2 million from 2020 levels, primarily due to $5.6 million of decreased provisions for credit losses resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, including reduced year-over-year net charge-offs which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.9% and 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. In the fourth quarters of both 2021 and 2020, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7% and the average yield on contract receivables was 8.5%. Total loan originations of $256.3 million in the fourth quarter decreased $16.1 million or 5.9% from 2020 levels, reflecting a 3.6% decrease in originations of finance receivables and a 16.6% decrease in originations of contract receivables. Last year's extra week in the quarter contributed approximately $10 million of finance receivable originations. As a reminder, revenues in the quarter are generally dependent on the average size of the financing portfolio rather than originations in any one period. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit compared to 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2020. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points, reflecting the typical seasonal increase we experienced between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $41.1 million represented 2.38% of outstandings at quarter end, down 24 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $222.7 million in the quarter reflects 97.2% of net earnings and compared to $317.6 million the last year. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflects higher cash payments for income and other taxes, an $85 million increase in working investment, partially offset by higher net earnings. The change in working investment is largely driven by increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year versus a reduction of inventory in 2020. The increase in inventory primarily reflects higher demand as well as incremental buffer stocks and expanded levels of in-transit inventories associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $23.8 million included net additions to finance receivables of $9.7 million and $16.3 million of capital expenditures. Net cash used by financing activities of $154.1 million included cash dividends of $76.1 million and a repurchase of 355,000 shares of common stock for $75.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $454.9 million of common stock under existing authorizations. The 2021 full year free cash flow generation of $872.6 million represented about 104% of net earnings. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $41.6 million from 2020 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 58 days compared to 64 days at 2020 year-end. Inventories increased $57.3 million from 2020 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.8x compared to 2.4x at year-end 2020. Our year-end cash position of $780 million compared to $923.4 million at year-end 2020. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.1% compared to 12.1% at year-end 2020. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. So, I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. That's our fourth quarter. Positive performance, overcoming challenges as we expect to do. In these times of turbulence, we continue to rise based on the resilience of our markets, vehicle repair expanding at the shop level, tax pumped and garage is optimistic, overcoming the postponement of essential OEM programs. Critical industry is mixed but with promising areas, gains in general industry, natural resources and education and progress in emerging markets. Difficulties are in the air but we're able to prosper nonetheless on the power of our strategic position, controlling the customer interface with our wide product line and unique brand. And perhaps most importantly, we rose on the consistent and capable execution by our team, employing agile marketing, considered an active pricing, new and higher-value products, quick redesigns to match available materials, aggressive spot buying and as always, our ongoing RCI. It's a combination that offers another positive performance and has all spelled out clearly in our numbers. Sales rising organically over prepandemic levels by 13% with the last four periods, up organically 8%, 9%, 11% and 13%, expanding the gain over 2019, demonstrating a positive second derivative in the rising sales quarter-by-quarter. Opco OI margins of 21%, a record high in the midst of multiple challenges, up 90 basis points from last year and up substantially more from 2019. And it all came together for an EPS of $4.10, up 7.2% from last year and 33% from the prepandemic period, leading to a full year EPS of $14.92, new heights despite the storm. It was an encouraging quarter and a year. The period clearly had challenges but we were able to overcome maintaining our progress, extending our upward trend. And we believe that Snap-on exits 2021 with a substantial momentum that will carry us forward. And as we mine the abundant opportunities of our resilient markets, we held the advantages of our unique strategic position and engage the considerable capabilities of our challenged-tested team. We'll continue to track progress throughout 2022 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. Many of them are listening to this call. My friends, you are the base of the success we've registered this quarter and this year. For the extraordinary progress you achieved, you have my congratulations. For the unique individual and collective capabilities you brought to bear against the challenges, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you bring to our now and the conviction you hold in our future, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Stember with CL King. Scott Stember : Hi, good morning, guys and thanks for taking my questions. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Scott. Scott Stember : To better frame things out, obviously, as the comparisons are getting more difficult, can you maybe talk about, in the Tools Group, in the U.S., on a two year stack and maybe also sort of flush it out by tools and some of the other segments? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look, I think the Tools Group is demonstrating itself. I mean, if you look at the prepandemic levels, it's been up now six straight quarters and it was up over 21% in this quarter. I think it was 21.5%. So it seems to be moving upwards. And all of our good power -- in this time of turbulence, the Tools Group is really well positioned. When I say a strategic advantage of being -- with wide product line and unique brand to control the interface with the end customer, that's exactly what the Tools Group does in spades. It's able to price. It's able to bring value, new value products that don't look like price increases because people are paying for more features. And so that's a very strong position they have. Also, they can market agilely. So if you have supply chain problems, they can pitch their promotions to move people towards what we have a lot of and have a way somewhat from things we have less of. At the same time, they're working pretty well in the factories because they're vertically integrated. So you see their kind of numbers. The 21.9%, I think we were very encouraged by when we saw it. And so you see the Tools Group doing well in sales, in terms of profitability. And if you look back to 2019, what's happened is, I think I said before, is that we have figured out over the period, we were investing in SG&A in, say, like '18 and '19 to try to figure out how to expand the Tools Group's selling capability. And it seems to have worked. Our selling capability, our franchisees has gone up each quarter over that. You can see the expansion. The second derivative looks pretty good. So you're seeing that play out. What we're doing now is we're, of course, plumbing the ceiling of that, see how far it would take us. And we're investing and looking at other possibilities to keep that string going. We think -- we don't know how far those things we understood in terms of social media, in terms of being able to train more effectively will bring us but we're pretty optimistic about it. And I thought I was pretty clear about our views about momentum going forward in this period. If you look at RS&I, RS&I start to come back -- I mean, the thing it's had some good quarters but it's had some quarters where the margins were down. But this quarter, 23.8%, down 10 basis points and that's against multiple that get -- much more, like 80 or 90 basis points of acquisition impact. And what you see in RS&I is continuing positivity around the independent repair shops, particularly diagnostics and information products and the rise of subscriptions and software keeps ticking up because we keep emphasizing that, particularly things like the innovation you heard about Mitchell in terms of navigating the wiring diagrams and the car -- it deals those kind of situations. So you see that playing out. RS&I, I think they were up 5.5% organically in the quarter and up 13% versus -- last year and up 13% versus prepandemic levels, another very positive quarter. C&I is more vulnerable to the turbulence of the date because you have a lot of mixed markets. C&I is in a lot of sectors, a lot of countries. And in that cocktail, you see some countries that are down, particularly in Europe in this quarter which was difficult for you. And then C&I in some of the businesses, I did say, the customized toolkits, well, these customized toolkits are great. Just great margins on them but you have in those kits sometimes a couple of hundred tools. And the sourcing situation of today, when you're going to deliver those all, many of them from individual sources, you can get disruptive in terms of when you're going to be able to deliver and create some problems. And then on top of it for C&I, a big piece in the critical industry is the military business is pretty weak. We always -- we expect that to come back and we expect C&I to come forward. But we see Tools Group gangbusters. We see RS&I coming back, coming back from -- they've been -- they have been weak but they're getting better. They're heating up. You can see that number. And you see C&I kind of holding its own, kind of flat sales. But we figure as we get better at managing the situation, we have a challenged-tested team that does pretty well in this C&I is going to keep coming back. So we like our momentum going forward. Scott Stember : Got it. And just last question. This seems to be the first quarter that we've heard about or any quasi meaningful impact from supply chain. Can you maybe talk about that? And any further mitigation efforts that you guys could put through, whether it's RCI or anything else? Nick Pinchuk : Well, let me just say, though, I didn't say -- I said when I burrowed down on C&I, I mentioned supply chain. But our view of this is it's always something. It's always something. And if you look at our numbers, up, what, 15% -- 13% over prepandemic levels, 21% OI margin. I don't know if you look at the numbers, you can see any turbulence in those numbers. So I think we're managing through it. Yes, of course, it will get better as we go forward. I mean, it's hard for me to predict. But as you get into the moment, you get better at managing it. Right now, we're pretty good at agile marketing. We're good at managing or redesigning our products. We're good at spot buying. So we don't get it disruptive in general. We have certain modules of disruption that we'll figure out and we'll solve but you don't really get that kind of problem going forward. Now some of our businesses like, for example, you could look at tool storage. We could sell more tool storage if we could turn some more out and we're working on that. So you may see some of that going forward. But I don't accept the idea that we're being impacted by this. We're dealing with it. I think the number is saying, that was a good quarter whether we thought we had turbulence or not. Scott Stember : Got it. Thanks for the color. That's all I had. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Aldo Pagliari : Good morning, Bret. Bret Jordan : You called out, I guess, some of the pricing contracts in C&I as obviously, costs of everything have gone up versus the prices you received. Could you talk maybe about the magnitude and the timing of some of the pricing resets that you have going forward? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. I don't -- they're all over the map in terms of that situation and they're by segment. But look, C&I is -- I just -- our point there was C&I is a longer wave business. So you have commitments with some customers, not all customers, so you see some impact on that and you price associated with that. We're getting some pricing in C&I, some but not as much as not other things. Our big thing isn't so much about pricing. It's managing those costs. And so the idea of C&I, I think our disruption is mostly associated with what I pointed out in terms of the custom kitting situation, trying to deliver those things. That's been more probably the biggest impact on this, attenuating some of their volumes, particularly in critical industries. Bret Jordan : Okay. great. And then within the OE business, was there any improvement in cadence as we got through the quarter? Obviously, some of the OEs on the auto side are talking about some improvement in supply chain but did you see any change in their buying patterns as the quarter progressed? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, I'd be kidding. Their fourth quarter was terrible, wasn't it? I thought the fourth quarter for those guys was brutal. So we didn't see much -- if we're talking about projects, we didn't see much cadence difference. I mean, actually, there's a lot of new models coming out that are going to come out new features and I don't think we saw any cadence change in the quarter. Now I'm on shaky ground a little bit about saying that there might have been some of it but I -- my macro view of it, Bret, is it was a tough quarter for the auto companies. So I think as we go forward, it's got to get better. They're going to shake loose some of those. And so we're going to get -- because we're already involved in some of those products, we're just waiting for them to come out. That's what I see. I think the -- if you look at the dealerships, if you go -- like I thought I'd try to make clear, at the dealerships level, the repair is great at that situation. So we're seeing dealerships buy equipment. And one of the upticks in we didn't -- I don't think I mentioned it here but one of the upticks in the RS&I business, it's a rise -- a nice rise in repair shop undercar equipment. Collision and the balances and changes and those kinds of things. And so that's been going up. Also, they're buying software from us. So that's pretty good in that situation. But if you're talking about the programs out of the OEM, your guess is as good as mine when that breaks loose. All we know is they've got a backlog in there that's going to be good for us when it breaks. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. And then one final question. I guess you called out hand tools as strong in the Tools Group a couple of times. Did you say what the spread was sort of hand tools relative to storage and diagnostics? Nick Pinchuk : I did not. Bret Jordan : Why did not? Nick Pinchuk : And the reason is I want to get away from talking about the numbers by product line in the Tools Group. To us, it doesn't matter. We skin the cat many ways. So the point about the Tools Group is 21.9% margin. Now hand tools were a nice piece of that. But I will tell you the big ticket items were also up in that period. Tool storage and diagnostics were up. The hand tools are sort of the flavor of the day -- these days because, of course, we're more vertically integrated. Fundamentally, when the hand tool comes in the door, all we add is steel, capital and labor, boom. So it was -- but it's been strong for a number of different periods. So, I don't really want to get down that road. Just saying hand tools was a nice product. Nice -- but as was diagnostics in the period and we had increases in tool storage as well. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Great. Operator : We'll take our next question from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. First question, Nick, I wanted to ask a follow-up on something that you mentioned a couple callers ago and that's regarding the investment spending past year as we begin '22 or maybe even more broadly as we go through the next few years at this stage of the cycle, you've been steadfast about maintaining the rate of investment in the Tools Group, in particular and you referenced plumbing to death of these capacity creation initiatives from here. Just wondering if you're able to talk about any new focus areas, or within the capacity creation initiatives where we might see the company push a little incrementally in '22? Nick Pinchuk : Look, I think this, we have -- of course, we're taking a look at where -- how we source and where we need more capacity in the factories and those kinds of things. But I don't see it there -- I don't see it distorting our financials in that regard. I think a couple of things. When I said that I didn't mean that the OE was going to explode or anything like that. Fundamentally, our OE was higher before because we were spending a lot of effort and a lot of different corridors trying to figure out what would actually resonate with the Tools Group and make a difference. Our OE is in a nice place now. And of course, as you come out, you know how you say this, you're kind of loosening your belt a little bit when you've had a downtick in the COVID but I think our OE is at a nice level. It may go up a little bit but not that much. We're not going to -- but the areas where we're going to spend, I think, would be -- we're going to push more on social media because we've learned more about that. Boy, you know what, we've got a lot of data on our franchisees. We get the franchisees and our customers. We got oodles of data and we could do a better job in terms of predictive behavior on those things. So we're spending time looking at that right now. I don't have anything to report other than, boy, it's obvious to us we have Mitchell-type SureTrack data which we have about cars. We have that about our customers. And so we think we'll be able to wheel that to make the Tools Group even more effective. So our guys can make better choices when they engage customers. That's probably another area we're looking at right now. Luke Junk : Okay. And then I want to ask a bigger picture question as a follow-up. Thank you for that. Dealer FX were, I think, approaching the one year anniversary of that acquisition. I don't know if you could to progress in year one under the company's ownership? And looking forward, more importantly, should we expect to hear more about this business in the future as a complementary software platform sitting alongside Mitchell 1 in that dealership environment? Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. I mean, look, I think that's why we bought it for two reasons. One, from a financial point of view, it is a twin of Mitchell 1. And I don't know if you're familiar with Mitchell 1 but if you pay -- I know you are, we've been paying -- we've been talking about the growth of our diagnostics and software in independent repair shops almost every quarter since I've been here. They just keep going upward. Boom, boom, boom. And so Mitchell 1 knows how to handle that interface. And so we're using that knowledge that, I would say, challenged-tested understanding of the business to apply to Dealer FX and in the fullness of time, that's going to work it's magic there. We believe we'll have a kind of a twin. I'm not saying it's going to be as great as Mitchell 1, it may be but it's going to be a good business. So you're going to see it from a financial point of view but it's also important from us strategically because as you know, it has a window on what happens with these new technologies and the new technology is going to be the drivers of the future and it's going to call it -- help us call in the airstrikes for what product we develop because we're going to see it first in Dealer FX. So you're going to hear us talking about that. But these are early days. It's the first year. There's a lot of turbulence, these kinds of things. In terms of Canada, I think Justin Trudeau just got the COVID himself. So this impacts the activity in Canada. But I believe certainly Dealer FX was up in the quarter and we're making -- we're sort of making our expectations in this but you'll hear more of it as we go forward because it's going to be a big factor on us in terms of early warning. Also, financially. Luke Junk : Great. Well, yes, I appreciate that it's still early days there. That's great color and I'll leave it there. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Sure. Operator : We'll take our next question from Liz Suzuki with Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki : So this one is for Aldo. I guess could you just talk about the inflation impact that you expect through the course of the year and how the cadence of that could work out with the dynamic of cost and price and how that would impact the P&L? Aldo Pagliari : Well, certainly, of course, everybody is talking more about inflation than in the past and Snap-on is not immune from that. However, Liz, I think it is something we manage and strive. First, we always look for alternative ways to reduce cost, whether that be alternative sourcing, alternative componentry, rapid continuous improvement to get some productivity. And of course, if we can't cover that, then we look for pricing actions to help us out. We do believe we have pricing power personified by the Tools Group. And then as Nick already has said, we get pricing over time in the commercial industrial group and repair systems and information in light of the fact that they have longer-term customer agreements. So, we don't immediately just put pen to paper and say, oh, it's got to be this pricing. We try and strive to see what we can offset internally. At the same time, we're cognizant of the new features we always bring to market. So rather than bring a price increase to market, our preference is, can we bring a higher featured product to market and talk more about that feature, even though it might cost more to the customer. We try to create that vision as there's more productivity being brought to market. So that's kind of our broad-based approach. So yes, there's more inflation but we'll continue to try to bring more innovation and more value add for the customer. Nick Pinchuk : Now to put in perspective, Liz, just I'd add on that, if you just look at our hit products, we bring couple of three dozen new products every quarter to the market. So that's a big factor for us. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great. And I guess second question is just on priorities for capital. I mean, your net debt-to-capital ratio came down about three percentage points since last year. It's at a historically low level. What are you thinking about for this upcoming year and beyond in terms of where your priorities lie? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look, I think our priorities are still in line. I think, we believe, the best return on capital for our people -- for our investors and for constituents is investing in our business. So to the extent we can invest it in business in some of these new activities or anything like that, we will. We support that. Secondly, we have a pretty full, I would say, pipeline of acquisitions that we keep looking at. And I kind of think, call me crazy but I think in the turbulence, the acquisitions may be more available in this situation. So we're kind of hoping that -- we're kind of focused on a few things that may have some ability to move. And we're not afraid to take big ones or small ones in that situation. And then we have -- our Board just reloaded our share buyback situation and I think now another $500 million. And we have our dividend which we look at and we're kind of -- I think it's been kind of a front piece for Snap-on where we have paid a dividend every quarter for -- since 1939 and we've never reduced it. So we hold it in perpetuity in terms of our policy. And we always look to see if it's appropriate to upgrade it. So those are the kinds of things we're looking at. I think every year changes and this year, it's marked by the idea there's a lot of turbulence out there, maybe there's some opportunities for us. Elizabeth Suzuki : Great, thank you. It's very helpful. Operator : And we'll go to our next question from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Hi, good morning, everyone. Nick, it's encouraging to hear you leaning a little more into the data analytics. So I think that has the potential to move the needle. So congratulations on that initiative. I guess to start off with, what do you think sales of the truck were up year-over-year? Nick Pinchuk : I think about the same. I think roughly the same as the Tools Group, I would say, in the same ballpark. In fact, if you look over -- David, if you look over two years' worth, there's differences from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look back over two years, they've been about the same, like we generally see and this quarter was the same kind of thing. There's a little bit of noise with the 53rd week and the franchisees probably doing a little more than they would order from us. But I think generally, it's roughly the same. They're in practically lockstep. So we see the inventory kind of on the Tools Group holding pretty flat. David MacGregor : Got it. And then just still on the Tools Group, you talked about the 300 basis points of operating margin improvement. About 200 basis points of that came out of SG&A and 60 basis points was FX. So clearly, it feels like the price cost pressures that everybody else in the world seems to be feeling are coming home to roost at Snap-on as well. Go ahead. Nick Pinchuk : We make -- holding gross margins are -- is a common occurrence in this environment. David MacGregor : Well, I'm just trying to get a kind of -- I'm just trying to get it to kind of the price cost pressure. Nick Pinchuk : It's like this though. I think, look, I think yes, we have pressures on a lot of different things. There's a lot of things that go in that gross margin and there are a lot of things that go in the SG&A. I think our view was on the OI margin in general, the up to 300 basis points. We -- I think I've said this on other calls long ago that we're kind of agnostic between those two numbers. We kind of focus on the OI margin, up 300 basis points, not bad. Now you could say, okay, well, the gross margin is up less than the OE. But if you look back to prepandemic levels, they're both up reasonably well. I think, 100 basis points and 200 basis points. And I don't think that's chop-liver in this environment. Yes, there are pressures associated with the supply and sourcing but we're able to manage it such that we don't give up anything. David MacGregor : So, I guess my question on this is really just as you look forward to 2022, Nick, you talked about is the opportunity to -- Aldo referenced the opportunity to raise pricing within the tools segment but also to bring kind of better margin products and better incremental margin products to the marketplace and cover your cost that way or cost and productivity that way. Can you give us a sense of how you're thinking about the split between those two opportunities? Do you think you'll be leaning a little more on to the pricing side and then supplementing that with a better margin product? Or are you leaning a little more towards a better margin product and supplementing that with pricing? Nick Pinchuk : Well, generally, I think if it's the latter, I think that we would rather have it with our new products and then be foolish around those. I think it isn't a ball-based. I mean, fundamentally, I just want to come back to your original question. It would be a mistake to think that the costs weren't coursing through our numbers this quarter because they are. And so we have those and we're holding our own against those with pricing and with those -- like I said, people -- I think sometimes people don't realize how many new products we bring out. If you just look at the hit products and they're the ones that are the incandescent ones, $1 million in the first year, we have two to three dozen every quarter. And so we have a lot of opportunity in both those areas. And I think that's what allows us to maintain this. And our -- this ain't our first rodeo. So we know how to manage this. I think our team -- not me. I'm just a trained dog at the top of the [indiscernible]. But the thing is the guys know how to manage this such they can bring with the combination of direct pricing plus promotions plus the new products. They can manage that interface very well. That's what I meant about the strategic position. So we're not hanging our hands at all, David. David MacGregor : Great. Okay. I guess I wanted to also ask about the originations down, 6%. Are you -- and I noticed the yield is coming down a little bit on the portfolio as well. Are you just seeing changes in patterns in terms of how new techs are using credit? Or how much of this is maybe just substitution of RA credit. You're just losing share to your franchisees on the credit front. Or -- and how much it might just be alternative sources of credit as some others have talked about? Nick Pinchuk : I don't think -- I was just with the franchisees at the kickoff in Omaha. I got to go to Omaha. I'll go back to Orlando. You can figure that one out in January. But I was with the group. Our franchisees don't think we're losing any share to other alternative sources. They just think, look, these guys are flushed; so they're willing to pay. I mean, if you look at the numbers, the BLS data says that investment in repair, up double digits on a year-over-year basis in both nominal and real basis and the technician wages are up over 5% year-over-year. And the number of technicians out there are growing. So I think you see this kind of a growing flush group of people and they're not -- they're staying with RA. They don't want to pay the interest. We think it's great because fundamentally, the guys have debt capacity available when they need it. The other factor is, I think, in this is that I never wanted to say this. I said it wouldn't last time. But if you look at the 53rd week last year, generally, our stuff cuts off. But even if the franchisees go out for a day or two or three, they're going to generate more year-over-year originations because it happens in the field at some point. I don't know how much that accounts for but you can knock down some of that. So I don't think that's an unusual situation. David MacGregor : And then the credit origination is down 16.6. What -- can you talk a little bit about what might have been happening there? Aldo Pagliari : Well, Aldo -- I'd say if you take into account $10 million that I mentioned that, that extra week allowed, we would have probably been up slightly, I'd say, in the U.S. environment. Down a little bit international. International is not quite as robust as the U.S. I think we mentioned that as well that we were up in the U.S. in terms of our sales versus international. And then, if you look at the -- even the contract originations, in 2020, we had more new start-ups. There's a little bit more stable environment now with the franchisees. So there was less startups in the international arena in particular. And when you start up franchise, David, many of the franchisees tend to like the lease vans and borrow from Snap-on credit; so that could affect it. So, it's really -- I don't want to dismiss it. And I always try to remind people that you're still not in a completely certain environment that we find over the time of history that people tend to buy lower price point items until certainty restores. So I don't think tool storage has been as robust as you see in the revolving credit accounts and therefore, you see more revolving action on the [indiscernible]. David MacGregor : That makes sense. Last question for me is just with respect to the share repurchase activity and you talked about the fact that you just had another authorization from the Board. But activity in the fourth quarter really didn't change much year-over-year, roughly in that $70-odd million. A good number for the full year, by the way. So good activity there. But how do we think about share repurchase here? And why wouldn't you step up and just get a lot more aggressive here in terms of buying back your stock at these levels? Aldo Pagliari : Well, we always think of things like that. But if you look at the funnel of time, it averages between 2% and 3% of the outstanding share count, more or less. And it's hard to be an expert in this market. I have no idea if the advertising revenues of Facebook will impact Snap-on the next day when I get up and things of that nature and I'm being extreme of that example. But we try to take a measured approach to it. It has it's role. It's not the only solution in terms of how to use cash. David MacGregor : Okay, great. Thanks very much, gentlemen. Aldo Pagliari : Welcome, David. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Verbsky, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks Sara. Good morning everybody. As usual, I'll start the call by covering the highlights of our first quarter and along the way, I'll give you my perspective on our results, they are encouraging. In our market, so looking positive and our progress, we believe we're stronger than ever. We'll also speak about what it all means. We believe it means that we're positioned for more, much more. Then Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. These are interesting times, filled with multiple axes of turbulence, but this isn't our first rodeo. We know it's always something. And it's our job to confront and to overcome with the resilience of our markets, the strength of our strategic and tactical advantages and the insight and energy of our consistent and capable team, and we've done just that. Here are the numbers that support that view. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.0978 billion were up 7.1%, including $8.5 million in acquisition-related activity of $15.7 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 8% with gains in every group. And compared to the pre-pandemic levels in 2019, our clear upward drive shines right through versus 2019 sales in this past quarter rose 19.1% as reported and 16.9% organically. In fact, it's our seventh straight quarter being above the pre-virus levels. We believe we're continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion, momentum, increasing higher and higher, demonstrating that we're only getting stronger every day. And contributions from our Snap-on Value Creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation, and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, all combined to drive that progress, and progress there was. Opco operating income of $223.1 million increased $22.2 million from last year. The operating margin, it was 20.3%, up 70 basis points from last year and 120 basis points from 2019, as adjusted for the favorable legal settlement in that period. For financial services, operating income of $70.4 million increased 7.8% and credit losses were down, continuing the positive trends, despite the lingering effects of the pandemic. And that result combined with opco for a consolidated operating margin of 24.8%, a 90 basis improvement from last year and 120 basis points from the as adjusted 2019 result. First quarter EPS, it was $4, up 14.3% from last year's $3.50 and 32.9% above the as-adjusted $3.01 recorded in 2019. To risk repeating myself, we believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering and our first quarter results are solid testimony. Now let's talk about our markets. Auto repair remains quite resilient. I think, we'd say, spending on vehicle maintenance and repair is up and technicians are earning more than ever. They've been working, performing essential tasks, making a nice living. They're undaunted by the turbulence and they are optimistic about the future of their profession, about the outlook of individual transportation, and about the greater need for their skills as the vehicle part changes with new technology and all of that has led to an expansion in the ranks with the automotive repair technician count moving upward at its highest point for, I think, at least three decades. And as shopowners and managers will tell you, there's a need for many more. Vehicle repair strong -- is a strong and resilient market. You can hear it in our franchisees voices. You could feel it in a technician's wallet, and you can see it written across our numbers. Also in an auto repair, spanning right next to the tax, there are shop owners and managers, where our Repair Systems & Information Group, RS&I applies its trade. Demand for new and used cars is high, despite the limited supply, despite the limited supply. Dealership repair, maintenance and warranty is rebounding, and dealers are starting to invest again. New vehicles are being released with a greater variety of drivetrains, with a greater variety of drivetrains than ever, from internal combustion engines, from internal combustion to hybrid to plug-in electric, to full electric, and the range of options is growing, more driver assist, more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity. To tell you, it's all music to our ears. And we've been able to take advantage with our lineup of intelligent diagnostic products, by including the ZEUS, the TRITON and the APOLLO handheld units, with our celebrated Mitchell1 ProDemand repair information, our award-winning Tru-Point Advanced Driver Assist calibration system, and our 3D alignment systems like the new Hofmann Geoliner, all representing new technologies and big data deployed to make work easier right in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-on is poised to capitalize. Finally, let's talk about critical industries. With Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tests of consequence. This is where C&I operates, the most international of our operations. And these are the customers that continue to be impacted hardest by the lingering virus, but they removed -- they've been recovering. And in the quarter, our results showed that trend. Despite some significant headwinds like supply chain disruption, commodity cost increases, some challenged business sectors like the military and international \u2013 international aviation or aerospace, and troubled geographies, conflict impacted countries and those more prone to business interruptions as a means to control the virus. Well, C&I had it all.  Despite the variation, though, we did see growth, improvement in a number of geographies, Asia and Europe and in a range of sectors like general industry, education and natural resources. They all combined to author organic growth against the continuing turbulence. So overall, I'd describe our C&I markets as challenged, but improving.  And looking forward, we believe they represent clear opportunity. Viewing on the overall picture, we believe there's been substantial progress along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending to critical industries and building in emerging markets, leveraging our broadening product lines, wielding our strong brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of Snap-On people, even in the throes of the pandemic shock.  Two years ago, as we entered the virus, you all remember this, two years ago when we entered the virus, we recognized the resilience of our market and the strength of our model and projected a V-shaped recovery and that's how it played out. You can see it in the trends.  Now let's turn to the segments. In the C&I Group, first quarter sales were $340.1 million, down $5.6 million due to $9.2 million of unfavorable currency, and $3.6 million or 1.1% -- and a $3.6 million or 1.1% organic growth. As we said, across C&I, results were mixed. But the period did see gains in Asia with Japan, India, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, rising. And Europe was also up, with Sweden, Belgium, Poland and France leading the way.  C&I's operating income was $45.7 million, down $5 million, reflecting $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency, with the organic volume gains more than offset by supply chain inefficiencies. Now when compared with the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, sales were up 5.5%, including a 3.6% organic gain and the OI margin of 13.4% was down 100 basis points, but against 150 basis points impact of acquisitions and unfavorable currency. C&I has simply been more affected by the difficulties, macroeconomic challenges, geopolitical uncertainty, varying COVID conditions. It makes sense. But the operation is spread over more countries and more industries. It's challenging, but we are making some headway and we're enthusiastic about the possibilities going forward. As part of that view, we remain committed to extending in Critical Industries, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture opportunities as they arise and enabling that attempt is our expanding line of innovative new products, designed to match the demands of the industries, industries that we serve and to make critical work easier. One example is our family of microelectronic torque wrenches. And I've been talking about Snap-On electronic torque products for some time. But these smaller versions of our flagship offerings are gaining particular strength in the critical markets. Our latest, the connected Bluetooth model offers customers a solution when they need torque certification data in real time. The Snap-On Control Tech Micro Bluetooth wrench fills that requirement and combines it with the benefits of reduced size and lower weight, shorter than 12 inches and less than one pound, better accessibility and reduced operator fatigue, all while allowing users to interface with a Snap-on app or directly with customers with the customer's operating system. The ControlTech Micro Bluetooth offers a wide range of torque, five to 240 inch pounds, an all steel body construction, progressive LEDs for an enhanced user guidance and a 72-inch quarter-inch drive enabling efficient operation in tight areas, all with a plus or minus 2% accuracy. It's a package well-suited to critical sectors like aviation. And in the first quarter, our customers' orders confirmed that belief emphatically. Well, that's C&I. Hard one progress against the turbulence. Now on to the Tools Group. Sales of $512.1 million, up $33.8 million, including $3 million of unfavorable currency, and $36.8 million or 7.7% organic gain, double digit growth in the U.S. being partially offset by challenges in the international operations. The operating margin was 22.7%, up 200 basis points from last year's historically high level -- high 20.7%. And compared with the pre-virus levels, sales grew 24.8%, and this year's 22.7% operating margin was up 630 basis points compared with 2019. The Tools Group is -- the Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, taking advantage of increasing vehicle complexity, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands, and further enabling its franchisees and the results show it. I keep saying that, but that's what's written across our performance this quarter. We do believe our runway for coherent growth, enhancing the franchise network, represents a resilient and expanding opportunity. And we're realizing some of that potential across the van channel. The evidence is unmistakable in our franchisee metrics. Again, this quarter, they remain clearly favorable. And based on those measurements, we believe the franchisees have never been stronger, and they say so themselves emphatically, pumped in time for more that's what they are. And in our direct interactions at events like the past January's kickoff, back again this year in person. It was a great affair, well-attended, strong orders, visible commitment to our brand. Our franchisees, entrepreneurs and professionals all are enabled by their increased selling capabilities, broadly and deeply confident in their prospects, in the company's prospects and eager to reach higher. That's an important factor. And there's a number of reasons for that optimism, but a big one is rooted in Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, authoring new products, clearly making work easier, born out of observing changing work in shops on an everyday basis, just like the franchisees. And that's the reason our tool storage sales were up nicely in the quarter, driven in part by our -- they were driven in part by our exciting new line of mobile carts. Over the last several years, we've been enhancing our carts. One example is our KRSC range of mobile storage solutions, the only professional grade carts in the market, they're built in our Iowa plant. I just saw them running down, I was just there seeing those units roll down the line. The KRSC are designed for maximum strength and durability. They're constructed with a heavy gauge steel, to form a one piece, fully welded body with reinforced corners, and that's a significant and unique benefit in the mobile storage arena. These 30 parts make it easy to move even the heaviest tools from bay-to-bay. They come in an attractive range of colors and trims, just like they are full-sized Big Brother boxes. And they're offered in either a sliding split top, providing usable work surface, while allowing substantial access to the top drawer or a single piece flip flop, allowing quicker and broader access to the most frequently used tools. Our new cart also has -- also features full wide drawers for maximum flexibility and offer power options for charging cordless tools. The KRSC -- the KRSC, you can to say it in these three words, durability, versatility, and functionality. They're great for meeting -- they're great for newer mechanics, as an affordable way to own some serious Snap-on tool storage. And at the same time, they're attractive for veterans. They're attractive for veterans, giving them the opportunity to improve productivity by expanding their mobility around the shop. This quarter, as repair work and tech wages are on the rise, we received record orders, proving that when innovation meets a resilient market, demand follows. We said that vehicle repair was growing was growing, and it is. Complexity would accelerate the market upward and it has. And we're working hard to position our franchisees to take advantage. And you can see it in the Tools Group results, seven straight above pre-pandemic gangbuster's quarters. Now, let's speak of RS&I. First quarter sales rose 50.6% or -- $50.6 million or 14.6% with gains across the board. Organic growth was 13.3%, driven by undercar equipment and OEM dealership activity, delivering double-digit expansion. And by the diagnostics and information products, the independent shops advancing low single-digits. Compared with 2019 sales -- compared with 2019, sales grew $70.3 million, 21.4%, including 56.9% -- including $56.9 million or 17.4% organic gain, $15.2 million from acquisitions and $1.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Operating earnings of 91.6% increased $10.2 million from 2021 and the OI margin was 23%, down 40 basis points, but primarily due to acquisitions and the rise of lower-margin undercar equipment. We clearly see the potential of our runways for growth in the RS&I Group, expanding Snap-on's presence in the garage, which coherent acquisitions and a growing line of powerful products. The organic growth in the quarter was broad-based, but once again, undercar equipment expanded at double-digits and progress in one of our newest product groups, collision repair helped author that positive. And we're doubling down on the potential in that arena by utilizing the same broad database with deep content as used in our ProDemand vehicle repair solutions. Big data aimed specifically at the body shop, vehicle measurements to guide body work, repair information to aid in standard shop work, and calibrations to restore the sensor networks that support ADAS or advanced driver assistance systems. It's a combination that's increasingly essential for every collision shop. And we believe it is going to be a big seller. RS&I also got a nice boost from winning a number of significant essential tools and equipment programs for OEM dealerships. As we expected, we started to see new launches for both electric power and for internal combustion vehicles, and RS&I is right at the front. So we're quite positive about RS&I's expanding position with vehicle repair shop owners and managers and are very confident in the opportunities as the vehicle industry evolves. So that's the highlights of our quarter. Progress in the turbulence. C&I, growing despite the headwinds. The Tools Group, strong and confident. RS&I solid. Overall organic sales rising 8%. Opco operating margin, 20.3% and EPS $4, up significantly. And most importantly, more testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the turbulence much stronger than when it entered. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $197.8 million in the quarter increased 7.1% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8% organic sales gain, an $8.5 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $15.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter principally reflected double-digit growth in the Repair Systems & Information Group, and high single-digit growth in the Snap-on Tools Group. Consolidated gross margin of 48.7% declined 140 basis points from 50.1% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the higher sales volumes, pricing actions, benefits from the company's RCI initiatives and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. In the quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continued to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 28.4% improved 210 basis points from 30.5% last year. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, savings from RCI initiatives and lower costs associated with stock-based expenses. These improvements were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings before financial services of $223.1 million in the quarter compared to $200.9 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.3%, improved 70 basis points from last year. Financial services revenue of $87.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to $88.6 million last year. Operating earnings of $70.4 million increased $5.1 million from 2021 levels, primarily reflecting continued favorable portfolio performance, which resulted in lower provisions for credit losses. Consolidated operating earnings of $293.5 million compared to $266.2 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.8% improved 90 basis points from 23.9% in 2021. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 23.7% compared to 23.5% last year. Net earnings of $217.4 million or $4 per diluted share, increased $24.8 million or $0.50 per share from last year's levels, representing a 14.3% increase in diluted earnings per share.  Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $340.1 million decreased from $345.7 million last year, reflecting a $3.6 million or 1.1% organic sales gain, which was more than offset by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects a double-digit increase in sales in the segment's Asia Pacific operations, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales to customers in Critical Industries. Within Critical Industries, lower sales to the military more than offset solid gains in general industry and technical education. Gross margin of 36.4% declined 230 basis points from 38.7% in the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to the higher material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and the segment's RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23% in the quarter improved 100 basis points from 24% in 2021, primarily reflecting savings from cost efficiencies. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $45.7 million compared to $50.7 million last year. The operating margin of 13.4% compared to 14.7% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-On Tools Group of $512.1 million increased 7.1% from $478.3 million in 2021 reflecting a 7.7% organic sales gain, partially offset by $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase reflects a double-digit gain in our US business, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in our international operations.  Sales in the United States were up over Q4, 2021 as well, reflecting strong sequential performance in power tools and tool storage. Gross margin of 45.5% in the quarter declined 40 basis points from last year, primarily due to higher material and other costs, which were more \u2013 mostly offset by the higher sales volumes, pricing actions and 30 basis points from favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.8% improved 240 basis points from 25.2% last year, primarily reflecting the higher sales, savings from RCI initiatives and lower stock-based expenses related to the company's franchisee stock plan. Operating earnings for the Snap-On Tools Group of $116 million compared to $98.9 million last year. The operating margin of 22.7% improved 200 basis points from 20.7% last year. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $398.2 million compared to $347.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 13.3% organic sales gain and $8.5 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar equipment and in sales to OEM dealerships, as well as low single-digit gains in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers.  Gross margin of 44.6% declined 140 basis points from 46% last year. This was primarily due to increased sales in lower gross margin businesses and higher material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and 50 basis points from acquisitions, as well as from 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.6% improved 100 basis points from 22.6% last year, primarily due to the benefits from sales volume leverage, including higher volumes and lower expense businesses, and savings from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 110 basis points of unfavorable acquisition effects. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $91.6 million, compared to $81.4 million last year. The operating margin of 23% compared to 23.4% a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $87.7 million decreased $900,000 from $88.6 million last year, primarily due to a decline in the size of the average financial services portfolio during the quarter as compared to last year. Financial services operating earnings of $70.4 million, compared to $65.3 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $17.3 million were down $6 million from 2021 levels, primarily due to $5.6 million of decreased provisions for credit losses, resulting from favorable loan portfolio trends, including reduced year-over-year net charge-offs, which support lower forward-looking estimated reserve requirements. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.8% and 1.1% in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.6% in both years, while the average yield on contract receivables was 8.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Total loan originations of $245.6 million in the first quarter decreased $16.2 million or 6.2% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 5.1% decrease in origination to finance receivables and 11.5% decrease in originations of contract receivables. In the United States, finance receivable or extended credit originations were down low single digits. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our US operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for US extended credit remained the same as both the fourth quarter of 2021 and as in the first quarter of 2021. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $39.9 million represented 2.34% of outstandings at quarter end, down 21 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $193.9 million in the quarter compared to $319.3 million last year. The decrease from the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a $106.7 million increase in working investment and higher payments for variable compensation, partially offset by increased net earnings. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, resulting in increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year as compared to a reduction of inventory in 2021. In addition to demand-based requirements, the increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Inventory turns at the end of the first quarter of 2022 are unchanged sequentially. Net cash used by investing activities of $6.6 million included $20.2 million of capital expenditures and net collections of finance receivables of $10.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $106.3 million included cash dividends of $75.7 million and repurchase of 136,000 shares of common stock for $28.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $442.2 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $49 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end. Inventories increased $60.3 million for 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.8% were the same as year-end 2021 and compared to 2.6% at the end of the first quarter in 2021. Our quarter end cash position of $861.1 million compared to $270 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 7.4% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to the US tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our first quarter. At some level, we could summarize the environment by these are interesting times and the hits they just keep on coming. But despite the challenges, the quarters are pretty much playing out as we said they would. The Snap-on team is prevailing against multiple axes of turbulence. Our markets are resilient, with their essential nature shining through, repair spending is up, tech numbers growing, wages rising, and the increasing complexity, electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids, improved internal combustion power plants and ADAS, it's all driving demand. And our continuing investments in product and brand and people, all through the pandemic is paying off. Our franchisees are selling more effectively and are prospering. And we've come out of this great withering stronger than when we entered. C&I, seeing the most turbulence, borne out of the multiple geographies, a range of industries and a wide product footprint, serious challenges, but still progressed, up 1.1% organically in the quarter. The Tools Group, prospering. Sales up 7.7% versus last year, rising 24.1% over 2019. OI margin, 22.7%, up 200 basis points from last year. RS&I, 13.3% growth, OI margin, 23%, down 40 basis points, but more than explained by acquisitions and business mix, the credit company, profits up, losses down, and it all came together for an overall organic growth of 8%. And opco OI margins of 20.3%, up 70 basis points year-over-year and rising 120 basis points compared with before the \u2013 before the pandemic as adjusted and an EPS of $4, up versus every comparison. It was an encouraging quarter. We have momentum. And looking forward, we are optimistic and confident. Confident in the special resilience and potential of our markets, confident in the power of our strategic and tactical advantages, and confident in the capability of our people and experienced team that sees progress against turbulence as fundamental to their expectations. And we believe that unique combination \u2013 that unique combination, turbulence tested, will propel us to -- to a consistent and ongoing positive trend throughout 2022, and well beyond that. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates, many of you I know are listening. When we say we are encouraged, optimistic and confident, it's deeply rooted in your extraordinary capability and energy. For the part you've played in our success, you have my congratulations. For the skills you bring to our enterprise, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you unfailingly display to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll move to our first question comes from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. Gary, your line is open. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning, everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Gary. Gary Prestopino : Nick, could I just get \u2013 or from Aldo, a couple of \u2013 I couldn\u2019t write down fast enough on both the C&I and the RS&I business, what was the growth in organic sales versus Q1 2019 pre-pandemic levels? Nick Pinchuk : For C&I, it was 3.6% and I think in RS& I, I believe, 17.4%. Aldo Pagliari : Yeah. 17.4%, absolutely right. Nick Pinchuk : Thank you. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Could you maybe just talk about how the cadence of your business trended in \u2013 on Continental Europe and the UK throughout the quarter? Did it start off strong and start to wane, because of the impacts of what was going on in Ukraine and the Russia sanctions? Nick Pinchuk : No. Look, I don't think the Ukraine reached that far for us. We didn't see the conflict in Eastern Europe reaching that far. UK was soft in this quarter, pretty much a lot of different places. And what we see happening, I think, is our opinion is, the problems or the turbulence associated with the Brexit problems weren't solved during the pandemic, and they're starting to emerge a little bit more in that place. So I don't know. We don't really see that. It was pretty much off throughout the quarter. And it was down. I think it was kind of weaker last quarter too. I think the international business had some issues last quarter, particularly in the Tools Group. So that \u2013 we really didn't see any, I would say, landscaping by calendarization in this quarter. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then a couple of more questions here. On \u2013 in the Tools Group itself or really across all of your automotive-related segments, what kind of demand are you seeing for specialized tools? And if you could cite some things that deal with EVs, plug-in EVs, hybrids, things like that. I think they were about -- made up about 9% of all new car sales last year. So, they're starting to get to a bigger percentage of what's at least being produced. Nick Pinchuk : They are. Those are new car sales, but they are relatively micro percentage of the car park itself. So, we -- our world reacts in it. They are -- new car sales, if you remember, are like what I think there were 14 and change last year, 15 and change this year, and 9% of that, but that's versus $283 million of total vehicle park. But where we see them is -- where we see the most, Gary, is and we're getting a lot of business in what I would call the early warning where the OEMs are seeing the idiosyncrasies associated with the electric vehicles, asking us to provide different kinds of tools for dealerships that aren't normally there to accommodate them as they come in, when they come in. And so that's what I mentioned in RS&I, that business actually was up strong -- that particular business, the project business was off strong double-digits in the quarter. And it led the way for ours. One of the things that drove it. And a big -- a portion of that was electric vehicles, like I said, we have things. Some people will ask us to do the hand tools and particular types of products to deal with the battery and other things that tend to be, as I said, specifically to electric vehicles and the OEMs figure that they wouldn't be available in the dealership. So, they have ask us to tie the dealership in those ways. Gary Prestopino : Is there anything on the diagnostics side that you're seeing? There's a demand or need for that you supply to that segment of the market? Nick Pinchuk : The diagnostic systems, although -- the category electric vehicles rolls right in that naturally. There isn't anything particularly about electric vehicles that are different for our diagnostic systems, except for the data you load on the diagnostics. And so those things are happening for us. But the same kind of bodies and so on will work, the same kind of approach in terms of diagnostics is just you have to expand that what do we have, like 2.5 billion repair records and 240 billion or 250 billion data points, and that just keeps growing to include electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids. If you look at the plug-in hybrid volume and the hybrid volume, they exploded last year too in Europe. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then I'm sorry, Nick, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Just last question. Okay. Last question, I'll jump off. In terms of tool storage, years ago when tool store, which was really driving the boat in the tools segment. Has that come down as a percentage of sales overall and it's become a little bit more diversified on the growth side? Nick Pinchuk : Actually, well, every quarter is a new story and you can't get excited about any quarter. But I would say the word to describe tool storage sales for us in this quarter is Boom Shaka Laka. The thing is it was up strong. It was one of our stronger categories. So, big ticket was up. The thing is you might ask why weren't originations up. And part of the reason is that when I was talking about tool carts are lower in terms of their per unit sales price. That's why they sweep in all these new technicians. So, via the carts we're getting new customers as well as selling some and raising our sales to old customers, because they're veterans and they want more mobility. But the new guys couldn't afford it, maybe I can't afford a Snap-On box for them. We're going to get a Snap-On quality professional cart that passes for a Snap-On box. That's partially why our tool storage went great in the quarter. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Christopher Glynn : Yes. Thanks, good morning. So on SOT and this kind of growth that's been enabled here, seeing some of the administrative processes and driving front-end production and ease for the franchisees is part of the story. Curious your response to that and if there's any specific color and sense of headroom on that curve? Nick Pinchuk : Well, the franchisees are telling me demand is off the charts. They're telling me they want more. I was just on a van down in Arkansas. And this guy tells me, he says, at the SFC, I ordered 45 full-size boxes, 45 boxes and you already see order at the SFC and they get delivered over the fall. He is out of them, and he wants more, because the guys are asking them. So, I'm telling you, I think this is why we try to emphasize this people are driving after the pandemic. And the new technology is driving demand, focusing on driving a need for people, who can handle the complexity, focusing on the importance of technicians and their wallets are burgeoning with higher wages and more work and they\u2019re looking for more of the stuff.  So our task is to be able to get our franchisees to deal with the higher sales, to be more efficient. And it seems like that's working. And to crank up the capacity to match that situation. That's what we're doing. And of course, you have to have new products. One of the great advantage that's why I talked about the carts, because we had that old segment that we were getting to, but we wanted to get to more in the carts hit them right in the bull's eye. And so that worked pretty well for us.  So those are the kinds of things that are happening there. I think we could have -- I think look, the Tools Group is leaving pre-pandemic levels behind. If you think about their numbers look, I think they are -- if you think about the last five quarters, they were 10, 15, 20, 21 and 24 versus pre-pandemic levels. They're just expanding and expanding their lead. The second derivative is growing in the Tools Group. So \u2013 and that's driven by this resilient markets and our ability \u2013 our new ability to expand the franchisees' capabilities and our new products. We're running to try to keep up. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thank you for that color. And just a couple on price and the 8% organic any sense of what the mix split of volume and price was there? And... Nick Pinchuk : Go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Yes. Okay. So yes, just any comment there. And also, curious if you're seeing any pockets within that where you're seeing area is elastic to price this area looks completely inelastic, will price more. So... Nick Pinchuk : We don't see that at all. Snap-On sets the price. One of the things is we control the customer interface. So fundamentally, we're the price leader. And so, we can do that. I mean you have to keep -- there is a point of irritation, I suppose, but we're not seeing that in this situation. But the thing about it, Chris is we have three mechanisms for pricing and they aren't also straightforward to the customer or even easy to measure.  First, we do have list price increases, which we do, do. Then we have the idea, we roll out new products like these new products associated with new carts and newly enhanced carts. Well, I assure you in an inflationary time, we get our value for those new carts. And so that tends to give us nice margin. And then there's the idea of every week on a van, there are a couple of promotions, and those promotions can be rich or lean. Now the problem is the list price, there can be variations in discounts off the list price that happen. There can be take up on promotions that are high or low, depending on the individual promotion. And there can be variations around the margins and what do you call it, whether you say that price comes out of the fact that I've got the new power tool -- power bank option on a tool storage or just because I've pushed up the pricing, it's hard to measure those things. But what I will offer is whatever happens, we like it, because the margins in the Tools Group were 22.7%, all time high. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everyone. Nice quarter, Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Hi there. David MacGregor : Yeah, nice quarter, remarkable given the 25% year ago growth and then the systems outage during the quarter. How much of this growth was due to the timing of shipments? I mean, responding to the previous question, you were talking about your guy down in Arkansas waiting for his boxes. I mean, how much of the growth was due to the timing of shipments that were delayed from 4Q when you reported US\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : No. Actually, you could ask that question in the same way. I mean the point is that I would say our calendarization of shipments were because of the interruption were pushed a little bit deeper into the quarter. So we might -- you might have argued we could have shipped more if we didn't have -- I think the way the interruption occurred, we kept -- pretty much kept selling in prior ways, but I would call nonstandard work in the terms of kaizen, and it could cause a little inefficiency. And our factories kept rolling pretty much, but the shipping was a little bit up and down in this period. So there was a little bit of back-end loading in this. So it didn't come out of the fourth quarter. It wasn't an overrun from the fourth quarter and diminishing if anything, things are getting higher. I think probably if you ask the franchisees. The franchisees, I talk to were all screaming, telling me, can you give me more. Do you have any influence in the factories, Nick Pinchuk? And so those kinds of things are those questions. Yeah, Aldo says, no. But that's really -- I don't think there's anything -- I don't think there's any story there actually, in that situation. David MacGregor : Nick, how much were off the truck sales up? Nick Pinchuk : Off the truck sales were up not as high as our own sales. They go up and down in situations. But a lot of that -- some of that has to do with the calendarization of the deliveries that came off over there. But inventories are -- I think inventories are on a nice level. The inventory turnovers are up nicely from pre-pandemic levels. So we feel pretty good about that situation. You could argue whether we want large inventories on a truck or not. I'm more for a large inventory guy, and it's a little bit lower than I'd like it to be. But still, I think sales off the truck, we're moving along, not as high as the Tools Group though, in this quarter. But if you look back every year, it always evens out. Every quarter, there's some little story around it, but it always generally evens out. We wouldn't let it get out of whack. David MacGregor : Okay. And can you just talk about the systems outage during the quarter and the impact that might have had and other growth or profitability? And did that out to result in maybe a little bit of push forward into 2Q? Nick Pinchuk : David, I don't know. You get one of these things, and it's like red alert. I remember, I stayed up all night on this situation, watching the effect, and we were -- credit to our team. They were really professional. We were back up able to do stuff right away. Now in a non-standard way, but part of it is it didn't really interrupt us very much. The big interruption, I think, was the calendarization of the shipping. And I would say, well, non-standard work is less efficient. That's why we call it standard work in terms of continuous improvement. So it's inefficient, but you still accomplish your goal. We said the number one priority was to deliver to our customers, and we generally did. Maybe we could have done a little more, I don't know. But the point is -- so I don't think -- if you step back and look at the numbers, you say, well, it doesn't look like, I can see a lot of effect there. But I assure you, there's extra cost in those numbers associated with this. I don't know if we've dimensioned it all, because it's hard to capture it all. When franchisees have to be serviced by the field, because their approach is non-standard, they're still servicing, they're still selling, but it's non-standard. Then what's that cost? It's hard to capture it. But we don't really spin our wheel thinking about that, because 20.7% OI margin. David MacGregor : Great. And just on those costs. I mean, your operating expenses and tools of 22.8%, you're down 240 basis points, which is pretty remarkable. But despite the systems outage and all the incremental costs you just referenced, you're saying, it would have actually been better? Nick Pinchuk : Well, yes, I think there might have been some of that. I don't know. I don't want to comment on that. We're not giving guidance on what the OE margins will be. I may decide to spend -- we may decide to have a big party or something at some point. I don\u2019t know, but for the franchise, but look, I think we certainly, in the quarter, we don't manage -- David, we don't manage the gross margin or the OE -- OI -- OE. We manage the OI. That's how we measure it, because when you're in inflationary times, the price goes up, there's no real -- usually, when you have commodity price goes up, there's no real cost increase in your support. On top of that, we have -- we have, as you said, the interruption which would have cost us something. So there's a complex cocktail there. So we look at, boy, and our divisions look at, give me OE, give me OI. David MacGregor : Okay. Good. That's all I\u2019ve got. Thanks very much for taking my question. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Thanks David. Operator : Our next question comes from Luke Junk of Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Luke Junk : Nick, Aldo, good morning. Nick Pinchuk : Luke, good morning. Luke Junk : I wanted to start this morning with the market turbulence you're going through right now. And what I'm wondering is, to what extent does the fact that inflation is obviously very highly visible right now help you to manage through the current environment? And specifically, are there ways that you changed your approach to price cost in an environment where inflation is as top of mind as it is right now for franchisees and your customers? Nick Pinchuk : Well, it makes it a lot easier. We've always said, for a dog's age, that we can price for visible inflation. So it helps. If everybody is getting up and looking at the paper or watching TV or looking at their iPhone and getting hearing, hey, the costs are going through the roof inflation going wow. So people tend to be more receptive to those kinds of things, and they tend to realize that that's a bargain even at a higher price. So we do that. The other thing is, as I said, this in our first rodeo. And one of the things I learned back in the Carter era, which I hate to say that even than I was senting during that period, they -- it's about urgency. It's about riding to the sound of guns. And we get right on. When we see costs going up, we're out there working on it right away, either's a continuous improvement, either redesigning. For example, we've done a lot of effort redesigning our products around chips that are available. It's not even the cost. Steel is starting to peak a little bit. But you can't get stuff, so you're out buying it on a stock market. So it's not the base cost of things, but its how you have to buy it. We tend to make sure we can deliver. So we buy on the stock market. So, for example, I just reviewed a bunch of new air conditioning units where we redesigned them all and redesigned particularly three -- or three or four, all the electronics inside to get chips that we could use. We're doing the same kind of thing in diagnostics and in our undercar equipment. So those are the kinds of things you got to do, but you got to do it with alacrity. Luke Junk : Okay. Thanks, Nick. Maybe a related question for Aldo. I'm wondering, if we look at outside of the Tools Group, to what extent does your ability to manage price costs differ by segment? If I look at some of the key considerations in C&I and RS&I relative to the dynamics in the Tools Group, are there any key differences that we should be thinking through either tactically or structurally? Aldo Pagliari : Well, yes. I'd say, broadly speaking, Luke, is that RS&I and C&I, when they do have to entertain pricing actions, there is a lag basis. And the reason for that is, unless you're going to invoke force majeure, which you don't want to, if you don't have to. Sometimes you have one-year contracts in place with certain key customers, national accounts or certain large industrial customers. Oftentimes, we have distribution relationships, who have a requirement of a 60, 90-day advance notice. So you have to be more measured and because they don't use as exclusively the Snap-on brand. The Snap-on brand is a very powerful brand, which the Tools Group does enjoy. You make the case at C&I and RS&I a little bit more mortal when they walk around the immortality of the Tools Group. They have to be cognizant of what's happening in and around them, because they don't operate in a vacuum. There's some big competitors in and around them. So they can not make pricing decisions in a vacuum so to speak. As Nick mentioned earlier, you can argue Snap-on and the Tools Group is the price leader and it sets the umbrella for others. In the case of C&I and RS&I, I think they have to be cognizant that they're a major player and they are an influencer, but they do not walk alone. Luke Junk : Yes. Really appreciate that. All those super helpful color. Last question, I just want to ask something a little bigger picture. Nick, you had mentioned last quarter that you were taking a more refined approach to data mining as an area as it is right now. And just wondering if there's any color you can share there on specific areas where you see the opportunity to be, I guess, I'd call it smarter in the tools business or alternatively, any areas where you're already seeing traction ultimately? Just trying to get a feel of where you're leaning in with this initiative. Thanks. Nick Pinchuk : Well, the whole purpose of that is to try to model the individual customer -- by individual to try to call in the air strikes of the selling approach for the van driver, so that his selling will be more efficient, and therefore, he can call and spend more times with tougher customers, reach more customers, and that is the principal focus of that. That's what I can share with you. And we're making progress in that regard, but I don't really have any palpable things to report. We've been a little busy this quarter. So -- but still, we're working on that, but I don't have anything to lay out, just about the principal focus. And we're kind of optimistic that it will work, because if anybody's got a database about people, about technicians. If anybody knows technicians, it's Snap-on. Luke Junk : Looking good. Well, interesting stuff. We will stay tuned. Thanks for that Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Sure. Operator : We'll go next to Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Hi, Bret. Bret Jordan : One more question, I guess, on pricing, trying to sort of distill it down some. Obviously, lots of labor and materials and supply chain expenses. And I get your point about sort of mix can change or you throw in a free \u2013 extra charger to enhance the value proposition. But, is there any sort of base way to look at like a like-for-like screw driver versus a screwdriver in the prior year period on price? I just sort of try to get a feeling for what that contribution was to organic. Nick Pinchuk : And we've thought about that. I don't think I can help you. It's just too complex. I mean we raised, we raised the list price. But even the list price raise doesn't necessarily make it through. It tends to move it up in varying places depending on the product line. So it's hard to measure really. And the point about the individual promotions, they just vary all over the place. We simply manage on a macro basis, because when you got when you got trucks that have 4,000 SKUs on the truck and have a catalog of 40,000 SKUs, it's kind of a fool's errand to try to figure all this out, try to get macro out of the individual. We simply try to measure how we're doing and try to see what worked before and try to make sure that we get pricing along all those quarters, list, promotions and new products. And believe that it's going to get us in the right situation. And generally, so far, it has. Our own sales if you look at the sales for Snap-on in terms of growth \u2013 it was \u2013 I think our five quarters were 9%, 10%, 11%, 13% and now 16.9% above pre-pandemic levels. So somehow it's expanding growth. And not all of that is pricing because you can see the margins go up right in tune with it. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then one big picture question. I guess, as you talk about the increasing vehicle complexity and sort of the shortage of technicians and the aging demographic. Are you seeing any sort of change in total shop rooftops? And are big groups getting bigger as they've got access to the diagnostics and the technology, or is it pretty even? Nick Pinchuk : I would have said that maybe before the pandemic, but I'm not seeing it now so much. I don't know. But you might say, I do think \u2013 I will say to you, I think service doesn't scale so easily. It has \u2013 that's been a problem in many industries. So I'm not so sure. Collision scales because it's almost like manufacturing in a lot of ways. But the service is a little tougher to scale, I think. So I don't know how much of that we'll see unless you see like a specialized group. Now maybe we will, and we have those as our customers, too. We do see multiple shops, but they don't seem to be very, let's say, nationwide or anything like that. Sometimes, we're seeing some opportunities call, localized multi-location situations. Mitchell One has made a meal out of that with their ProDemand, and those things have worked there. But in terms of the franchisees, I don't think they report that so much. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our final question from Sarah Park with Bank of America. Sarah, your line is open. Please go ahead. Sarah Park : Hi. This is Sarah Park on for Liz Suzuki. I think you had mentioned this a little bit earlier, but I was just been wondering if you could speak to any kind of like material disruption in March from the security breach and network shutdown, if you have any more color on that? That would be helpful. Nick Pinchuk : Well. No. Actually, I don't think \u2013 there were what I would call non-standard ways of operating and serving our customers for a matter of days, not weeks. And as I said before, it principally set back the shipping processes, whereby, the calendarization of the quarter shipments tended to coagulate around at the rear end. But generally, we did not -- we didn't have any -- we didn't really have real disruption and there's been a lot of speculation, but we were hacked, a ransomware company. We didn't pay ransom. We didn't have to pay a ransom in this situation. And so we felt we got out of this and managed it pretty well. So that's really the story there, inefficiencies more than disruption and recalendarization. Sarah Park : Thank you. Operator : With no other questions holding, I will now turn the conference back to Ms. Verbsky for any additional or closing comments. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect.",

With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I will start the call by covering the highlights of our second quarter. Along the way, I will give you my perspective on our results, once again they are encouraging. And our market, the robust, resilient and promising and I will talk about our progress. We believe we are now stronger than ever and we will also speak about what it all means and we believe it means that we are better positioned for more, a lot more. Then Aldo will go into a more detailed review of the financials. All you have to do is follow the news and you know that we live today in the midst of turmoil, inflation, variants supply, continuing unpredictable outbreak, precipitous lockdowns and a war in the Ukraine and Snap-on has shown through it all, wielding our advantages in product and brand, and in people, progressing down our runways for growth, engaging our Snap-on value creation, driving improvement, making the most of our resilient markets and extending our positive trajectory, piercing the turbulence. The story of our second quarter is simply one of rising momentum. We have been meeting the challenges quarter after quarter and we are simply getting even better at overcoming the difficulties, and going forward, we are confident of our capabilities continue to advance and here are the numbers that say we should be confident. Our reported sales in the quarter were $1 billion, $136.6 million, up versus last year by $55.2 million or 5.1%, including $32.4 million or 330 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth was 8.4% with gains in every Group. And compared to the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, our upward drive is clear as a bell versus 2019 Sales in the quarter rose 19.5% as reported and 18.7% organically. This is now eight straight quarters of being above pre-pandemic levels. We believe we are continuing an ongoing trend of accelerating expansion and are building momentum with emphasis, increasing higher and higher, demonstrating that we are only getting stronger every day. The Opco operating income of $246.6 million, was up $29.5 million and the operating margin, it was 21.7%, up 160 basis points from last year and 170 basis points from 2019. For financial services operating income of $65.3 million, compared to the $68.9 million of last year and that result combined with Opco for a consolidated operating margin of 25.5%, up 100 basis points from last year and 130 from 2019. And EPS was $4.27, up 13.6% from last year and 32.6% above the comparable pre-pandemic level recorded in 2019, up $3.22. I have been saying this since the third quarter of 2020, I will say it again, we believe is Snap-on the stronger now than when we entered this great withering and the second quarter numbers say it so. Now let\u2019s talk about the markets. Auto repair remains positive. Most if, not all -- most, if not all of our key indicators are quite favorable spending on vehicle maintenance and spending on vehicle maintenance and repair, up, number of techs, up, mechanic wages, up. The techs are optimistic about their prospects and about the greater need for the skills as new technologies, new complexities advanced across the car park and we saw a confirmation of in that broadly held believe, for several quarters now is a number of automotive repair technicians continue expanding upward period-after-period, higher now than any of the last three decades. And when I speak with shop owners or managers, as I often do, it\u2019s clear that there is a need for more, many more and that Snap-on we love it. Vehicle repair is a strong and resilient market, a feeling that\u2019s also reinforced by our franchisees. You can see it in our numbers. You can hear it in their voices. We believe they are more prosperous than ever. Besides franchisees and technicians, there\u2019s vehicle repair shop owners and managers, this is RS&I arena. Demand for new and used cars is high, but supplies are limited, it\u2019s a well known Story. The pandemic has impacted the auto supply chain, sure. But it doesn\u2019t matter. Lots of new cars or scarcity of new vehicles, the car park is large, ageing, getting more complex and demand for repair remains strong, come back to high water and the shops are seeing this clearly and starting to invest to meet the currently need and get ready for the future. The variety of drivetrains is expanding, internal combustion, hybrid, plug-in electric, full electric and every day there\u2019s more driver assistance and more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity. Shops now have a greater need for new and upgraded equipment and they are becoming more and more rely on service and repair information to guide them through the galaxy of new requirements and procedures, it\u2019s all music to our ears actually. Snap-on makes great tools and equipment and it\u2019s clearly repair and information headquarters. RS&I has taken advantage of that trend, creating new equipment offered and advanced database solutions. We now have a strong array of products in that vital areas. Mitchell 1 repair information software and shop management software, SPX, electronic parts catalog, our dealer shop management technologies, electric vehicle health check solutions and our heavy-duty and fast track intelligent diagnostics hardware. These are big databases and getting more powerful and easier to use, helping the shop to fix it right the first time and efficiently. The repair shop is changing, rising in complexity and ours -- and I has the products to match it. Finally, let\u2019s talk about critical industries. At Snap-on, we say Snap-on rolls out of the garage solving tasks of consequence and we do. This is C&I territory, our most international operation and it\u2019s where we see the most continuing impact of the pandemic and it\u2019s in children like supply chain inflation and supply chain disruption and inflation, where customers have been slower to accommodate, where headwinds are still persisting and where our multi-SKU product offerings are particularly impacted by supply chain challenges. I suppose everybody knows about the two-month lockdown in Shanghai, that area is a significant C&I business center and it\u2019s also key transportation hub for our China factory, so the lockdown was an obstacle. And beyond that focused event, C&I is particularly challenged by its considerable geographic reach, adjusting with the varying impacts and protocols and economic turbulence from countries with a varying virus impacts and protocols and the economic turbulence from country-to-country. But I would say, if you look at the quarter, the C&I team rose to the occasion, and in the quarter, we won gains in North America, in Europe and in Asia, despite the difficulties. So I\u2019d describe our C&I markets as representing continuing opportunity and coupled with automotive repair, we believe our overall markets are robust right now and there is considerably more opportunity ahead as we move along our runways for growth. And I can leave this section about robust progress in abundant possibilities without once again speaking of our -- of the engine of our advanced Snap-on value creation, particularly in customer connection and innovation, developing new products and solution born of the observation gathered right in the workplace, insights that create great new offerings, and at the same time, help guide the expansion of our franchisee selling capacity with better processes, more effective training and more powerful communication, all of that helped drive our progress, overcoming the difficulties, accommodating the virus, taking full advantage of the market opportunities, starting a continuing positive trend moving forward and we are going to keep it going. Well, that\u2019s the overview now, let\u2019s move to the segments. In the C&I Group, sales in the quarter were up 2.5% as reported or 8.6 million versus 2021 and that includes $25.3 million or 6 point -- 7 point, that includes a $25.3 million or 7.6% organic gain driven by progress across all our divisions. From an earnings perspective, C&I income was 51.7%, a decrease of $3.8 million compared to 2021, $2 million of that was unfavorable foreign currency and the rest represents the impact of supply chain turbulence on the multi-SKU C&I products. The OI margin was 14.4%, down 140 basis points from 2021, but did represent progress and then it\u2019s a 100 basis -- 100 point sequential improvement from the last quarter, when compared with the pre-pandemic 2019 periods, sales were up 7.4% organically and the OI margin of 14.4% was down 20 basis points, but that included an 80-point impact from acquisitions and unfavorable currency. Now continuing bright spot in C&I this quarter and again this quarter was SNA Europe, it did deliver yet another quarter growth, expanding double-digit year-over-year and well beyond pre-pandemic levels, all against the wins in Europe with innovative solutions of our Bahco Erle tool management system leading the way, tailoring product specific to customer needs. Europe is a varied market and SNA Europe is making increasing gains by matching the products to the specific tasks. And that positive SNA Europe was joined in C&I, quite valuable contribution from recovering areas in critical industries like aerospace, in general industry and from countries, in Asia-Pacific, like, India, Japan and South Korea. All combines overcome the decline and slower to recover sectors like the military and natural resources. We do remain confident and committed to extending in critical industries and that commitment is confirmed with great new products. Speaking of product, last quarter to help solve crucial tasks across both critical industries and automotive repair, we strengthened our 14.4 Volt MicroLithium power tool lineup with the new Snap-on CT761 3/8-inch Impact Wrench. It\u2019s a very attractive, but it\u2019s also quite functional. Featuring a compact design to reach tight spaces, a nylon-based housing for rugged durability and a special toggle switch trigger for precise control. The new unit also includes a try being headlight for broad illumination entire work area and now that\u2019s a feature that makes complex multi-point jobs much easier in the low-light conditions that often occur in the workshop or enrolled repair. You can imagine it. The Impact Wrench also delivers a robust 225 foot pounds of breakaway torque and it\u2019s controlled by a variable speed drive. So the operator can apply just the right torque for each job and the 14 volt battery with its 2.5 amp hours ensure it\u2019s consistent output and an extended run time which makes for a lot more efficient workday. The CT361 began shipping early in the quarter and it was right on target, quickly becoming a million hit product and it\u2019s sold out and what seem like a blink of an eye. Great product. Well, that\u2019s C&I, a promising quarter, volume up nicely, starting to overcome the turbulence, moving down it\u2019s runways for growth. Now for the Tools Group, sales of $520.6 million, up $36.5 million, including $7.7 million of unfavorable currency and a 9.3% organic gains and the operating margin 23.9%, up 250 basis points compared with pre-virus 2019 sales grew $114.8 million, including a 28% -- 28.1% organic gain and this quarter is 23.9% operating margin was up 630 basis points compared with those pre-virus numbers, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed. Another positive quarter for the Tools Group with growth across all product lines and beyond as we see further indications of continuing strength. Other data like the franchisee health metrics, which we monitor every quarter, they remain quite favorable and on a clearly positive trend. We do believe our van network remains quite strong and it\u2019s not just the numbers. Just a few weeks ago, I spent time with a couple of dozen franchisees representing the regions on our U.S. and Canadian national franchisee advisory councils, and they were motivated and prosperous, enthusiastic about the current performance, positive about the trajectories of the other vans and various areas that they represent and very optimistic about the prospects for even more going forward. They believe in their opportunities and they are confident about their future. The Tools Group, strong quantitatively and qualitatively and that positivity was not just internal. Once again this quarter, it was reinforced by the external view. Snap-on was recognized again this year among the top 50 in the franchise industry by Entrepreneur Magazine. And once again in that ranking, we rated in the top of the Tools Distribution category, a place we have for some time and this type of recognition reflects fundamental, contemporary strength of our franchisees and of our overall mobile van network. It is a powerhouse business and that momentum would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of unique new products. And one of those that helped drive our hand tools up again this quarter, again this quarter was our new Long Nose Slip Joint Pliers. It\u2019s a special tool with our patented 3-Position joint precisely machine for effortless switch -- for effortless switching and control, allowing the pliers to -- it allows the pliers to keep the jaws parallel increasing the contact with the work piece, with its indicated -- it\u2019s got a relocated joint, optimized handle shape and unique Talon Grip-serrated jaws. With all of that our new pliers provide over 50% more pulling power. The machined and hardened teeth are sharp and strong and present three different gripping geometries, from heavy serrations at the base to fine grooves at the tip, great variability for multiple applications. You can apply different parts of the jaw. They are manufactured right here in our Milwaukee factory and they are manufactured from special cold forged allied steel for greater durability and strength. These players were launched at the beginning of the past quarter and they have been very well received. When I talk to the franchisees of the NFAC, they said are flying off the truck, and they are right. The sales have already made a hit product strategy just in one quarter. Our new offerings are in fact making a difference in the Tools Group, you can\u2019t miss it in the numbers, eight straight quarters above pre-pandemic levels. The Tools Group is moving onward and upward with eye-catching momentum and if you look at the numbers or spend any time with the team, you believe it\u2019s all systems go and it is. Now on to RS&I, sales were up 4.6% or $18.2 million versus last year, including $27.4 million or 7% organic uplift with double-digit growth in undercar equipment with diagnostics and information advancing and with the dealership activity flat from an earnings perspective RS&I operating income of $95.7 million, represents a rise of $9 million or 10.4% and the operating margin was 23%, up 120 basis points in the last year. Compared with 2019, sales were up 19.5% as reported and the organic growth was $58 million or 16.8% with strong advances in undercar equipment and diagnostics and information products. For profitability, the OI margin of 23% was down 240 basis points versus 2019, pretty much reflecting 110 point impact just from acquisitions and the effect of the margin dilutions from the higher sales of undercar equipment that we have been seeing. We believe RS&I has great opportunities and we are fortifying its way forward with new products like our Hofmann 609 aligner, specifically designed for independent or general repair shops, where alignment is -- it\u2019s not currently a primary focus and the space is short. The new offering allows those all-purpose garage to keep the low volume alignment business in-house with its compact footprint and portability kit enabling easy storage when not in use and efficient deployment when alignment is actually need. It saves a lot of space, but it gets the job done. With our latest 3D system authoring OEM approved accuracy, the 609 enables the handling of even the most complex alignment systems by those general repair shops. It generates a high return on the investment, doesn\u2019t occupy space needed for other repairs -- often needed for other repairs and it fortifies the garage\u2019s reputation for technical capability. It\u2019s a great value for the general repair shops and they are noticing. Our equipment business has been on a roll with strong double-digit equipment growth for double-digit quarters for some time and the Hofmann 609 aligner is a big player in that mix. RS&I, approving its position with repair shop owners and managers, growth in undercar equipment and diagnostics and information projects, products and an array of innovative new products and product lines to lead the way. Well, those are the highlights of our quarter, Tools Group, strong progress everywhere, unmistakable strength. C&I, recording a positive performance against the variation across industries and geographies and RS&I, expanding profitable volume with repair shop owners and managers. Snap-on overall sales rising markedly, both versus last year up 8.4% organically and up 18.7% organically compared with pre-pandemic levels continuing clear positive trajectory. Opco operating margin are strong 21.7%, rising again in this quarter rising again this quarter, up 160 basis points. EPS $4.27, up versus last year, up versus last quarter and up versus pre-pandemic levels. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I will turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Nick, thanks. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $1,136.6 million in the quarter increased 5.1% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $32.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflects high single-digit growth in each of the company\u2019s segments and compares to an 8% year-over-year organic increase recorded last quarter. Consolidated gross margin of 48.7%, remained the same as last quarter, but declined 150 basis points from 50.2% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions, as well as from benefits from the company\u2019s RCI initiatives and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Again this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the costs and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27% improved 310 basis points from 30.1% last year. The improvement is primarily due to higher sales volumes, savings from RCI initiatives and lower cost associated with stock-based expenses, operating earnings from financial services of $246.6 million in the quarter, compared to $217.1 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.7%, improved 160 basis points from last year and was up 140 basis points sequentially. Financial services revenue of $86.4 million in the second quarter of 2022, compared to $86.9 million last year. Operating earnings of $65.3 million, a decrease $3.6 million from 2021 levels, primarily as a result of higher provisions for credit losses and those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $311.9 million, compared to $286 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.5%, improved 100 basis points from 24.5% in 2021. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 23.8%, compared to 23.3% last year. Net earnings of $231.5 million or $4.27 per diluted share increased $23.5 million or $0.51 per share from last year\u2019s levels, representing a 13.6% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results, starting with the C&I Group on slide seven. Sales of $359.1 million increased from $350.5 million last year, reflecting a $25.3 million or 7.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $16.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segments European based hand tools business and Asia-Pacific operations, as well as a mid single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. Within critical industries, solid gains in general industry and international aviation more than offset lower sales to the military. Gross margin of 37.3%, although improving sequentially, declined 220 basis points from 39.5% in the second quarter of 2021. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs being partially offset by the benefits from higher sales volumes and pricing actions and savings from the segment\u2019s RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.9% in the quarter, improved 80 basis points from 23.7% in 2021, primarily due to the effects of higher sales volumes. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $51.7 million, compared to $55.5 million last year. The operating margin of 14.4%, compared to 15.8% a year ago. Turning now to slide eight, sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $520.6 million, increased 7.5% from $484.1 million in 2021, reflecting a 9.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $7.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. In the U.S., sales were up across all product lines and include a particularly robust sales of full-storage in the quarter. Gross margin of 46% in the quarter, compared to 45.5% in the first quarter of this year, but declined 80 basis points from 46.8% last year. The year-over-year decline is primarily due to higher material and other costs, and 10 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from higher sales volumes and pricing actions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales 22.1%, improved 330 basis points from 25.4% last year, reflecting the benefits from higher sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives, and including the effects of lower expenses associated with the company\u2019s franchisees stock purchase program. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $124.4 million, compared to $103.5 million last year. The operating margin of 23.9% improved 250 basis points from 21.4% a year ago. Turning to RS&I Group, shown on slide nine, sales of $416.8 million, compared to $398.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of a double-digit increase in sales of undercar equipment and a low single-digit gain in the sale of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Activity with OEM dealerships was essentially flat. Gross margin of 43.2%, declined 150 basis points from 44.7% last year. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs and increased sales in lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives, as well as from 50 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.2%, improved 270 basis points from 22.9% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, including higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings from the RS&I Group of $95.7 million, compared to $86.7 million last year. The operating margin 23%, improved 120 basis points from 21.8% reported a year ago. Now turning to slide 10, revenue from financial services of $86.4 million, including $800,000 of unfavorable currency translation, compared to $86.9 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $65.3 million, compared to $68.9 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $21.1 million were up $3.1 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $2.4 million of increased provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus a historically lower provision rate experienced last year, loan portfolio trends remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1% and eight-tenths of 1% in the second quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In both the second quarters of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on finance and contract receivables were 17.5% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $307.6 million in the second quarter increased $21.8 million or 7.6% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 11% increase in originations of finance receivables, partially offset by decrease in the origination of contract receivables. Moving to slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $1.9 billion from our U.S. operations. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.4% for the U.S. extended credit is the same as comparable pre-pandemic period of 2019 and reflects the seasonal improvement we typically experience in the second quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, the trailing 12-month net losses of $40.4 million represented 2.33% of outstandings at quarter end, which is down slightly from the 2.34% reported at the end of last quarter. Now turning to slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $140.8 million in the quarter, compared to $238.2 million last year. The decrease in the second quarter of 2021 primarily reflects an $87.7 million increase in working investment. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, including increases in receivables and higher levels of inventory this year. In addition to demand base requirements, the inventory increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts, as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $73.8 million, included net additions to finance receivables of $53.5 million and capital expenditures of $21.3 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $112.2 million, included cash dividends of $75.7 million and the repurchase of $251,000 shares of common stock for $53.8 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $420.8 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $46.8 million from 2021 year end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days, compared to 58 days at 2021 year end. Inventories increased $89.5 million from 2021 year end and on a trailing 12-month basis inventory turns of 2.7 compared to 2.8 at year end 2021. Our quarter end cash position of $812.9 million, compared to $780 million at year end 2021. Our net debt to capital ratio of 8.3% compared to 9.1% at year end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities and as of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I will now briefly review a few outlook items for 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate absent any changes to U.S. tax legislation that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I will now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, that\u2019s our second quarter. Markets that are resilient and getting more robust by the day. These are interesting times in the pandemic, inflation, supply interruptions, a war, and pop-up lockdowns, but Snap-on brings to this turbulence considerable advantage in product, in brand and in people. It\u2019s enabled our team to cut through the turbulence, continuing a positive trajectory and you can see it in the performance. C&I on a growth path again, with a 7.6% organic increase, despite being our most impacted business. RS&I, gains with repair shop owners and managers, driven by hardware and its expanding information portfolio, sales up 7% organically and NOI margin of 22%, up 120 basis points from last year. And the Tools Group, gangbusters results, sales up 9.3% organically versus last year and up 28.1% versus 2019, eight straight quarters above pre-pandemic levels and NOI margin of 23.9%. And it all came together for overall Snap-on organic growth of 8.4%, NOI margin of 21.7% and an EPS of $4.27, all high watermarks despite the turbulence. It was an encouraging quarter and we emerge from that period with rising momentum. It is a turbulent time, but Snap-on is driven by attractive markets, by unique strengths and by an experienced and capable team that\u2019s achieved clear and consistent performance and period-by-period has become stronger and stronger in navigating the issues of the day. And we believe these inherent advantages will continue to prevail as we go forward on a clear an upward trajectory through the remainder of this year and well beyond. Before I turn the call over to the, Operator, I will speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know they listen in. The corporation is an organization where people come together to create a benefit for themselves and others that they could not alter individually. You have done just that again this quarter. For your success in that endeavor you have my congratulations. For the energy and the skill you bring to our efforts, you have my admiration and for the commitment you unfailingly demonstrate to our team, you have my thanks. Now I will turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We can take our first question now from Scott Stember of MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning and congrats on the very strong results. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Scott. Scott Stember : Can we talk about Tools? You mentioned that, everything was up, and it sounded like Tool storage had another very strong quarter. Was that related to the new mobile cart and maybe just try to size up how big tools storage was in the quarter and trying to figure out... Nick Pinchuk : Now, I don\u2019t like to give you -- I don\u2019t, I think, it\u2019s -- you start worrying too much of our quarter-to-quarter, Scott, Scott you go hikidi, bikidi, boo [ph] around here about, because things change depending on the models you bring up. But I will say that Tool storage was the leader, it was double digits, a nice quarter and it came -- and targets were in a factor, what happened at this time is, we started to get more of the bigger boxes out, the EPIQ and the Master Series. We had some great new offerings. Our Supernova Masters Series with the electric blue and the copper trim, that seemed very popular. So it was a great quarter. Carts were continued to be strong, but EPIQ, the bigger boxes, the regular tool storage box, we could call Roll Cabs or not made the difference. So it was a pretty good quarter. The Tools Group really, I mean, I think, it did have a great quarter. By the way, did I mention that the Tools Group NOI margin was 23.9% in the quarter? I think, I have mentioned that. That was -- I think that says it all. I will tell you. And by the way, in the quarter hand tools were already -- were also up and also -- that\u2019s a nice factor for us, up strongly. But the big impact in the quarter... Scott Stember : And then\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Scott Stember : Go ahead. I am sorry. Nick Pinchuk : Go ahead. Go ahead. Scott Stember : I was going to ask about the selling to the van and off of the van the inventory situation right now on the van? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Look, the inventories are up, the guys are crying for more inventory, when they go out there and their inventory turns are substantially below pre-pandemic levels. So the inventory turns are higher at this time and not below pre-pandemic levels, they are above pre-pandemic levels. So they are substantially higher at this time. And the sell-through was better this quarter than it was last quarter. When you look at it overall, it seems to be right in line with our overall sales. So we think it\u2019s moving along nicely. I do believe our guys want more inventory. I do believe they want more. And I would say in our business, there\u2019s still, we got a little better at delivering, but we still like, we still have a pretty good backlog. People are clamoring for our products still. Scott Stember : Got it. And then lastly in RS&I, you talked about undercar doing really well. Is that related to the collision part of the business or is that just across the board? Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Well, it\u2019s across the Board, but the collision business has been a star in this situation. We acquired Car-O-Liner a few years ago and we anticipated that collision with the deployment of the neural network around the sensors, around the sort of driver assist systems would make collision a very lucrative area and it seems to have played out. So collision is among the top four undercar equipment, but generally it\u2019s all roll pretty well. The independent repair shops are optimistic. They are seeing the, well, I said it in my call, investment up, spending up, technicians up, wages up, they can see it all come in through. So they are white hot in terms of their optimism, in terms of the situation. So it get them to invest more. That\u2019s what you are seeing in undercar equipment. Scott Stember : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Thanks. Operator : We can now take our next question from Luke Junk of Baird. Please go ahead. Luke Junk : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First I wanted to ask about originations is on positive this quarter up nicely both year-on-year and up really strong sequentially following some fits and starts recently. Can you just give us a peek under the hood there in terms of what\u2019s driving that? Do you think it\u2019s sustainable and what if any impacted last quarter system breach have on the numbers this quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Last quarter, I don\u2019t think had any impact on this quarter. But it was mostly in the last quarter where you saw, it might have had some impact on originations, because last quarter you -- from a sales point of view, there was a skewing towards the back end of the quarter, because the breach was in the early parts of the quarter, so you saw that going out. And as I said, last time we thought we had pretty robust sales in some of the big ticket items, but they hadn\u2019t made their way through the vans yet necessarily and that probably worked out this quarter. I think the big driver though, Luke, is the product. I think the optimism of the technicians and the product itself. I think, what does drive originations is the view of people saying, wow. I really like these EPIQ boxes I got and we had a more available now. We are getting better at delivering them. During the pandemic we had some fits and starts, so we are pushing a little more carts and now we have a little bit more of the basic roll cabs. So I think that\u2019s what drove the higher originations in this time. We still see pretty good RA, the finance by the franchisees seemed pretty solid. That wasn\u2019t down in the course. So that was pretty strong. As I said, hand tools were up. So I think it\u2019s pretty much product driven. What you see in the Tools Group, I mean, the Tools Group is on a pretty big momentum. If you look back over the pre-pandemic levels, they were up 9%, and what was that, Q4 2020 then 15%, then17%, then 21%, then 22%, then 24% and 28% this quarter. And by the way, they came through the quarter, they exited the quarter stronger. They are on the mail train. They have got momentum rolling. And so I feel pretty good about that and that\u2019s playing out in some of the now broader product lines in Tool Storage. We did, as I said in the last call, that doesn\u2019t mean that carts were down any, they were still strong in the quarter just that the low cash got bigger. Luke Junk : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for that, Nick. And then second question within RS&I, I will ask on undercar equipment again. It\u2019s been an area of consistent strength in that business going all the way back to the start of 2021, we count six straight quarters of double-digit growth overall. Where do you think we are in the investment cycle there, realizing that growth has been weighing on RS&I gross margins and looking forward to some point when that starts to normalize? How quickly would you anticipate higher software margins starting to come through at that point as well? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think, look, I think, higher software margins are, you are going to see it, one of the things you are seeing in our -- remember we said, we are pivoting away from titles where we sold updates, we call it titles, but they are basically updates on software every six months, we are pivoting to a subscription business. So that tends to stretch out your revenue was a little bit -- it effects revenues in the quarter. And so, but our subscriptions are up deep, our subscribers are up deep double digits in this quarter year-over-year. So that seems to be working for us. So we are pretty pumped about the possibilities in that, but you know you have some, I guess, I would say, recognition questions as you go through this period. So you don\u2019t quite see it coming through, but I can see it coming through in the future. And as I said, with the array of electronic products we have around software, from the diagnostic software to the Mitchell 1 software, to Dealer-FX to electronic parts catalogs to vehicle checks. We feel we are repair, information headquarters and it\u2019s going to become bigger and we are going to see it roll through that business earlier. Now if you ask me to expect to see the equipment business attenuate, I hope not. I am not hoping for it, just because it\u2019s low margin, it doesn\u2019t seem, it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t want the profits, I do. So and I could see that go, that was down -- you might remember, it was down, it was pretty much flat on its back for a couple of quarters, couple of three quarters earlier and it\u2019s bouncing back from that. We have seen a lot in independent repair shops and I would figure after the dealerships start to get used to the situation, I think, they will discombobulated by the low supply and what are they doing associated with this sort of a little bit -- little more reluctant in situation. When they come online, I think, that will be even greater. Luke Junk : Then if I could just sneak one more in, maybe this one would be\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Luke Junk : \u2026 good for Aldo to tackle? Could you just remind us of how rising interest rates affect the credit company, both in terms of funding, if at all, in the rates that you charge and in particular, I am just wondering if there is anything that you think is miss perceived that you would want to address about a rising interest rate environment? Thanks. Aldo Pagliari : Thanks for the question, Luke. Actually it has a little affect if anything it might create a more favorable environment. And why do I say that? Again, we fund long. So if you look at Snap-On\u2019s balance sheet, we don\u2019t fund day-to-day. So the rising interest rates do not have a foreseeable immediate impact on our borrowing capability, because as you could see there\u2019s plenty of cash on the balance sheet and there is nothing that\u2019s coming due for quite some time. So we are stable in terms of the cost of our funds going into that business. Our stated rates have been pretty consistent really for decade plus. So and they are not the lowest rate out there, but they are lower than what might be available to people that are on a credit card format and things of that nature. So we think our rates are appropriate for the credit profile of the customers that we serve, we think that they -- those types of customers recognize that. So we are the kind of the lender of choice if they do decide to engage in any type of lending activity. And I think because we provide that stability, it gives a little bit a form of reassurance, so as interest rates go up competitors rates, if they were ever considering them, and when I say competitors, I am thinking of things like credit cards. So as interest rates are going to be going up for people that are in the subprime category. So we are going to be pretty stable and our approach is going to be pretty consistent. Yeah, I think the competitions rates might be going up, which you could argue maybe creates a slightly more favorable environment. Luke Junk : Okay. I will leave it there. Thank you for all the color this morning. Operator : We can now take our next question from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Bret Jordan : When you think about the organic growth, and obviously, it\u2019s pretty inflationary environment, could you talk about sort of with the contribution from units are versus the contribution from price and then, I guess, as a follow-up, I think, well, I will ask that first then I have a follow-up. Nick Pinchuk : Go ahead. Go ahead. Ask the follow-up one. Bret Jordan : The follow-up, I think you called out, I think, in C&I and RS&I sort of inflation in some of the cost of goods. And could you sort of talk about where you are seeing, is it metals, labor, where are you seeing inflation, what you can do to sort of pass that through and the timing of that? Nick Pinchuk : And by the way, just, Bret, before the Tools Group will execute -- Tools Group guys will execute be if I leave this conference call, not saying that it also have inflationary impacts on it and price is going up. So it\u2019s not just RS&I and C&I. They also have to deal with that and I got to give them credit for that. But look, here is the thing, it\u2019s hard for us to determine, because we know we have some pricing, but it isn\u2019t the majority of it. Looking at our factories, we know we have products in demand. There is rolling off there and our guys are up to their eyeballs in demand. So we know that\u2019s a positive situation. The other thing is it\u2019s hard, because you know we have list prices. But the list prices don\u2019t -- are very from product to product and they come out on an average, you might say your raising sales 3.5% or something like that but products. And then overlaying on top of that we have a lot of new tools, we keep roll in new tool. In fact, million dollar tools we have dozens a quarter rolling out and then, across the network. And then we have promotions that occur week to week and they can be lean or rich and taken up the big effect. So it\u2019s hard for us to say. I would say the minority of the increases in pricing and the majority is in volume for us. We think that\u2019s the situation in this situation in our environment. Now, that varies from Group to Group and so on. Now if you talk about where we are getting the biggest impact, our biggest inflationary impact, Bret, is trying to buy on the spot market, because we have said we want to deliver the best we can. We have demand. We want to deliver. We are not keeping up with all the demand, but so we are buying like chips on the spot market. And I can go -- that can fluctuate wildly. We buy components for power tools and other things on a spot market, that can move wildly. If you look at commodities, I would say, look, we buy several, many grades of steel, but if you look at steel for tool storage and steel for, let\u2019s say, lifts, hot rolled and cold rolled, there both coming off a little bit. They are getting a little better. They are coming down. If you look at steel for hand tools, it\u2019s at its top and now they are still not back to the steady state levels but they backed off a little bit. The steel for hand tools, which we call rod steel, that\u2019s pretty much reached the top level and it\u2019s flattened out but it hasn\u2019t abated for us yet and we are not seeing too much abatements in freight, you see those kinds of things flowing through. I would expect this stuff, as I believe that as the COVID turbulent start the micro viscosity start -- stop happening, you are going to see the stuff start to drift downwards, because you are not going to have the interruptions in supply and therefore it\u2019s going to get more regular and therefore the prices are going to come down. But I don\u2019t have a crystal ball on that. That\u2019s sort of our view of the situation. Bret Jordan : Okay. If you were to think about your price inflation, your sticker price inflation year-to-date, I guess, how would you -- is it up, mid-low, mid-single digits on pricing? Nick Pinchuk : It\u2019s hard for me to say because it changes. It\u2019s all over the map depending on where you are. In the Tools Group, you have a list price and the other places, you are pricing product-by-product and it depends on the size of the product and a lot of different things. So, all I am saying is, I think, if you wanted to step back and you look at our pricing, it\u2019s the minority of our growth. Bret Jordan : Okay. Great. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Hopefully get share, get volume out of it, Bret. Okay. Operator : And we can now take our next question from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Nick Pinchuk : Hi, Chris. Christopher Glynn : So, Nick, some -- hey. Some pretty strong comments on the momentum and the tenure across the Tools Group. I did want to drill down into that in terms of, we -- the relative contributions of market penetration and overall kind of advancing into technicians not traditionally served versus a revenue per technician type of equation. Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. We don\u2019t have -- it\u2019s hard for us to get a handle on all of that, because you tend to start out with people at lower levels. But we are adding technicians. I can\u2019t parse that thing for you. We are certainly aiming at that and it\u2019s been successful, but we are also selling more to the existing technicians because their wages are going up, they are getting more optimistic. And also it\u2019s not a situation where we see static activities. I will say the number of technicians we have on the books are going up and that includes some new people. So that\u2019s about all I can give you on that. I think there are both things in play at least, because of the... Christopher Glynn : Okay. Nick Pinchuk : And it makes sense. I just want to add this, because it makes sense, because we believe it\u2019s great for us to get new technicians and that\u2019s a one component of growth that I have talked about for a dog\u2019s age here. But it\u2019s also in this environment clear that existing technicians, young or old are going to need new products. And they are actually going to need more a greater array of these products as you get more and different powertrain, as you get more of these automated features in the system. So we anticipate both effects being lucrative forward motion, it would be wrong to think that either one was maybe -- to think that they weren\u2019t both good avenues for growth. Christopher Glynn : That makes sense. Yeah. It was kind of meant to particularly drill into the expanding the technical... Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Christopher Glynn : That\u2019s great. And then on C&I, clearly a stronger quarter year-over-year and sequentially versus kind of the trends we have seen in the past few quarters, a little more kind of stable, steady. So wondering if your sense of things getting rolling there versus you kind of got a bit more out the door of this quarter? Nick Pinchuk : No. I don\u2019t, well, we like to think we got bit more out the door. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it. I think, look, I think we are making a little bit of penetration. As I tried to say in our remarks, we are getting better at handling the turbulence. I\u2019d like to say we are not as dumb as we look and a lot of people would say that would be impossible. But we are kind of learning quarter by quarter and C&I has the longest learning curve, because they have the most impact of all this stuff that\u2019s happened. I mean, C&I in Shanghai, there is that one thing -- by the way, we were up in Asia in C&I, so they did pretty well in that regard. So what we are seeing is, we are seeing our ability to manage the turbulence better. We are also seeing some warming, like in this quarter, one of the things that was very encouraged by is that the military wasn\u2019t down as much in the quarter. The military is kind of coming back. It\u2019s still down. You know what I mean, I am still -- I don\u2019t like it, but it\u2019s still -- it\u2019s coming back. So it wasn\u2019t as big of a hole this quarter, as it has been in the past. And also general industry, I don\u2019t know if you saw that comment, general industry was up and aviation in total was up, particularly international aviation believe it or not. So, general industry which implies the widest category for us, in terms of that, that has so many different segments and that was up strongly. So I kind of think the critical industries are coming, getting stronger, recovering from the impact. So we feel pretty good about that. In our business are looking better. Now, that\u2019s why we were particularly pleased about this 7.6% growth organically in C&I. That made us -- that gave us great encouragement. And in reality, the 14.4%, yeah, it was down 140 basis points year-over-year, but 14.4% aren\u2019t chop liver for C&I, it\u2019s not so bad. And was up 100 basis points versus last quarter and down 2020 versus 2019 against the pretty severe impact of acquisitions and currency, I think, it was 80 basis points. So those -- they are points were pretty good for us, we were encouraged by it. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thanks for the color. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We can now take our next question from Gary Prestopino of Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Gary, how are you? Gary Prestopino : Oh! I am just fine. Thanks. Hey, Nick, just a question, as it evolves with all the hybrids and electric vehicles that are starting to come into the car park or a bit in the car park for years now. With your product set there, right now are you seeing demand from technicians for specific hand tools or more diagnostic and calibration tools in the repair of these kinds of vehicles? Nick Pinchuk : I think you see more demand for the diagnostic, but you also see the hand tools. I think, if you look at the -- they are in the car park, but they are -- if you look at -- it\u2019s one thing to look at it versus the sales. If you look at them in the car park, it gets to be pretty thin. You are not seeing -- not that many garages are seeing a lot of them. So the guys are talking to us about this and we sell hand tools and we sell some diagnostics that you have -- it\u2019s not a special diagnostic form, but it\u2019s a diagnostic that would have the capabilities to deal with those things. So you are not seeing -- they are still pretty thinly distributed across unless maybe you are in Southern California or something like that or maybe New York City or some, you might see some of those garages, but we are not seeing huge demand. Mostly we are getting ready for what we think will be the demand going forward. We think this is going to be a tidal wave. And so that\u2019s one of the reasons why we acquired Dealer-FX to get a look at these things. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : We can now take our next question from Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial Partners. Please go ahead. Ivan Feinseth : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on another great quarter and the great results. Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Ivan. Ivan Feinseth : When you were talking about like you bring on a new tool and it sold out pretty quickly, how fast can you ramp up? Is it because you didn\u2019t anticipate the demand would be so strong or you are seeing still dealing with shortages and how quickly can you ramp up for another production run? Nick Pinchuk : I would say, we didn\u2019t expect it to be that big. This one -- the couple -- of course, this is an earnings call, so I pick some of the ringer as you know and I put them on. But the thing is that, those guys blew out the doors and we didn\u2019t anticipate it be that good, otherwise we would have done a bigger run to begin with. So that\u2019s the situation. Just the demand was really high. Now, on top of that, I will tell you that we believe we need more capacity, because we have demand, so we are looking at that situation wise and we will have to go back and try to schedule another run in the handful plants, which is already over scheduled, but we will try to put that in and roll out with some more. Obviously though, if you are do that, I mean, the reason why we are running a hand tool plants, they got a lot of demand. So we see ourselves that sitting on some further opportunities if we can just rollout more product and we are working on it. In terms of expanding the plant we have an expansion plan for our Milwaukee hand tool plants, where this plans was built. Ivan Feinseth : And then as your franchisees interact with OEM mechanics, what kind of feedback or discussions are they having about preparing to ramp up for new tools to handle the EVs that are at some point going to explain... Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. Look, I think, they are having talks about that, but generally you are talking about insulated tool, some of the obvious stuff like some diagnostics stuff, some insulated tools, some lift tables for the batteries, those kinds of things. And then what will happen, Ivan, is the mechanics don\u2019t know yet what they don\u2019t know, you know what I mean, about preparing the tool. Ivan Feinseth : Yeah. Nick Pinchuk : Those new cars get into the dealerships and the mechanics will discover where they need new tools to deal with it. That\u2019s a whole other level of array. So we are talking right now about the common things that you might -- you observe from early days from the -- you hear from the OEMs, are you see the very, very -- very early days in the OEM garages and those are the things that I just talked about like insulated tools and some diagnostics some analysis routines and also some lift tables and other stuff around electric vehicles and then you are going to hear as a guys start repair them, let\u2019s say, geez, these particular vehicles are different, I need a special tool to do this and that\u2019s where we start rolling out our activity we start building more tools to match. That\u2019s a whole other array and that\u2019s one of the thing really takes off for us. Ivan Feinseth : And then I assume you are going to need some kind of new types of lifts to handle the access or battery swapping because of the way is\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : It\u2019s also true -- so true\u2026 Ivan Feinseth : Yeah. It\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Also true. I didn\u2019t mention that, but that\u2019s right\u2026 Ivan Feinseth : And the same thing\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : That\u2019s -- reason I have mentioned is handled by another division. But that\u2019s also true. A lot of this stuff is going to -- the equipment -- the whole equipment line that doesn\u2019t go through the vans is a whole other issue that\u2019s going to need new stuff, because these things are heavy, as you know being a car expert. Ivan Feinseth : Okay. Well, then, I guess, then the same thing is going to hold true for undercarriage and collision, because the way the EVs are structured and the way you have to repair them around the battery and the whole structure eventually is going to be a huge upgrade cycle for undercarriage and collision, right? Nick Pinchuk : Correct. Correct. You got it. That\u2019s right. I mean the batteries are, before I -- I think most people don\u2019t realize, how heavy these batteries are actually. There\u2019s a lot of weight underneath that -- under that chassis. So it\u2019s going to be an issue. It\u2019s going to revolutionize garage I believe as things go out. And again, I want to point out that, the OEMs will figure this out early, but then there will be a lot of unforeseen complications that change it again after your first wave of change. So we are pretty pumped. That\u2019s why I say we are entering the golden age of car repair. Ivan Feinseth : Yeah. Very exciting. Congratulations again and look forward to ongoing success. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to hand the call back to Sara Verbsky for closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note, this call is being recorded. For the duration of the call, your lines will be on listen-only mode. However, you will have an opportunity to ask for questions at the end of the call. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand over the call to your host, Sara Verbsky, to begin the conference. Thank you. Sara Verbsky : Thank you, Caroline, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to review Snap-on's third quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call today, Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we have provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website along with a transcript of today\u2019s call. Any statements made during this call relative to management\u2019s expectations, estimates or beliefs or that otherwise discuss management\u2019s or the company\u2019s outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I\u2019ll start the call by covering the highlights of the third quarter. I\u2019ll give you an update on the environment and the trends we see. I'll take you through some of the turbulence we've encountered, thinking about our performance. Aldo will provide a more detailed [Technical Difficulty] The story of the Snap-on -- apparently we have some cross talk we\u2019re hearing here. But the story of the Snap-on quarter is momentum overcoming challenges. Momentum rooted in the resilience of our market, the capability of our great team and the tactical and strategic advantage in our product, our brand and our models, all coming together to create considerable and ongoing strength. In effect, the third quarter once again demonstrated our ability to continue a trajectory of positive results despite the headwinds, and the numbers, they say it so. Our reported sales in the quarter of $1.125 billion were up $64.8 million or 6.2% versus last year, including $39.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Organic sales grew 10.4%, with gains in every group, our ninth straight quarter of year-over-year expansion. And if you compare it to the pre-pandemic levels of 2029 -- 2019, you see a clear and unmistakable upward drive, versus 2019 sales we're up 3% as reported and 2.8% organically, continuing our positive trend and accelerating our expansion, demonstrating that we're only getting stronger every day. I did say momentum. Quarter also bears the mark of Snap-on value creation processes, safety, a lot of the customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement or RCI. Once again, they all combine to offer significant progress. And progress to what, Opco operating income of $223.5 million increased $22.2 million from last year, and the Opco operating margin was 20.3%, up 90 basis points from last year and rising 170 basis points over 2019. For financial services, operating income of $66.4 million compared to the $70.6 million of last year, a decrease reflecting the forecasted return to more usual provision levels. And that result, combined with Opco for a consolidated margin of 24.4%, up 20 basis points from last year and 120 basis point improvement from 2019. The quarterly EPS, it was $4.14, rising 16% over the $3.57 from a year ago and 39.9% over the $2.96 days recorded in 2019, a significant gain. I said it before, and I'll say it again. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than when we entered this great withering, and the third quarter results are an unmistakable confirmation of that fact. Well, those are the numbers. Now let's speak about the markets. Auto repair continues to remain strong. The key metrics are all favorable, spending on vehicle maintenance repair, the vehicle technician and technician wage is up, up and up again. And so wonder, it's no wonder the repair industry is resilient. Repair spending is rising. The cars are more complex. They need more repairs, and it costs more. The technician count is at its highest point in three decades, and shop owners keep telling me they need more, many more. Wages continue to grow, and they simply reflect the increased demand for the skills that are now necessary to complete critical repair tasks. It's never been more evident that repairing a modern vehicle with the new technology is difficult. It's an exercise of extraordinary skill. And the salaries are rising to show it. Auto repair is resilient. When I meet up with the people at the shop, as I often do, our franchisees and our technician customers, you can feel their exception in the now and their confidence in the future. And they're making sure they can participate in that future by being ready with the tools they need. Vehicle repair, it's a space filled with opportunity. You can hear it in the optimism in the voices of the shop, and you can see it clearly confirmed in Snap-on's performance. But it's not just the text, shop owners are also a big -- shop owners and managers are also big players in the horizon repair. And our Repair Systems and Information group are RS&I is positioned to take advantage. Everybody knows that cars are scarce. New and used. But for Snap-on, that doesn't matter. Repair and collision shops are busy. It's a tool we like very much. And it's evident in the rising sales of our undercar equipment and collision businesses, both strong. You have a repair shop today, you see a bright future with changing technologies, and you want to be ready, new vehicles are being released with a greater variety of drivetrains than ever from internal combustion engines to hybrid to plug-in electric to full electric. And the range of options is growing : more driver assist, more vehicle automation, increasing vehicle complexity, and we're ready to help the repair shops keep pace with powerful products like a range of fast track intelligence diagnostics, the Zeus, the Triton, the Apollo Handheld, enabling repair at all levels, like our celebrated Mitchell 1 ProDemand repair information, our award-winning Tru-Point advanced driver assistant calibration system and our 3D alignment systems like the new Hofmann Geoliner, all representing new technologies, and all wheeled big databases deployed to make work easier in the shop. Vehicle repair looks more promising than ever and Snap-On's position to capitalize. Now let's talk about the critical industries where the Snap-On rolls -- the Snap-On brand rolls out of the garage solving tasks of consequence. This is where commercial industrial C&I operates with our broadest region into international markets, and with the locations impacted the most by the challenges of the day. I mean C&I is headwind headquarters, supply chain disruption rising -- rises in commodity costs, uncertain fuel supply, currency fluctuations, continuing COVID lockdowns, troubled economies and war in Ukraine, well, C&I had it all. But it rolls to the occasion. And in the quarter, the group took some lumps in Europe, but over came with strong gains in North America and in Asia, despite the difficulties. And while the military sector is still down, C&I's critical industries -- the other C&I critical industries are all showing life. So I describe our C&I markets as challenged in certain geographies but demonstrating continuing gains and having strong and ongoing possibilities going forward. And coupled with our auto repair related businesses, we believe there is clear and compelling opportunity along our runways for growth, enhancing the band network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industries and building in emerging markets. And in this quarter, we've seen that potential pay off nicely. At the same time, it's clear that we have ongoing possibilities on our runways for improvement. The Snap-On Value Creation processes. They've never been more important, helping to counter the turbulence of the day. Especially important is with customer connection, understanding the work of professional technicians and innovation, matching that insight with technology, driving new products. And just this quarter, Snap-On was prominently recognized with five PTEN, Professional Tool & Equipment News innovation awards. And we were also honored with two MOTOR Magazine Top Tool awards. An essential driver of our growth is innovative products that make work easier, and the awards, hard one. Our testimony that great Snap-On products just keep coming, matching the growing complexity of the task becoming more essential to technicians and driving our positive results. Now let's turn to the segments. In the C&I group. Sales in the quarter of $356.8 million were up 1.5% or $5.4 million as reported versus 2021, including a $26.2 million or 7.9% organic uplift, operating progress across all divisions, which was offset partially by $20.8 million in unfavorable foreign currency. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income of $52.3 million, including $2.1 million of unfavorable currency represents a decrease of $1.3 million compared to 2021. The effects of volume gains were more than offset by the substantial impact of currency and by supply chain inefficiencies. The OI margin was 14.7%, down from last year, but still representing the highest level since the rise of the significant supply turbulence. Compared with the pre-pandemic level, sales were up 7.7% organically, and the OI margin of 14.7% was up 30 basis points despite a 60 basis point negative impact of acquisitions, and unfavorable currency. Now we remain committed to extending in critical industries, the C&I sweet spot, and we'll keep strengthening our position to capture those opportunities as they arise and enabling that intent is our expanding C&I lineup of innovative products, designed specifically to make critical work easy. One example is our brushless CT9015 18-volt drill. It's newest member of our Monster, the lithium family aimed at industrial manufacturing and repair professionals, enabling work with the toughest materials, 470-inch pounds of torque, enough to handle even hardened alloys, 2,000 RPMs, speed to get the job done quickly. And with heavy duty \u2013 with the heavy-duty gearing and the enhanced cooling, this tool is rugged, durable, even in extreme use. The 9015 also offers an 18-speed clutch, a variable speed trigger, a two-speed gearbox, all for precise control, a feature that's essential for serious drilling, for professional drilling. And the 18-volt battery with 5 watt-hour ensures consistent output and extended run time in effect, less charging for a more efficient workday. Tools also fitted with a 100 lumen head light, helping technician work \u2013 helping technicians work in dark environments just what's needed for those coal sub jobs. The CT9015 has got power, speed, precision and durability. It's a great tool and a text know it. They've already made the new drill one of our $1 million hit products. So that's C&I., continued progress against the turbulence. Now on to the Tools Group. The team just keeps driving upward, leaving the pre-pandemic levels behind by a wider distance every quarter. Sales of $496.6 million were up $25.2 million or 5.3% over 2021. Organic growth of $34.1 million, or 7.4%, partially offset by $8.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency. The operating margin was 20.6%, down slightly, 20 basis points, but overcoming a 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Compared with pre-virus 2019, sales were $111.4 million or 28.9%, including a $113 million or 29.5% organic gain, and this quarter's 20.6% operating margin was up 680 basis points versus 2019, coming out of the pandemic stronger indeed. The Tools Group is responding to the challenges of the day, increasing its product advantage, fortifying its brands, further enabling the franchisees, guiding them to more selling capacity, and it's all working. You can witness it in any time you meet the franchisees. One big opportunity for that is our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, or SFC, held this year at the Gaylord Texan Hotel in Dallas. The theme was breaking barriers. It's a reminder of our record franchisee performance driving ever upward over the last nine quarters, and it's a recognition of the clear opportunity to reach even greater heights going forward, almost \u2013 yes, almost 8,000 individuals attended. And I can tell you, they were pumped, excited by the products more than three football fields of our latest offerings were on display, all available for viewing, handling and ordering in order they did, setting new records that we can also offer a variety of training seminars, where franchisees were able to sharpen and expand their skills to selling the full range of our complex and broad product line. It's an important movement. We say we're working to expand the selling capacities are advance, the SFC is a big part of that effort, and Dallas was another great step forward to that end. You can bet. You can bet on it. Our entire team departed this year's get together and Dallas educated, energized and eager to extend the Snap-on difference, reaching new individual and collective levels of success throughout the base to come. They left excited and strong. The Dallas SFC will lead to breaking barriers. The franchisees' enthusiasm for their businesses and their confidence in their future will make it so. During the SFC, the Tools Group presented the newest addition to the Snap-on ratchet lineup, our FLLF80, a three-inch drive extra-long locking flex-head ratchet. This new innovation provides easy access to superior turning power. Our patented duality technology makes it stronger. And the 20-inch length, the longest in the category, provides even greater -- provides great ability to reach deeper in a crowded spaces, extending reach and increasing leverages. It's a great addition to any toolbox. And as an added bonus, the new patent-pending, self-cleaning feature vanishes dirt and grind ensuring that the flex-head locks firmly in place at even -- at any angle even under high-stress applications. The X80 is a special offering, access, leverage and stability in one rachet. The initial launch exceeded $1 million is to hit product and sales. And volume continues to move forward upward on a steep trajectory beyond product. We spend time working to expand the franchisee selling capacity, harnessing social media, improving product training, RCI and the van operations. It's been effective. So capacity is clearly on the rise. And you can see it in the results. The Tools Group is on a very positive trend, ascending and leaving pre-pandemic levels well behind. And as we said in the SFC, it's breaking new barriers right now, and we believe it will all continue. Now on to RS&I. Sales were sales of $414 million, were up $14.9 [ph] million or 13.6%, including $60.8 million or 17.2% organic uplift. Growth was weighted toward undercar equipment and sales for the OEM dealerships, but our information and diagnostics businesses were also players in the year-over-year improvement. RCI, RS&I operating earnings were $95.4 million, representing a $12.1 million increase versus 2021, and the operating margin was up 10 basis points from last year to 23%. Compared with 2019, sales grew $91.3 million or $0.82, including an $86 million or 27.2% organic gain. Operating margin was down 20 [ph] basis points versus 2019, primarily reflecting the business mix and the acquisitions. But at 23%, it was still strong. We see significant potential in our size runways for growth, expanding Snap-on's presence in garage with coherent acquisitions and with a broad array of powerful products, and the industry experts feel the same. In fact, our TRITON D10, Fast Track intelligence diagnostic units was just selected for amazing top two award and rightly so. The trend is ideal deal for shop owners and for general technicians, it provides a comprehensive system verification to identify troubled areas, and to diagnostic testing to pinpoint repair actions and a powerful lab scope to confirm component level functionality, all in one package. The D10 advanced scoping -- the D10's advanced scoping capability helps users dig deep into the vehicle systems and evaluate performance with the comparative data, and it's Fast Track intelligent diagnostics, greatly shortcut the work and streamlines the repair processes, making shops more productive, more profitable. Unit also offers a rugged hardware explicitly designed for -- you expect this from Snap-on. The unit also offers rugged hardware explicitly designed for shop environments -- tough shop environment, a super-fast, two-second boot-up, and a 10-inch touchscreen. It all comes together for unprecedented reliability and speed and ease of use. It's a -- I'm telling you, the technicians will tell you, it's a [indiscernible] product. And with the selection of the TRITON motor magazine -- and with the selection of the TRITON, motor magazines, now recognized Snap-on diagnostic units in 22 of the last 23 years. 22 of the last 23 years, we believe it's more testimony that RS&I is stronger than ever in shops and dealerships. Well, that's the highlights for our quarter. Tools Group, strong progress. C&I recording a positive performance and an upward trajectory against the variations across industries and geographies. And RS&I, expanding profitable volume with repair shop owners and managers, staff on overall sales rising again, 10.4% and 22.8% organically versus last year and the pre-pandemic level, respectively, continuing clear and positive growth. OpCo operating margins, a robust 20.3% rising again this quarter, up 90 basis points. EPS, $4.14 up versus last year and accelerated well beyond pre-pandemic levels. It was another encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Al. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide six. Net sales of $1.125 billion in the quarter increased 6.2% from 2021 levels, reflecting the 10.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $39.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain this quarter reflects high single-digit growth in both the Snap-on Tools Group and the Commercial Industrial Group and double-digit gains in the repair systems and information group. This growth compares to the 8.4% year-over-year organic increase recorded last quarter. From a geographic perspective, continued sales strength in the United States and several emerging markets more than offset weaker demand in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48.3% declined 190 basis points from 50.2% last year. Higher material and other costs were partially offset by contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions as well as benefits from the company's RCI initiatives, and 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Again, this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing, and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 28%, improved 280 basis points from 30.8% last year. The improvement is primarily due to sales volume leverage and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings from -- before financial services of $223.5 million in the quarter compared to $201.3 million in 2021. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 20.3% improved 90 basis points from last year. Financial services revenue of $87.3 million in the third quarter of 2022 was unchanged from last year. Operating earnings of $66.4 million decreased $4.2 million from 2021 levels, primarily as a result of higher provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $289.9 million compared to $271.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 24.4%, compared to 24.2% in 2021. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 21.6%, compared to 23.7% last year. The lower rate in the quarter was primarily due to tax benefits realized from the favorable settlements of income tax audits. Net earnings of $223.9 million or $4.14 per diluted share increased $27.7 million or $0.57 per share from last year's levels, representing a 16% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $356.8 million increased from $351.4 million last year, reflecting a $26.2 million or 7.9% organic sales gain, partially offset by $20.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segment to Asia Pacific operations and specialty torque business as well as a low single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. Lower activity with the military was more than offset by gains in aviation, mining, power generation as well as in oil and gas. Gross margin of 36.9% declined 130 basis points from 38.2% in the third quarter of 2021. This is primarily due to increased material and other input costs, partially offset by benefits from the higher sales volumes and pricing actions and 20 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.2% in the quarter improved 70 basis points from 22.9% in 2021, primarily due to the effects of sales volume leverage. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $52.3 million, compared to $53.6 million last year, the operating margin of 14.7%, compared to 15.3% a year ago. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $496.6 million increased 5.3% from $471.4 million in 2021, reflecting a 7.4% organic sales gain, partially offset by $8.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a high single-digit gain in our US business, which was partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in our international operations, the latter largely reflecting weakness in the United Kingdom. Gross margin of 44.9% in the quarter declined 90 basis points from 45.8% last year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to higher material and other costs, and 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by benefits from increased sales volumes and the pricing actions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24.3% improved 70 basis points from 25% last year, reflecting the benefits from higher sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $102.2 million compared to $98.2 million last year. The operating margin of 20.6% compared to 20.8% in 2021 and to 13.8% in the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide nine. Sales of $414 million compared to $364.4 million a year ago, reflecting a 17.2% organic sales gain, partially offset by $11.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in activity with OEM dealerships, and in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment, and a low single-digit gain sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 42.9% declined 390 basis points from 46.8% last year. This is primarily due to higher material and other input costs and increased sales and lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 19.9% improved 400 basis points from 23.9% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $95.4 million compared to $83.3 million last year. The operating margin of 23% improved 10 basis points from 22.9% reported a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $87.3 million, including $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation was unchanged from last year. Financial services operating earnings of $66.4 million, including $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $70.6 million in 2021. Financial services expenses of $20.9 million were up $4.2 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $3.7 million of increased provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus the historically lower provision rate experienced last year, we believe that loan portfolio trends remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 0.9% and 0.8% in the third quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, respective average yields on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.8%. In the third quarters of 2022 and 2021, the average yields on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. The blended yield for the portfolio was 15.8% in the third quarter of 2022, which is the same as last year. Total loan originations of $300.2 million in the third quarter increased to $30.9 million or 11.5% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 12.5% increase in originations of finance receivables and an 8% increase in originations of contract receivables. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.2 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our US operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for the United States extended credit compared to 1.4% in 2021 and 1.7% in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the second and third quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $42.2 million represented 2.41% of outstandings at quarter end, and were down 7 basis points as compared to the same period last year. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $129.9 million in the quarter, compared to $186.4 million last year. The decrease from the third quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a $63.5 million increase in working investment. The change in working investment dollars is largely driven by greater demand, resulting in increased receivables and higher levels of inventory this year. In addition to demand-based requirements, the inventory increase also reflects higher in-transit inventory amounts as well as incremental buffer stocks associated with the supply chain dynamics in the current macro environment. Net cash used by investing activities of $57.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $38.2 million and capital expenditures of $20 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $120.7 million included cash dividends of $75.7 million and the repurchase of 228,000 shares of common stock for $50.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $396 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $56.7 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end. Inventories increased $151.3 million from 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.6 compared to 2.8 at year-end 2021 and 2.6 as of the pre-pandemic third quarter of 2019. Our quarter end cash position of $759.3 million compared to $380 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 9.3% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no outstanding amounts under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for the remainder of 2022. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to US tax legislation, that our full year 2022 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll turn the call back over to Nick now for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, it was quite a quarter. A staggering number of media pieces have exhaustively documented the modern-day hydro turbulence that marks this period. So we all know the challenges are many, and they're substantial. But despite the headwinds, Snap-on stayed on the train, and that momentum shines through in the quarter across all our groups, all of them. C&I, growing 7.9% organically, extending its position in the critical with robust gains in North America and Asia Pacific, overcoming the variations in Europe, registering an OI margin of 14.7%, the strongest since the supply chain disruptions began in earnest, demonstrating continuing progress. The Tools Group. We believe the franchise network is stronger and more capable than ever. Sales up 7.4% organically. OI margins 20.6%, down 20 points, but against 40 basis points of unfavorable currency and representing a rise of 680 basis points above 2019. RS&I aggressively expanding with repair shop owners and managers, growing organically 17.2% over last year and 27.2% over the pre-virus era. And the OI margin was a strong 23%, and it all ends up to ongoing and ongoing upward trend for the corporation. Activity rising 10.4% organically versus last year and up 22.8%, compared with 2019. OI margin for the corporation was 20.2%, up 90 basis points from last year and 170 basis points above the pre-pandemic level. And one final testimony you know, straight. The EPS was $4.14, a significant gain of 16% versus 2021 and 39.9% over 2019. It was an encouraging quarter, and we are convinced it's an extremely promising future. You see, we believe that the resilience of our markets, co-authored by critical tasks and changing technologies will drive opportunity against the win. We believe that our strength in customer connection and innovative products and in the special power of our brand, will position Snap-on to fully participate in those possibilities. We believe that the considerable capability of our experienced team can navigate to any turbulence, and we believe that these are unique advantages that will maintain our substantial momentum, breaking barrier after barrier, reaching new highs through the remainder of this year on into 2023 and well beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening in. The encouraging performance, we detailed here today, was made possible only by your individual and your efforts and your collective actions for your extraordinary success in authoring another strong Snap-on quarter, you have my congratulations. For the unique skills and capabilities you're display and overcoming the challenges of these days, you have my aberration, and for your unwavering confidence in our future and your continuing commitment to our team, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Sara Verbsky : Caroline, can we take our first question? Operator : Yes. Sure. So we will take the first question from line of Gary from Barrington. The line is open now. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Hi, good morning, everyone. Hey, a couple of things here. Could you, first of all, quantify how much currency impacted EPS this quarter? Aldo Pagliari : It was $0.09, Gary. Nick Pinchuk : $0.09. $0.09. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. And then Nick, you mentioned that there was some pretty good robust order flow out of the conference that you had this year. Can you maybe give us a quantifiable range of what that was year-over-year? And then where was there really particular interest in the part of the franchisees and specific Tool Groups? Was it storage, diagnostic, just general households, whatever. Nick Pinchuk : I'll tell you that I had heard like somebody mentioned double-digits versus last year. But look, I want to quickly say, these are orders. They're not sales, people order. And so we had a pretty robust number. And I don't like to say the real amount here, the exact number, it was pretty good. It's dangerous to extrapolate because they are orders. But orders of that level are better than the point eye with a sharp stick, I'll tell you that. So, we feel pretty good about this. Where it was ordered, I think tool storage was terrific in this quarter. Hand tools were very strong. And the big packs did pretty well. Big packs are kind of a comprehensive thing that people order. So, we saw in those categories. I think everything did pretty well, but the big ticket items were kind of good in this particular quarter. -- SFC as they were in the quarter, big ticket items were strong enough. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then you're kind of breaking up there, but I think-- Nick Pinchuk : I'll say it again. Big orders. They were big order, something like double-digit, they are order. And secondly, generally, I think if you ask me to make a couple -- I think the big ticket items were pretty strong for us. And -- but generally, we have these things, Gary, called big packs where franchisees order comprehensive arrays of tools, hand tools and so on and so they were also pretty strong. So, hand tools are pretty good. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then just one last one, if I may. In terms of diagnostics, your diagnostic tools at this point, fairly drive train agnostic, or do you actually have a specialized diagnostic product that is just systemic to electric vehicles. Nick Pinchuk : No, no, no. We would probably not do that. We would probably have -- we would put them in -- we would put all types of drivetrains in one tool. We wouldn't necessarily have one because you do it now. You have hybrids and you have -- you'd have -- you have anything in the product. The beauty of the diagnostic unit is you can repair anything. So, part of the idea is you plug it in, no matter what the car is, the model, the make, the type of thing. And so you try to have that in terms of comprehension around, in that situation. And we have the best -- we are the best, certainly in terms of comprehensive data. Coverage is-- Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, sure. Gary Prestopino : Thank you so much. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. We will take the next question from line of Bret Jordan from Jefferies. The line is open now, please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey good morning guys. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning. Bret Jordan : Nick, you talked about RCI opportunities at the van level, I think, in the prepared remarks. Could you talk about maybe in greater detail what you're doing there? Nick Pinchuk : Well, there's a couple of things. I mean one of the things we're getting better at applying social media. So, the idea behind social media, it's a big RCI opportunity because of the better we can pre-brief the customers. So, when we enter the shops, the customer kind of knows the product, he knows the -- and we have a lot of promotions. So, he knows the promotion. So, the franchisee can spend his limited time with that particular individual, customizing why those characteristics mean a lot to them, and he can use them. And so that is really one huge thing. It's one of the things that we're getting better at day-by-day, but it has driven some of our capabilities in those kinds of situations. There's other things in terms of collections, in terms of taking inventories on the vans in terms of adjusting the computer system. So, it's easier to use and quicker those kinds of things in ways in which they can status their orders, which is a big deal these days because you've got a lot of people clamoring for product, and they're looking for it. So those are the kinds of things. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then, Aldo, a quick question on the financial services. You've mentioned sort of higher provisions. Could you talk about maybe what you're seeing and a cadence of what you're seeing as far as the credit books, are the mechanics -- I mean, obviously, the wage growth has been great, but is there sort of broader pressure on the credit side. Aldo Pagliari : Bret, good question. We actually saw exceptionally strong performance in 2020, 2021. You read about it from other people as well that people service their debt in a more aggressive fashion, bringing it down and people were more current than ever in servicing debt. So we had unusually low provisions in 2021 and in 2020, in the back half of 2020. What you see now is kind of a return to a more normal pace. And even in the quarter, based on comparing it to 2017, 2018, 2019, the rate of provision is still less than that era. So in the quarter, they're performing well. I mean, it's a very typical performance that we're seeing. And all the leading indicators still give rise to the fact that we think we'll do okay in the credit company. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take the next question from the line of Scott Stember from MKM Partners. The line is open now, please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Can you talk about sell-in to the channel, the van channel versus sell-out? Is it fair to assume that things are pretty much one for one, or was there any coming\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : Yeah. In each quarter, it varies from time to time, but this quarter was sort of right on, pretty much the same. Maybe even, yeah, I'd say, right on, maybe even a little better, but not -- for government work, you can say, sell-in and sell-out was about the same. Scott Stember : All right. And then, RS&I, you talked about undercar equipment. Can you maybe give a little more granularity? Was that related to collision repair, or was that just everything? Nick Pinchuk : Actually, everything is sell-in for undercar. It's one of the things that derive -- the collision repair is a star in this era. I think it's driven by the idea that collision, the cars now has that neural network of sensors. So every time -- if you just dent bumper, it's thousands of dollars of repair, because you've got to recalibrate everything and so on. So collision shops got to upgrade to take advantage of that to be actually be able to effectively, not only restore shape but put things back into operating performance. But also, the other businesses we're selling via the other products like lifts, just basic lifts, which you would think would be the most vanilla of products in the situation are selling quite well. So I think it's on collisions shops, as the situation, but also repair shops in general are seeing the future, and they are pumped about this. Like I said, I think even the dealerships are starting to get over the idea, they don't have cars to sell and are turning to repair. Scott Stember : Got it. And just last question. Obviously, you guys have put up some stellar results the last couple of years, but the uncertainty for next year with a recession. Could you just give us an idea of what we should look out for a potential canary in the coal mine that we need to look at that will give us an early warning sign? Nick Pinchuk : Well, first of all, I have to say, though, I think when you walk in the garage, you don't hear a recession. It's like when you watch the -- when you watch the programs like Score Box [ph] in the morning, every 10 words are recession -- every 10th word is for recession. You don't hear that in the factories of the -- among the people of work. You just don't hear it. They're really robust about this. But -- if you're talking about canary in the coal mine, if you looked at the last -- each one is different. But certainly, the last ordinary recession that wasn't open. You would see a reduction maybe in bigger ticket items perhaps, because of the confidence in the future. Generally, repair needs to go on. It's essentially doing it, but people might be packing to shorter payback items and longer payback items when they're a little more uncertain about the future. That happens in the financial recession. Now as it turns out in the quarter, our big ticket items were robust. Scott Stember : Got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We will take the next question from line of Luke Junk from Baird. The line is open now. Please go ahead. Luke Junk : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, Nick, just curious to get your perspective on investment in posture of the company given the macro backdrop, thinking, especially with regards to maintaining the momentum that you've got in the Tools Group right now. And as we look outside the Tools Group as well, it's just some of the key considerations around investment if we do get into a choppier macro in RS&I and C&I as well? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look, I don't think, and I now have been -- I've been through two big downturns; one, the financial recession, and two, the COVID, if you can call it. And I don't remember restricting our investment in the business. I do not remember that. If we wanted to do it, if we thought it was important for the future, if these was efficacious for our customers, we were able to do it. Because Snap-on, maybe you get a little -- you're off the bubble a little bit, but we've never really been restricted in a recession. And those are two big ones, two big wins. And so I don't anticipate doing that. I anticipate our ability to keep investing in the business. We might tighten our belt in terms of travel and things, other things people do. But if you're talking about investing in a business, we said last time, we kept going, we kept investing in product and brand and people. We didn't lay anybody off. And that's what we did. And that's why we came out of the reception stronger. So we do the same thing. Luke Junk : Okay. Thanks for that. Really a question around margins and profitability going into next year. And the question is around recovering price cost, clearly, we can see the impacts of higher material prices and other costs in the quarter here in 3Q. And I'm just wondering, as we turn the page to next year, especially in C&I, where I know your ability to recover cost real time is limited just given the nature of the customers and the contracts, how you're positioning going into those conversations next year. And then also in the Tools Group, of course, just how much price elasticity do you think there is in that business today? Nick Pinchuk : I think we certainly -- let me take the Tools Group first. I think there's -- and Tools Group, I said many times, we control the customer interface. We believe we can price for visible inflation. We were pretty satisfied, we were pretty encouraged by this quarter. Third quarter -- I've said this like in 15 third quarters that I've been on this call, it's always squarely. So the idea is -- I thought the Tools Group had a great -- a very encouraging third quarter, especially against the currency, and being up over 2019. If you come to C&I, yes, it's a little bit more viscous in terms of pricing. But if you look at C&I, I think we thought 7.9% up organically. It's pretty good. It's starting to break out of the problem and the 14.7% OI margin, while down year-over-year is the highest since we actually started getting this turbulence. So we see -- when we step back on it, we see C&I fighting against these turbulences, both geographically and sector-wise. But we see them winning the war and moving forward, and we would consider that to happen. If you look at cost overall, generally, there's a lot of variation in this, but steel cost -- for example, some steel costs are down now. So you're going to start seeing that versus last year. Others are down versus the peak, but not down versus last year. So you're going to see variation going forward, but it's got to be an easing of the situation, at least a more positive situation. The worry about C&I is the ability of getting things and getting them delivered when you have those hundred tool -- 100-unit complex kits to deliver, and you have to have them all in place before you send out the kit. And so that can be devil C&I. That's the major battle for them. But I feel pretty confident about the situation. I think things are getting better. Luke Junk : Thanks to that. And then if I can sneak it in, just a quick question for Aldo, on the credit business. And what I'm hoping -- I already got a question on this, but I just want to ask it a little bit differently in terms of parsing out decrease in credit income, especially the provision-related impacts on a year-over-year basis. Can you just help us understand the moving pieces there between mechanical moving pieces as things normalize post COVID, and separately changes in your assumptions around underlying credit that's driving the change? Just trying to square that with what are clearly still very low delinquency rates. Thank you. Aldo Pagliari : I would just say at the highest level -- look, I'd say a way to look back that. When the world broke into the era of COVID, there was a lot of trepidation as to what does that mean. And looking backwards, you probably have a period, including Snap-on, where we over reserved and the provisions were probably higher than that was necessary. And as a result of that, when you actually see the proof as it played out, that you didn't require those, you had been a need for lower provisions in 2021. And now you're starting to get back to what I call a more normal pace of activity. And if you look at the portfolio itself, it's got a little bit better credit characteristics. What I mean by that is maybe $1 of conservatism on the part of who we granted credit to, so it's less high-risk candidates in the pool. And people's FICA scores have improved marginally. So again, at a macro 30,000-foot level, there's probably a slightly less amount of credit risk in the portfolio. And therefore, as you go forward in these trends, I think it's kind of getting back to norm for lack of a better word, with that macro backdrop that Nick just described. Luke Junk : Okay. Great. Thank you for that following-up. Operator : Thank you. We will take the last question from David MacGregor. The line is open now. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me, okay? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, I can hear you. David MacGregor : All right, wonderful. Hi, Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Hi. How are you doing? David MacGregor : I guess -- I am doing well, thanks. I hope you are as well. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, we are doing okay. David MacGregor : Good stuff. I wanted to just build on that last question. And a question with respect to the tools segment. And you reported 7.4% growth. And to the extent that you are sort of maintaining pace with inflation, that would suggest that the bulk of that was pricing, and volume might have been up kind of low single-digit kind of numbers. And so I guess... Nick Pinchuk : That's not \u2013 but okay. Go ahead. David MacGregor : But we'll start with that. Yes, go ahead. Go ahead. Nick Pinchuk : No. I -- we don't think -- we think pricing ends up being around -- we do a list price, but the list prices don't all flow, and then we've got the -- it doesn't all hold. And then we've got the promotions, which go out and some of them are leaner and some of them are more rich. And so you have that. And then you've got new products that are rolling through the system and they get repriced. So when we look -- we all said and done, we would say that tools may be getting half of that in price or maybe a little bit less. That's the way we see it. It doesn't -- you can't really just look at the list price because it gets so complicated in looking at that. But our best guess is that it's around that number. So okay, you see -- okay. Yes, it's not 7.4% volume growth, but it's certainly not zero. David MacGregor : Sure. No, I understand. So, if we assume maybe prices is maybe 300 basis points and you got 400 basis points -- Nick Pinchuk : Maybe. David MacGregor : Yes, sounds like it. And then you got 400 basis points of volume growth. And it sounds like from what you said earlier in the call that inventory on the trucks was pretty stable, but it was pretty even growth between the wholesale and the retail I guess I'm just trying to reconcile the 11% originations growth, which suggests that big ticket was up very, very large. And the implication of that would be that maybe smaller ticket or hand tools was mathematically a negative number, but maybe I'm misunderstanding that. Nick Pinchuk : David, yes, that's cool, but that's not true. The thing is that remember, you got pricing also rolling through those things year-over-year, the same way you did that calculation on the overall number, you got some of that. But tool storage was strong. But you've got other small ticket items. You've got power tools, you got, what we call shop-in tech, which is a myriad of other things that we might sell like lights and pressure gauges and things like that. And so you have a lot of things that go to that. But if you want to pinpoint on hand tools, I'll tell you hand tools is good in the quarter, up double-digits again. So, generally, the core products were okay. The things that are normal. That's what happened in that situation. David MacGregor : Okay. Thanks for addressing that. Sorry, go ahead. Nick Pinchuk : No. No, no. Go ahead. Go ahead. I'm trying to answer your question. Go ahead. David MacGregor : Sure. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of -- within your credit business, I don't think there's ever really many serious questions about the quality of credit in this portfolio. You guys have always done a fantastic job of managing that, and I expect that will be the case going forward. Could you foresee any circumstances whatsoever where you would consider lowering what you charge on extended credit from that 17%, 18% yield to something that's maybe a little more a little more accessible for service for all these... Nick Pinchuk : We always think about these things, David. We review it all the time. But in reality, we've kind of held there, and it's worked for us for a long time. And so I think we are -- we think it's appropriate for the credit profile of the people we deal with. And so we haven't changed anything in that macro in a long time. So, when you look back and you look at the performance of the credit company, it really isn't marked by major changes in the core model. It's generally been the same. Now, it isn't that we don't review it or anything, but I don't think we're seeing ourselves do that right now anyway. David MacGregor : Yes, good. Thanks for addressing my questions. Appreciate it. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Okay. End of Q&A: Sara Verbsky : And that was our final question. Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-On. Good day.",

Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website.  With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Wow, it's been some year and quite a quarter. China knee jerking from Zero COVID and strict lockdowns to living with COVID in unprecedented virus explosion, diminished but still continuing spikes in the supply chain, the ongoing Ukraine war, the emergence of -- the reemergence of Brexit and now the rising shadow of the recession, echoing in almost daily public pronouncements. And thru it all, Snap-on delivered another in a long line of encouraging performances.  We'll go through it. Starting with the highlights of the quarter and the year, I'll give you my perspective on the results, the market environment and our progress. And after that, Aldo will move into -- as usual, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials.  The fourth quarter was encouraging. We believe it emphatically demonstrates the continuing resilience of our markets and the capability of our operations to achieve in the face of difficulty, wielding the power of our product our brand, our people and our strategic position. It all combines to serve as clear evidence of what we already know. Snap-on is a unique and extraordinary operation. The results for the fourth quarter serve as more testimony to that fact, and they are an unmistakable demonstration of our continuing momentum. Of course, we did with the differences from group to group and within the operations, but we believe the overall results are compelling.  Fourth quarter sales of $1.159 billion as reported, up 4.3% from 2021 included a substantial impact from unfavorable foreign currency of $37.7 million a 370 basis point headwind, and an organic sales increase of 8% over last year, and that represented a 22.7% rise over 2019. This now represents the corporation's tenth consecutive quarter above prepandemic levels. It's a trend of, I think, some significance in uncertain times like these. From an earnings perspective, our opco operating income for the quarter, including the impact from unfavorable foreign currency was $248 million, up 6.8% compared to 2021 and 44.7% above the 2019 pre-pandemic level. The OI margin for the quarter, it was 21.5%, improving by 50 basis points over last year and 360 basis points over 2019. It's the same resiliency that's been demonstrated over the years as we paid dividends every quarter since 1939 without a single interruption or reduction. In fact, in November, our dividend was raised by 14.1%, marking the 13th straight year of increases. It's more a testimony of Snap-on's consistent performance through varying environments. This is just another one of them.  For Financial Services, operating income of $63.9 million was down from 67 point -- $63.9 million was down from the $67.2 million in 2021. That decrease reflected the forecasted -- our forecast to return to more historical provision levels, but all the while keeping delinquencies flat to last year. And our overall quarterly EPS reached $4.42, $0.32 or 7.8% above 2021 and up 43.5% compared with 2019. Well, those are the numbers. Now to the markets. We believe that automotive repair remains very favorable. It makes sense. The average age of vehicles continue to increase. The complexity of repairs is rising steeply as new platforms enter the vehicle park, and enter they have, starting in dealerships. And we have seen a resurgence in dealership projects despite a still recovering supply chain. Changes in internal combustion, the rise of electric vehicles and the expansion of vehicle autonomy have made dealerships eager for new equipment to support complex repair test of the evolving vehicle park, and we see it.  Projects and powertrains aside, dealerships continue to see healthy demand in repair and maintenance and in warranty, driving the need for shop expansion and more technicians. You can see it in the macros. Repair spending, technician numbers, technician wages, all up. Our dealership segment is expanding. And for independent repair shops, confidence remains sky high across the board. Shop owners and managers confirm that demand for repairs for technicians over complex skills are all rising, and our sales growth in that sector mirrors that enthusiasm. We believe we're moving into what we can be called the golden age of vehicle repair, and our Tools Group and RS&I group are uniquely positioned with the product, the brand and the people to take full advantage, even in the midst of turbulence. You can see it. Now for the critical industries, where our Commercial & Industrial Group, or C&I operates. We continue to see progress but the group spans wide jurisdictions. And as such, various headwinds across the geographies and the industries have attenuated some of those gains. For geographies, Europe with the war and the reemergence of Brexit and China impacted by the COVID chaos were a stark contrast to relatively strong North American markets, a lot of variation. And the range in variability among sectors also continue to be a challenge. Natural resources, heavy-duty fleets, general industries and international aviations were robust, but the military area remain challenged. Overall, however, order demand for most of the critical industries has been strong, and we believe that's a great signal for C&I's future. So C&I does have challenges across geographies and the segments, but we have made advancements, and we see opportunities for tomorrow.  Going forward, we believe we'll keep moving down our runways for growth, our wide runways for growth. And as we proceed, we're also fortified, as all of you have heard before, by our Snap-on Value Creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI. They're the core processes that drive our ongoing progress, especially customer connection and innovation, growing our product line. You see, our franchisees and our direct sales force puts us in a strategic advantage, standing face-to-face with professional techs, understanding their individual challenges, showcasing the solutions created by our powerful product and demonstrating their use.  Our resilient markets do represent a significant opportunity, and we are there to take advantage up close and personal, like no one else, right where the jobs are done. And it's working. 2022 was a year of substantial headwinds, but our team prevailed with the year achieving new heights. Sales up $4 billion, $492.8 million, up 5.7%, reflecting an organic gain of 8.7% compared to 2021 and a 20.2% organic increase versus 2019. The opco margin for the year was 20.9%, up 90 basis points from '21 and exceeding the prepandemic margins by 170 basis points. As reported, earnings per share for the year were $16.82, up 12.7% from '21 and represented a rise of 35.5% from 2019. It's all evidence of the decisive and ongoing momentum that marked the year and the quarter.  Now the operating groups. Let's start with C&I. Fourth quarter sales of million for the group were down $15.5 million versus last year, including $21.2 million in unfavorable currency and a 1.7% organic gain. Our Specialty Tools division was a clear positive with double-digit gains. Precision is becoming essential every day, and our toric products are putting us right in the middle of that rise. Our critical industries also showed strength, especially in North America, propelled by growth in natural resources, general and heavy duty, partially attenuated by lower military activity. Outside North America, it was a different story. SNA Europe was down and China was diminished. OI for C&I was $47.9 million, down $2.2 million primarily from the $2.3 million in unfavorable foreign currency. The group's operating margin was 14%. It was flat to last year, but still represented an advance of 120 basis points over the pre-pandemic level in 2019, and that was against 50 basis points of negative currency and acquisition dilution. The specialty torque business within C&I really is making significant strides. Torque is hot, and Snap-on is a widening array of new offerings to prominently participate in that trend. Products like our new series of digital torque checkers. It's from our Norbar engineering team. You might remember we acquired Norbar a few years ago. Our Norbar engineering team in England, more compact and easier to use, it helps technicians validate the accuracy of torque instruments close to the workplace, saving a lot of time.  Our new checkers accommodate torque measurements from 5-inch pounds to 1,500 foot pounds and rent is from a quarter inch to 1-inch covering jobs from precision fasteners and a jet cockpit to a heavy-duty bolt on a giant oil rig, a wide range of applications. And it's compact steel how they easily mount in a variety -- this is compact steel housing easily mounts in a variety of convenient locations at the point of issuing or in the pathway of the workflow, like tool cribs, aviation hangars and manufacturing cells, making torque checking an easy exercise.  With an accuracy of plus or minus 1%, our new checker increases process quality without work interruption, raises consistency in assembly activity and, with a streamlined documentation feature, greatly improves the management of fastening in any application. The initial launch was well received by any operation that relies on precision torque, and there are a lot of them. And as you can imagine, the new checker is right on track to be a Snap-on hit product with sales of $1 million in the first year. So it looks like it's a pretty strong product for us. C&I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds, but it did have significant areas of improvement paving the way for future growth.  Now on to the Tools Group. Quarterly sales of $542.7 million, up $37.9 million, including 9.5% in unfavorable currency and a 9.6% organic increase, gains in the U.S. operation and continued expansion in the international networks. And it was all led by big ticket items, tool storage and diagnostics both with double-digit gains. Operating earnings for the Tools Group were $116.1 million in the quarter, $5.6 million above 2021, and that included $4.5 million in unfavorable currency. The operating margin was 21.4%, 50 basis points below last year, but that was impacted by currency and by product mix, but it was still a result of considerable strength.  Tools Group again represents the ongoing power and market leadership of our van network. It's written across the financials. And that positivity is clearly an boldly echoed in the voices of our franchisees. I can tell you, I was just at one of our annual kickoff. It's unmistakable that they're pumped enthusiastic and confidence. They know they are growing. And they firmly believe there's more to be had. And our franchisee health metrics confirm all of that to be true. The quantitative trajectory delays in that data supports every bit of the positivity -- of the positive attitude. And the franchisees expressed their excitement in more formal ways. During the quarter, we were recognized by the Franchise Business Review, which surveys franchisee satisfaction. And it's the latest ranking that publication, once again, latest annual ranking -- that publication once again listed Snap-on as a top 50 franchise, marking the 16th consecutive year we received that award. And internationally, Snap-on was ranked #1, #1 in Elite Franchisees Magazine's Top U.K. Franchises for 2023, finishing not only above the U.K.-only franchise systems, but also coming in ahead of the very popular global brand -- a number of very popular global brands. Now that type of recognition reflects, I think, fundamental strength of our brand business, and it would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of innovative new products.  As part of that, Snap-on continues to lead the industry with great tool storage innovations designed to improve productivity and allow techs to personalize their workspace. We're the first to market with the LED power top, rightly lighting the greening Snap-on tools like special jewels as each store is accessed. It's quite a sight. It enables the techs to show the pride in their work. And building on that feature, in December, we started shipping the first of our new IRIS tool storage units. It's a 68-inch special edition epic roll cap, which allows the technician to adjust the draw lighting with an infinite array of color selections. It is an eye-catcher coated and great paint paired with red trim, and it also features -- besides its appearance, it also features for the first time a specially lit Snap-on logo nameplate. It's innovative, striking. And as for all epic boxes, all of them, it streams functionality. The power top and the power door provides 10 electrical outlets and 4 USB ports throughout the road that ensures that all the cordless tools, the lights, the accessories are charged and at the ready. It also features our unique speed drawer for smart customizable tool organization. It's a very popular and productive feature in the shops. Convenience, productivity and distinction, the IRIS received an overwhelming reception, helping to drive the landmark tool storage we had just in the fourth quarter -- landmark full storage quarter we had just recently. It shows that pride really is a powerful salesman. You show that every day.  Well, that's our Tools Group, booming in the U.S. progressing internationally, continuing the stream of new products, building the brand, enhancing the brand channel and moving forward with momentum.  Now for RS&I. In the fourth quarter, our RS&I Group results confirmed what we've been saying all along. Snap-on is well positioned for the ongoing rise in vehicle repair. RS&I sales in the quarter of $437.9 million increased 11.6%, including $9.5 million in unfavorable currency and a 14.3% organic gain, 14.3%, boom shakalaka. That rise was authored by -- it was a great performance, and that rise was authored by double-digit increase in OEM dealerships as manufacturers continue to release new models, invest in new equipment and implement essential tool programs. But our business in the independent garages also expanded nicely with double-digit growth in our undercar equipment and in our diagnostics and repair information products, twin pillars of strength. Shop owners need upgrades to follow the changing car park, and they now have confidence regarding their futures to act on that imperative and Snap-on is ready to help.  RS&I operating earnings for the quarter were $110.6 million, up 13.8%. And again, and the operating margin, it was 25.3%, rising 50 basis points over 2021, exhibiting our team's ability to navigate the turbulence, welding Snap-on value creation, connecting with customers, launching innovation executing RCI and doing what they're expected to do : keep raising profitability. One example is our diagnostic business, double-digit growth, led by new products. Last quarter, we mentioned the launch of our game-changing handheld diligent diagnostic unit, the . Well, it's selling at a record pace. It's in hardware and in software subscriptions. It's a great unit that again raises the bar for an advanced repair, providing technicians with a powerful health and troubleshooting and diagnostic the most complex of vehicle repairs. Zeus Plus makes those special challenges take up so much shop time appear quick and easy, and the techs are noticing. RS&I, the repair shops are confident seeing a great future, and RS&I has the products to pave their way.  Well, that's our fourth quarter. Opco organic sales rising 8%, 10 quarters of consecutive growth from pre-pandemic levels. Tools Group, demonstrating strength. Organic sales up 9.6% over last year, rising 33.2% from prepandemic levels. RS&I products to meet the needs of the vehicles of today and of tomorrow, activity up 14.3% organically, gains in both OEM dealerships and independent shops, C&I showing potential for growth despite international headwinds, strong momentum in the critical industries with much more to go. And it all drove a 21.5% operating margin for the overall enterprise, rising 50 basis points from last year and an EPS of $4.42 up over every comparison. It was another encouraging quarter.  Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.559 billion in the quarter increased 4.3% from 2021 levels, reflecting an 8% organic sales gain, partially offset by $37.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase this quarter reflects double-digit gains in the Repair Systems & Information Group, high single-digit growth in the Snap-on Tools Group and low single-digit gains in the Commercial and Industrial group.  From a geographic perspective, double-digit sales growth in both North and South America more than offset weaker demand in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 48.5% improved 40 basis points from 48.1% last year. Contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions, 40 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives more than offset higher material and other costs. Again, this quarter, we believe the corporation through pricing and RCI actions continue to navigate effectively the cost and other supply chain dynamics of the current environment.  Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27% improved 10 basis points from 27.1% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $248 million in the quarter compared to $232.2 million in 2021 as a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.5% improved 50 basis points from last year's fourth quarter. Financial services revenue of $88.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to $86.9 million last year. Operating earnings of $63.9 million decreased to $3.3 million from 2021 levels and included a return to what we believe to be a more normal level of provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings of $311.9 million in the quarter compared to $299.4 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, operating earnings margin of 25.1% was unchanged from last year.  Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22% compared to 22.3% last year. Net earnings of $238.9 million or $4.42 per diluted share increased $15.2 million or $0.32 per share from last year levels, representing a 7.8% increase in diluted earnings per share.  Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $343.2 million decreased from $358.7 million last year, reflecting a $5.7 million or 1.7% organic sales gain, which was more than offset by $21.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in the segment specialty torque business as well as a low single-digit increase in sales to customers in critical industries. These gains were partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tools business. With respect to critical industries, gains in sales to heavy-duty fleets, mining and general industry more than offset lower activity with the military.  Gross margin of 37.7% improved 120 basis points from 36.5% in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, benefits from RCI initiatives and 20 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher material and other input costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.7% in the quarter increased 120 basis points from 22.5% in 2021, mostly due to reduced sales and lower expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $47.9 million compared to $50.1 million last year. The operating margin of 14% was unchanged from last year.  Turning to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $542.7 million compared to $504.8 million a year ago, reflecting a 9.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. The quarter benefited from robust demand for our recently launched diagnostic platform as well as our tool storage product line. Gross margin of 43.2% in the quarter declined 70 basis points from 43.9% last year. The year-over-year decrease is primarily due to 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased sales of lower gross margin products and higher material and other costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits from the higher sales volume and pricing actions. As a reminder, the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products such as diagnostics, which is made by our RS&I Group. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 21.8% improved 20 basis points from 22% last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $116.1 million compared to $110.5 million last year. The operating margin of 21.4% compared to 21.9% in 2021.  Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $437.9 million increased 11.6% from $392.5 million in 2021, reflecting a 14.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $9.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment in activity with OEM dealerships and in sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers, including those diagnostic sales affected by the Snap-on Tools Group.  Gross margin of 45% declined 110 basis points from 46.1% last year, primarily due to a higher material and other input costs and increased sales in lower gross margin businesses. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from RCI initiatives as well as 80 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 19.7% improved 160 basis points from 21.3% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage, higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $110.6 million compared to $97.2 million last year. The operating margin of 25.3% improved 50 basis points from 24.8% reported a year ago.  Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from Financial Services of $88.3 million, including a $1.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation compared to $86.9 million last year. Financial Services operating earnings of $63.9 million, including $900,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $67.2 million in 2021. Financial Services expenses of $24.4 million were up $4.7 million from 2021 levels, mostly due to $4.8 million of higher provisions for credit losses. While provisions have increased versus the historically lower provision rate experienced last year, we believe that the loan portfolio trends remain stable.  For reference, provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $12.8 million as compared to $8.4 million in the fourth quarter last year, yet lower than the $14.1 million and the $16 million recorded in the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively. As a percentage of the average portfolio, Financial Services expenses were 1.1% and 0.9% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.7%. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. The blended yield for the portfolio was 15.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022, which is the same as last year.  Total loan originations of $299.7 million in the fourth quarter increased $43.4 million or 16.9% from 2021 levels, reflecting a 17% increase in originations of finance receivables, a 16.7% increase in originations of contract receivables. The increase in finance receivable originations reflects the continued strong sales of big-ticket items by our franchisees during the work.  Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our U.S. operation. The total global gross portfolio is up 3.4% year-over-year. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% for U.S. extended credit was the same as in 2021 and compared to 1.8% in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $43.8 million represented 2.4% of of outstandings at year-end. While this was up 6 basis points from a year ago, it is 47 basis points lower than year-end 2019.  Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $210.6 million in the quarter compared to $222.7 million last year. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2021 primarily reflects a 36.5% -- $36.5 million increase in working investment, partially offset by improved net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $67.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $47.3 million and capital expenditures of $22.7 million.  Net cash used by financing activities of $145.8 million included cash dividends of $86 million and the repurchase of 284,000 shares of common stock for $65.3 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $362.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations.  Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $79.4 million from 2021 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 58 days at 2021 year-end and to 67 days as of the pre-pandemic year end of 2019. Inventories increased $229.3 million from 2021 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.5 compared to 2.8 at year-end 2021 and the 2.6x as of year-end 2019. The growth in inventory primarily reflects higher demand, including inventories to support new products. Additionally, given the dynamics of the current supply chain situation, our level of safety stocks and in-transit parts, components and raw materials are up, as our year-over-year costs associated with finished goods.  Our year-end cash position of $757.2 million compared to $780 million at year-end 2021. Our net debt to capital ratio of 9% compared to 9.1% at year-end 2021. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate, absent any changes to the U.S. tax legislation, that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter and our year. I would say we can characterize particularly the fourth quarter as a period where the hits just kept on coming : sporadic supply shortages, war, Brexit, lockdowns, virus explosion and a constant drumbeat of recession warnings that served up bad news for breakfast every day. You can also describe the recent path of the time when Snap-on clearly demonstrated the resilience of its markets and the power of its businesses. C&I. engaging the full range of challenges across sectors and geographies but overcoming, growing 1.7% organically, registering an OI margin of 14%, flat to last year, reflecting the turbulence of the moment but up 120 basis points from pre-pandemic levels. The Tools Group, big ticket items surging, organic sales growing 9.6% overall, OI margin at 21.4%, up big from pre-pandemic levels, down from last year but primarily due to 40 points of negative currency and a similar impact from less favorable product mix. Still strong. RS&I, success in both OEM dealerships and independent shops, sales of 14.3% organically and an OI margin of 25.3%, up 50 basis points from last year. We said we're well positioned for the comeback and repair shops, and RS&I is showing just that.  And the credit company, OI down, but finance originations growing a strong 17%, and all of it authored strong numbers for the corporation. Organic sales up 8% versus last year, 22.7% versus pre-pandemic levels. OI margin of 21.5%, 21.5%, up 50 basis points compared with 2021 and 360 basis points over 2019. Full year organic sales were up the OI margin for the year was 20.9%, a rise of 90 basis points. And finally, EPS for the quarter of $4.42, up 7.8% versus last year and 43.5% versus prepandemic levels.  The hits did just keep coming, but Snap-on overcame. We exited the year stronger than when we entered, and we left the quarter in December with greater position and strength than we had in early October. We do have momentum, and you can see it in the numbers. We believe our markets will remain resilient, offer ongoing and abundant opportunities, and with our inherent advantages, the breadth and quality of our products. the unique and aspirational nature of our brands and the considerable capabilities of our experienced team, we believe we will maintain the momentum and extend our ongoing positive trajectory throughout 2023 and well beyond.  Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know that many of you are listening. You are the people of work, the individuals whose contributions collectively fostered these results. As I look back over the quarter, over 2022 and, in fact, over the past 3 years, it's clear your efforts, as you met the justifiable fear with extraordinary vigilance, helped keep our society and our company from disintegrating while we engaged and prevailed against the COVID. We often say that Snap-on people are unique, special and consistently make a difference. The past 3 years have clearly proved its so. For your ongoing achievement in the past quarter and many others, you have my congratulations. For your continued dedication in enabling the work of our society, you have my admiration. And for your confident commitment to Snap-on and its future, you have my thanks. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today will come from Luke Junk with Baird. . Luke Junk : I apologize if any of this has been covered in the prepared remarks, joining the call a little bit late this morning. First question... Nicholas Pinchuk : It was good. Luke Junk : That's helpful summary. I'll dive margin-related question to start with. And what I'm wondering is, now we've got several commodities, including steel that are off of their highs that we saw in 2022, and can you just help us understand how that might start to flow into your P&L this year, especially in the Tools Group? I know that typically, there's at least a couple quarter time lag that's associated with that? Is that still a good way to think about it? And at the same time, still broader inflationary pressures out there. If you could also comment on your approach to pricing as we begin 2023. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, I think -- I'll answer the last question first. I think our approach to pricing as we see the situation when we meet the individual timing, like the individual quarters, I think you're going to see a mixed result. You said it correctly that things work its way and some kind of lag into your P&L as you go forward in terms of the pricing. If you look back, you do see a mixed review and, say, steel, for example. Hand tool steel is down some, it's not down to pre-pandemic levels, but tool storage steel is down closer to pre-pandemic levels. So you see some variation in that. And it doesn't look like they're going to go back up. It looks like you're going to -- I would expect to see them -- if they go to prepandemic levels, maybe that's equilibrium. But if you're above that, we kind of expect it to kind of go downwards. The thing that -- and you'll see that work its way through and give us some relief going forward. But the timing of that is a little uncertain based on what you said, associated with the lag. The big impact from the supply chain for us has been the availability of certain items. And so sometimes, even today, even as the supply chain is regularized, you can't find certain things, and you have to go out and spot market and get it. This particularly bedevils C&I., Tools Group less so, but it's impacted some of the RS&I things from time to time. So supply chain, I would say, in terms of a negative factor is abating but not disappearing as we go forward. That's what I see. So it's taken some pressure off. It's hard for me to predict, though, about certain supplies that could come up at any time. So you see that kind of situation. Luke Junk : My follow-up question is around credit. So if you look at credit performance, I mean, it's been very good if we look at delinquency rates in the back half of the year versus normal seasonality that's in the context of what's becoming clearly more -- just more macro risk, generally speaking, originations trending higher. How do you balance credit in 2023 between managing the risk side and pushing on what does seem like it could still be an incremental growth driver for the Tools Group given where we're coming from? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, look, I think this -- we don't change our policies in terms of risk based on the externals so much. We don't raise or drop our -- the credit standards associated with do we need sales or not. We pretty much focus on the same customer and look at it in the same way going forward. I think what you're seeing in rise of originations, it has nothing to do with the credit -- necessarily the credits to the customers. I think everybody says that professional technicians have a pretty -- had a pretty strong balance sheet for some time. I think what you've seen is a combination of compelling product and our technicians seeing the great opportunities they have, numbers of -- demand for technicians up, wages up and the repair systems up. You can see it in the macro sort of getting more confident to invest in big ticket items. I think to the extent you see originations, that's not driven by any credit policy, that's driven by the big ticket items. And whether we use credit or not will be dependent on how well the products are selling in the marketplace. Now right now, the thing about it is, is that if you have big ticket items leading the way in a robust quarter, and they were up double digits, , I think, baffle was the word I said. I think that says a lot for confidence because what my experience is, and I've been here a while, my experience is that when people -- when things start to look gloomy a little bit in professional technicians, the need doesn't go away but they tend to shift more to shorter payback items, not big ticket items. That's what happened in the great financial recession. So the fact that we had a big ticket boom, I think, gives me a lot of great confidence in our future. Operator : And our next question will come from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki : So the -- I mean, the automotive repair industry has arguably had some benefit from the surge in used vehicle values that caused some older vehicles to stay on the road for longer and vehicle owners to invest in maintenance. So I guess as used vehicle values are falling and potentially some more new vehicles start to get on the road and get into dealerships, I mean is Snap-on agnostic to that shift in vehicle aging? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, really I mean, I think as we serve the dealerships just as well. I mean, you could argue that older cars have more repairs and maybe be entitled to that. But in reality, it's a long wave of event, Liz. The fact that new cars are becoming -- the fact that used cars were being held longer, we don't really think that makes that much a difference. We followed it for years. And when you look at a year or a quarter when, let's say, scrappage is up or scrappage is down, it doesn't seem to affect the numbers at all. So for us, I think if you said, okay, the car park is going to get younger over time, then that would be some pressure on repair. But the car park has gotten older every year since 1980. So I don't think that's going to change very much. And we -- I would not put the shift to used cars as much of a factor in the strength of the automotive repair market from our perspective. So I think any change from that is not going to make a difference, really. And we do serve the dealers. We actually get -- our revenues in the Tools Group is about the dealership -- revenue from the dealerships in the Tools Group actually almost dead on reflects the amount of repair that they have as a percentage of the total repair done in the country. So we're kind of agnostic between dealerships and independent repair shops. Elizabeth Suzuki : Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then just a question on capital allocation. And I'm curious to get your thoughts on the company's current appetite for M&A and which segments you feel are potentially more fragmented and where Snap-on could continue to roll up smaller businesses and what the pipeline might look like currently. Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, look, I think we have a pipeline. We have a number of prospects we always look at, but we have -- what we do is we look to say we have runways for growth, enhance the van channel, expand with repair shop owners and managers, extend the critical industries and build in emerging markets. And we're always looking for something that's operating in the critical task space, where the penalties for failure are high, in other words, not DIY, but professional space. That can advance our position along one of those runways. There isn't much in the Tools Group because the Tools Group is already in a strong position there and it doesn't need too much. But if you look at -- and in emerging markets -- maybe in emerging markets now that's going to start opening up with all the turbulence that's been floating around there. But our 2 sweet spots in this have been in expand repair shop owners and managers, that's a junk RS&I or extend the critical industry.  And when we look there is give us a product that gives us more to sell to those customers or a new technology that's important to the customers or gives us a presence with customers. So for example, I mentioned Norbar. Norbar is an acquisition, which got us bigger in torque. It's critical. It's a technology we could use some help in at the top end. So we acquired it and it was a great success story. You can see the same kind of thing in RS&I with the acquisitions of Dealer-FX, where we wanted to beef up our software position in dealerships, one, because it's a profitable situation; but two, because it gives you a strategic advantage in terms of the visibility of new products that are going to enter the market just as you talked about, the new products, you get a better view of it. So that's the kind of thing.  So things that will advance us down those runways for growth are things we have money for, and we have no shyness about acquiring things. big or small. But we're careful. We take care of our money. So we don't transform the company. We're looking for coherent acquisitions. And there are a bunch of those. But sometimes when we look at something that isn't -- it's only 30% what we do or sometimes it isn't what we thought -- where we thought it was and we decided we don't want to have it, other times we do. In case of Norbar, Dealer-FX, we thought positively. Operator : And our next question will come from Scott Stember with MKM Partners. . Unidentified Analyst : And Nick, you talked about the big ticket items really driving the show for the Tools Group, but how did the hand tools perform in the quarter? Nicholas Pinchuk : Hand tools were flat. So hands tools have been booming. They were like going wild in the last year and the first part of this year, and they are the high -- actually, believe it or not, they're the highest margin business in the hand tools. And so they're great. But when they back down a little bit, that puts a little margin pressure on them in the Tools Group. Flat is okay, though because they're really still strong. But tool storage is a great margin business, and that was up strong double-digit, fact, best tool storage ever. In fact, I had a guy telling me, I was out talking to the sales guy, he told me he could sell every tool storage unit I could build for him. Our backlog is exploding in tool storage. So we can sell a lot of them. And then -- so -- and that doesn't have much effect on margin. The real margin -- the source of the margin comment here was diagnostics. Diagnostics makes a lot of money for the corporation, but the Tools Group shares the margin with RS&I. Remember, RS&I makes it and sells it to the Tools Group. So from a pure Tools Group or when you're looking at diagnostics, that margin is a lower one for them. And so the flatness of hand tools and the rise in diagnostics created that margin pressure that moved it down somewhat in this period. But we thought this is great. It's one of the reasons why we have 21.5%, one of the reasons why RS&I was up 50 basis points, you see, because of diagnostics sells well for them. So that's sort of the way.  The other thing, as I said before, I want to emphasize, boy, I think it's a good sign for the future that big ticket is strong. Now you might argue, okay, diagnostics had a special case because we launched the Zeus, and it's the best thing since [indiscernible] and everybody loves it. But the fact that tool storage is selling well really indicates an underlying confidence in the customer base, which speaks well for our situation. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then just last question. What's the relationship of sell-in versus sell-through of the event? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Look, we look at these things. They're about in the range where we like to see it, about sort of equal. So when you look back from sell-in to sell-out, we see that being about balance. Now it always goes up and down a little bit every quarter, but this is kind of in the range. I think this quarter, it's about equal. . Operator : And our next question will come from David McGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Nick, you're continuing to expand the lexicon of the contemporary CEO. Boom shakalaka, that's... . Nicholas Pinchuk : Gee, [indiscernible] special. David MacGregor : Listen, let me ask you about your balance sheet. Your working capital investment continues to grow. I can appreciate you've got more inventory in transit and safety stock. But can you talk about your plans to harvest that cash? And is the inventory accumulation concentrated within specific lines of business or specific products? And how much of that's tool segment versus the other 2 segments? Nicholas Pinchuk : I'm -- I like our inventory because we have a lot of faith in the future, but I'll let -- Aldo has got to answer a question. I'll let him say something here. Aldo, why don't you say something? Aldo Pagliari : Well, David, if you're looking year-over-year, yes, the Tools Group makes a major portion of it, but it's not all of it. But actually, the Tools Group has their inventories kind of reflective of the fact that they've had very consistent organic growth. And therefore, I think it's suitable. If you look at some of the other areas where we're investing, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's not insignificant the amount of money that's tied up in in-transit inventory and safety stocks. Again, Snap-on has made a strategic decision to err on the side of availability. So that is priority #1. So a long answer to your question, we think the inventory is appropriate given the opportunities we see in front of us and the fact that we don't want to miss on the opportunities that present themselves as we go forward and not have disruption from the supply chain. Now again, Snap-on is blessed, for lack of a better word, with we're not a typical consumer retail-oriented company, and therefore, we're not subject to the fashion sense, I like to say, many other companies have to be concerned about. So our product doesn't really obsolesce on the shelf, so to speak. I mean, yes, you have to update the algorithms in a diagnostic unit or an alignment machine, but pretty much we feel pretty confident that making an investment in inventory is going to pay off and being able to capture sales in projects or programs that manifest themselves as we go forward. David MacGregor : I can appreciate that you need that inventory to support the sales activity, but it continues to grow. And I guess the question is, at some point, do you have enough? And at what point if any, is there an opportunity to harvest that cash? Or is this kind of a structural step-up? Aldo Pagliari : There's probably opportunities to harvest that, David, you're absolutely right, but I wouldn't model it that way. In other words, I just told you what our strategic decision is. And trust me, you have even more inventory. You will never have exactly the right thing at the right time. So you have to be prepared to have a flexible factory and a flexible distribution center because of 80,000 different SKUs, impossible to forecast what the accuracy you would like. And then you multiply the statistical probability of having them when you have to put arrays of SKUs that could have 100 to 200 pieces together, and you can see what drives the need for a lot of products. And then on top of it, you have spare part requirements sometimes imposed by regulations. So if you're going to sell machines that have a life of 10-plus years such as lifts and linear machines, tire changes, wheel balances, there's obligations behind the scenes to keep ample supplies of spare parts on hand. So you put that all together, and again, we will err in favor of availability. There could be opportunities to harvest. In just saying that we don't model ourselves cash flow growth from reduction in inventories, even though that certainly is theoretically possible. David MacGregor : Good. Let me ask you about growth, and you mentioned the improving supply channels. How much of the growth in each segment would you estimate is driven by shipping from backlog orders rather than new orders? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, look, certainly isn't much say in the critical industries. So our backlog just keeps growing there. That's because they keep being bedeviled by the supply chain disruption. That's sort of the thing I was saying. Our backlog is really strong there. And I don't think much is in the Tools Group. Our backlog in tool storage at all-time high, and we're actually expanding 2 of the plants in the Tools Group this year to try to keep up with this whole situation. You can look at different places like you'd be entitled to the idea that, geez, I think Europe is a little bit under the weather. So you see that kind of thing there, but the U.S. seems to be booming to me. So I don't know. You can -- it seems to me as though I think you can look at it that way. U.S. is pretty strong. And we're trying to -- look, we have real confidence in the future. That's why we're expanding our capabilities here. If I could expand the more tool storage, I would tomorrow. I told you -- I think I said before, the guy said he could -- one of the guys -- one of the top sales guys said he could sell everything I could give him. So I think we're sitting on some pretty good strength in that situation. So I think you called it book-to-bill last time. I think that's pretty healthy in the U.S., a little more turbulence in Europe. David MacGregor : Last question. Okay. Yes. Nick, last question for me. Just the 10-Q is not out yet, so, Aldo, maybe if you could just give us the finance receivable charge-offs. And then just how were overwrites this quarter? Aldo Pagliari : Overrides are not as dynamic as what they've been in the past. Again, that decision is made with the franchisee. They've been a little bit more conservative compared to the 2016 to 2019 window. We still think personally that it's a good bet because we have a lot of metrics behind in process that kind of gives a higher sense of collectibility on things like that as compared to other companies that might be more upstart, so to speak, when it comes to lending to the credit profile of mechanics. But to directly answer your question, our returns are not as high as what they've been in the pre-pandemic world. And the charge-offs, I think I made a remark in my prepared remarks. The charge-offs, if you look at the provisions, they're actually narrower. I think we're about 4-point, what was it, $4.4 million difference in the rate of provision. The differential between charge-offs is actually less than that. What drove the provision up a little higher is actually with the significant increase in originations. We, from experience, have to book extra reserve provisions because of that because while everything starts out well, you know there's going to be a need for some reserves. So the fact that you high originations in the quarter actually drives a higher provision as well. So probably the increase year-over-year is about $1.1 million or so of higher provisions just associated with higher originations. . David MacGregor : Right. You provisioned pretty aggressively back in 2020, which was to your credit, but you've been working that down with charge-offs exceeding provisions for 8 of the 9 last quarters. So kind of getting back now to prepandemic level. Aldo Pagliari : No, no, that's what makes the comparison tougher now, David. Exactly right. Probably by the end of Q1 of 2022, the reserve was probably reduced because of the -- we finally realized we didn't need as much as what we had provided for in 2020, 2021. And that's why I like to use the expression, we're returning to a more normalized rate of provision, and that's what you kind of see now. Operator : Our next question will come from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. . Unidentified Analyst : This is Patrick Buckley on for Bret Jordan. In the C&I business, are there any other areas internationally to highlight? You've spoken about a bit here with the European hand tools. But is the weaker economic environment, the main drag there? Or is something else driving that? Nicholas Pinchuk : It's the weaker economics. The U.K. has got a whole bunch of problems, the revolving door prime ministers and so on and that kind of thing. And it tends to be more organized around the Northern parts of that business. I think driven in the fourth quarter pretty much by a lot of banks that was in Europe in the fourth quarter over the fuel situation, and that weighed heavily on the people. And I think the whole idea that the recession is coming, the recession is coming there has kind of hit them. You got China who is like -- it's chaos in China. I mean, those guys went from being 6 weeks in their apartments to all of a sudden, let everything go, come to work with COVID. And 3/4 Quite population, some people say, got COVID. So I think things kind of went stand still because of the lockdowns in various cities and standstill because everybody is getting it. So that thing has been afflicted. So I'm not sure how quickly it comes back. So you have that. The other international markets like other parts of Asia, like Southeast Asia seen pretty good in that situation. So I think it's just COVID in Asia, particularly China, and the general sort of combination of recession is coming, fuel angst in England, reemergence of now we're out of COVID, the Brexit problems reemerge and the whole idea of the war is there kind of cast a pall over Europe. Although lately, I just heard some data that said that GDP is going to grow in Europe higher than other places, I don't know. I'm from Missouri on that one. I think Europe is a little weaker than maybe has been reflected in that. . That's what -- and then one other thing you do see is that we have -- I think I said this before, we have a strong demand in the critical industries. If we could source a little better, if we didn't have the varying disruptions of what's in supply, we could -- we would have been much stronger in this quarter and in past quarters. So one of the things that drives both the maybe some of the -- cast an overhang on the sales and put some -- hang on the margins because of you have to pay for the spot buys and it will always come in. And that's really in the critical industries where if you don't realize, there is our custom kits with maybe 200 or 300 items in them, and they must be shipped complete. So if you don't have 1 or 2 of them, we can't ship. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe could you talk a bit more on the subscription side of the RSI business? How sizable is that today? And how does the growth outlook there compared to [indiscernible]? Nicholas Pinchuk : The growth outlook is pretty good. the subscriptions are going up. I mean, they're going up through the roof. But the thing is, remember that you probably -- you may or may not realize this, but that the other -- the former version, and still we do some of this is, we would sell what we call not subscriptions, but titles. So every 6 months, we come out with a new software addition, and technicians could buy it for their diagnostic unit or not. And we're transitioning from that sort of every 6 months or every year pop to, okay, pay me every month. And so there's some balance in that. But software is growing in the situation, and we can see we can see some positivity in that regard. And so that's one of the things that is starting to help out software in the -- help out the RS&I margins. In fact, I think we want to make sure we focus more on that going forward. So I think that's one of our great opportunities. We see a lot of opportunity in things like dealership software and independent repair shop software. And the Mitchell 1 business, which we didn't mention in this, is still growing like clockwork. It's growing nicely and its profitability is strong. It's just not up in the double-digit range, but the subscription business is growing nicely. Operator : And our next question will come from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial Partners. Ivan Feinseth : Congratulations again on another great year and a great quarter. Nicholas Pinchuk : Thank you. Ivan Feinseth : So just 2 questions. One, as far as new product development, where do you see going with -- as car onboard ADAS systems continue to grow of increasing diagnostic and calibration capabilities inside, let's say, Apollo and Zeus. And then also the CEO of General Motors has said many times she envisions $50 billion in revenue coming from software and subscriptions, especially as cars become increasingly -- have increasing software-defined functionality. And though the dealerships will have to kind of become an increasing part of that equation. So how do you see that benefiting dealer... Nicholas Pinchuk : No, that's going to -- well, I think it benefits us greatly because look, if you want to -- sort of like it isn't a $50 billion example, but we do have examples associated with just what you said, ADAS, the advanced driver assistance systems, and the calibrations associated with that. That's behind -- that's sold enabled both through our diagnostics, like you said, like Zeus and Apollo in those, and it's enabled through our undercar equipment business. And those are the 2 businesses that taste the RS&I group, they were both up nice double digits. And really the software and the physicals associated with calibration have been helping drive the situation in undercar equipment and the input around ADAS systems in Mitchell 1 and in the diagnostic systems has helped drive their attractiveness.  And as more of that goes in, those products are going to get more and more essential to the technician. You see, what you're saying, I think another way to talk about this, Ivan, is this, is that right now, let's say, if you look at the total car park, like maybe 45% of the repairs require a diagnostic unit. But if you look at new units, it's like 80%. And as software starts to rise, more and more of the places where we have leadership in terms of repair information and in the software that's going to wheel that information and the calibration will be important for us. And that's all making money for us now. And the wider it gets, the more we're going to have in that situation.  So we're developing products along that line. One of the things that you don't even think about is in collision. I think you know this very well. But the thing is right now, new cars are like a neural network of sensors. And if they get dinged, you get your bumper dinged. It's a major operation to recalibrate it and reset the sensors and so on. And that's making -- that's driving a lot of the underneath car -- the undercar activity in RS&I. So we're already seeing that. And so we're focusing on that stuff as well. A big portion of our business now -- or development now is associated with software. And you're going to see that we're going to focus on it more and more as we go forward. . Ivan Feinseth : I believe software sales is going to be an increasing opportunity for you, so I'm excited for it. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. We're going to make sure we get big focus on it. But I think we already have a pretty good position in it. We just see as it develops, these are going to create opportunities that are going to lay out there in front of you. . Ivan Feinseth : Congratulations again. Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks a lot. Take care. . Operator : And this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks. . Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

As usual, I\u2019ll start the call by covering the highlights of the first quarter, and I\u2019ll give you my perspective on what it all means. And then Aldo will provide a detailed review of the financials. Along the way, we\u2019ll cover the markets, the robust gangbusters. We\u2019ll also give you a view of our momentum. It\u2019s been unbroken and vibrant. Once again, the story of our quarter is continued resilience. Our ability to navigate the complex while knowing that with the flip of a calendar -- the flip of a calendar will bring new challenges. You could pick up any significant publication or listen or watch any business show and you will encounter a barrage of concerns, the measures of adversity and contraction. But we know, we can resist the difficulties, and so we have for the past three months and for quarter after quarter. You see, we\u2019re armed with significant advantages. Our market\u2019s displaying resilience; born out of criticality, our brand standing above delivering quality and reinforcing personal pride; our products. They clearly move the world forward by making the critical easier; and finally, our people, our team, experienced, capable and confident. We are encouraged by this quarter, and I\u2019ll tell you why. Our reported sales in the period were $1,183 million, up versus last year by $85.2 million or 7.8%, including $24 million or 240 basis points of unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales, they were up 10.2%, increases in every group, our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating expansion. Our OpCo operating income for the quarter was $259.8 million, including $7.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency, increasing by 16.5%. And the operating margin -- the operating margin, it was 22%, rising 170 basis points over last year. For financial services, operating income of $66.3 million compared to last year\u2019s $70.4 million. And that combined with OpCo -- and that combined with OpCo resulted in a consolidated operating margin of 25.6%, an 80 basis-point improvement. And the first quarter\u2019s EPS, $4.60, up $0.60 or 15% from last year\u2019s $4. So we believe our confidence and our ongoing optimism is clearly justified by the numbers. Now, let\u2019s look closer at our markets. The automotive repair environment remains hot, demand across all disciplines. We continue investing in new products and accommodating the repair challenges of newer models, matching the increased complexity. As platforms change, the modification requires new tools to accomplish the task and we\u2019re keeping pace. Whether it\u2019s an internal combustion engine or an electric vehicle, the techs need an assist, and we\u2019re ready to bring it. The updates create a range of challenges, new challenges, from accessibility issues associated with confined spaces requiring new designs of varying geometries, to tighter engineering challenges fueling the need for precision torque instrument to the increasing number of fasteners and listing our power tools to remove and install parts efficiently to the rise of drive by wire. More electronics -- the more the electronics, the greater the need for handheld diagnostics and special software that can communicate with and manage the neural network of computers and sensors. We\u2019re seeing strength in OEM dealerships. As new models break on to the market, new arrays of essential tools, equipment and diagnostics are needed to service the different and unique characteristics of each vehicle. For independent repair shops, business is booming. If you\u2019re taking your vehicle in for service, recently, you\u2019ve witnessed this first hand, the pays are full and the parking lots are chockablock. And when I speak with our franchisees, they are enthusiastic, saying demand is robust. It\u2019s written all over the numbers. Garages are scheduled further out for shops of all types. Owners see the growth. They know they need technicians. And as you might expect, the rise in the tech count is substantial and the wages are moving up. And then, of course, this is all music to our ears. We believe that with the new vehicle models, the rise of automation, the growing need for precision and the increasing vehicle complexity, we may be entering the golden age of vehicle repair and our numbers say it may be so. So people repair. It\u2019s a great place to operate for our Tools Group and for our Repair Systems & Information Group, RS&I. And we believe it\u2019s only getting better. Now, let\u2019s talk about the critical industries where commercial and industrial or C&I, take Snap-on out of the garage, solving tasks of consequences, representing our most significant international presence. It\u2019s an area where we\u2019re -- I suppose, most subject to global headwinds, but the news is still reasonably encouraging. The critical industries kept rising across sectors, aviation, education, heavy-duty fleets, general industry and natural resources, all up. And the military, once down, is now rebounding with high demand. And for geographies, North America was strong. Europe was improved even in the face of ongoing -- of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the revenue disruption of the Brexit, and Asia Pacific remained mixed, variation across the landscape. But overall, the critical industry markets of C&I showed significant and broad positives, every sector. The first quarter is marked by substantial strides in that arena, and we see more opportunity on the horizon. We believe there\u2019s abundant and ongoing potential all along our runways for growth, enhancing the van network, expanding with repair shop owners and managers, extending the critical industry and building in emerging markets, leveraging our expansive product line, wielding our strengthening brand and deploying the increasing understanding of the task, connecting to the customer, standing face-to-face in the workplace where the tasks are performed, observing the work, turning that insight into innovative new products and some in the future for professionals. And we amplify that endeavor by applying a generous helping of rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, as we call it, driving our productivity and our margin upwards. So, that\u2019s our view of the market. Now, let\u2019s turn to the groups. In the C&I Group, sales of $363.8 million, including $12.5 million unfavorable foreign currency, increased 7% to last year. Organic sales were up 11.1% with double-digit gains in critical industries and specialty torque that precision leading the way. C&I\u2019s operating income of $55.8 million, including $2 million of unfavorable foreign currency, represents an increase of 22.1% over last year, and the operating margin was 15.3%, up 190 basis points from the 2022 level, promising numbers. C&I demonstrated considerable growth, despite the ongoing uncertainty across geographies. One of the factors that\u2019s been attenuating C&I in the recent past was the impact of supply turbulence. The customized -- you heard me say it on the calls, the customized kits with many different products are vulnerable to availability disruption. And one of the drivers behind the C&I rise were the improvements along the supply chain. During the period, we started to clean the logjams and reduced the impacts. The first quarter is evidence of that progress. For some time, we\u2019ve said that the demand in critical initiatives have been strong. It continued in the first quarter. And that positive is rooted in innovative products designed specifically for making a difference in critical paths. One example is our new ATECH 1/4 inch drive flex-head TechAngle micro torque wrench, sure a mouthful, but it\u2019s a great product. It\u2019s aimed directly at the aircraft repair -- where at aircraft repair with a necessity for torque precision is rising. The need for power is increasing and repair and tight spaces is becoming more common. Our new unit works on all three fronts. The new wrench is almost 1 foot long, but less than an inch in diameter configured to facilitate access deep inside engine compartments. It\u2019s also equipped with a 15-degree flex-head design, allowing it to avoid obstacles. And it uses our durable 72-inch -- 72 tooth gear mechanism, enabling the tool to operate with small rotations when the barriers restrict motion, making it tough to wrench. The new ATECH has power, significant power, reaching 300-inch and it\u2019s expanding the range by 20% and increasing the number of applications that tool can cover, consolidating tests from multiple devices into one convenient unit and eliminating change over time, providing -- that\u2019s providing a nice productivity gain. The unit has 4 alert modes, LCD, LED, vibratory and audible. Those four prevent over torquing, even when the visibility is low and the space is constrained. And when combined with the unit\u2019s accuracy of plus or minus 2%, the feature served to keep the fastening right on spec. The ATECH accessibility, power and accuracy protects throughout the aviation sector. It\u2019s another hit product that helped drive C&I upward in this quarter. Well, that\u2019s C&I, on the rise, higher sales, stronger profits, powerful products and more to come. Now on to the Tools Group. Sales of $537.0 million, up $24.9 million, including $7.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency, registering a 6.3% organic gain with high single-digit increases in the U.S. and a low single-digit rise in the international network, and the operating margin -- the operating margin was 24.5%, up 180 basis points against 80 basis points of unfavorable currency, boomshakalaka!. This was a great number for us. We\u2019re really optimistic and encouraged by this. The vehicle repair markets are strong and resilient and they trace an ongoing path of abundant opportunity. And once again, the tools numbers back it up. But beyond the quantitative evidence, I was just with some of our -- our van drivers last week. And their view was incandescently positive. That\u2019s the only word I can use, without equivocation or without question. They say shops are busy. All the product -- all our product lines are in high demand and their technician customers are brimming with confidence. It seems like the people of vehicle repair from top to bottom have great expectations for the way forward. And that positivity is evident in the continuing enthusiasm for big tickets, longer payback items, diagnostics and tool storage boxes. They continue to be major contributors to our results. You can see it in the success of the top of the line ZEUS+ handheld diagnostics units. You can find it in the reception of our latest addition to the EPIQ tool storage lineup. The 68-inch EPIQ limited edition box, toolbox, we call it the Neon Stinger. It\u2019s generated considerable excitement with its eye-catching look, a gloss black body with the newest color in tool storage trim, [indiscernible]. I mean this baby pops. Even at a less than bright light in say, the corner of a shop of a tool storage -- a repair shop, it stands out to any place, giving the techs a chance to make a statement. And it\u2019s not just the glow. It also offers a range of powerful functionality. The speed drawer providing customizable organizations, a power drawer with securable charging space, and LED power top spanning the entire length of the box, fully illuminating the drawers and the tools making them shine like the jewels they are. The Stinger, it also offers a 15 power outlets and 6 USB ports, all to ensure the tech -- cordless tools, lights and accessories are always charged and ready to go. I\u2019ll tell you, demand was strong and the Stinger was a Snap-on million-dollar hit product in a blink of an eye. So the Tools Group, robust demand in all product segments and the momentum train just kept running throughout the quarter. Now let\u2019s speak of RS&I. Sales reached $446.6 million, up $48.4 million or 12.2%, including $6 million in unfavorable foreign currency. Organic activity advanced 13.9% with double-digit increases in undercar equipment and OEM business is driving the game, two big contributors. RS&I operating earnings were $104.6 million, rising 14.2% over last year, and the operating margin was 23.4%, up 40 basis points. Again -- once again, this quarter, software products and subscriptions were a significant plus. Along those lines, our Mitchell 1 division responsible for providing repair information software to independent shops, continue to succeed, pursuing customer connection and innovation by bringing great new improvements to shop efficiency. And this year -- an example is at this year\u2019s meeting of the heavy-duty technology and maintenance council in Orlando, Mitchell 1 introduced our powerful wiring navigation features specifically for trucks. It was immediately clear to large truck professionals that our new software would make it much easier and quicker for technicians to navigate the challenges of electrical issues on today\u2019s ever more complex vehicles, whether powered by internal combustion or battery cells. The feature makes a real difference. It\u2019s a significant aid to truck repair -- to the truck repair world, enabling quick transition from one wiring diagram to another, following the wire without interruption between views. This is a significant time saver for the techs across the industry and the shops are noticing. Mitchell 1 just released another great product. It\u2019s automated work package function for its collision repair software. The new system gathers into one screen all the relevant information needed for collision jobs, overhaul procedures, illustrations and diagrams, all retrieved with the click of a button with one click of the button. One of the difficulties in collision repair is that the multifaceted nature of the task. You need part details, repair procedures, system diagrams, but that information is usually found in separate places in varying categories within the vehicle\u2019s documentation. Our new system combines the data into a single work package that guides the technician progressively through the effective repair. It sounds really simple. But in fact, the consolidated comprehensive information eliminates the 20 to 90 minutes that\u2019s ordinarily needed to prepare an effective guide for collision repair test. We believe that the software will be a big contributor to Mitchell 1\u2019s growth. It\u2019s a clear savings in an area that\u2019s rising in modern vehicle repair. With the increase of vehicle automation and the associated growth in sensor networks, collision repair is increasingly more important, and our new feature is right on target to ease of the way. We keep expanding in RS&I. We keep expanding RS&I\u2019s position with repair shop owners and managers, offering more and more solutions for the day-to-day challenges, wielding customer connection and innovation to essential components of Snap-on value creation, processes to drive winning new software and hardware. We\u2019re confident. It\u2019s a successful formula and RS&I results reinforce that view. So, those are the highlights of our quarter. Continued momentum. Our 11th straight period of year-over-year operating growth. C&I is showing strength, gaining against the supply turbulence of the day, RS&I remaining robust, rising with software and hardware. The Tools Group, a healthy and enhanced van network, aiming for more, organic sales in the quarter, up 10.2%; OpCo operating margin 22% and EPS $4.60, up 15% over last year, a significant increase. It all adds up. It all serves to provide clear evidence and powerful testimony that Snap-on has emerged from the great withering in the COVID, stronger than when it entered and the enterprise is continuing that upward trend with capability and conviction. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on slide 6. Net sales of $1.183 million in the quarter increased 7.8% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 10.2% organic sales gain, partially offset by $24 million or 240 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase this quarter includes broad-based gains across all of the segments. From a geographic perspective, we experienced double-digit year-over-year organic sales growth in North America and low single-digit organic gains in Europe. Consolidated gross margin of 49.8% improved 110 basis points from 48.7% last year. Contributions from the increased sales volumes and pricing actions and benefits from the Company\u2019s RCI initiatives more than offset the effects of higher material and other costs as well as 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. While the supply chain environment has somewhat improved, we believe the corporation continued to navigate effectively costs and other challenges associated with the ongoing conditions. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.8%, improved 60 basis points from 28.4% last year. Operating earnings before financial services of $259.8 million in the quarter compared to $223.1 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22% improved 170 basis points from last year\u2019s first quarter. Financial Services revenue of $92.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased 5.6% compared to $87.7 million last year. Operating earnings of $66.3 million decreased $4.1 million from 2022 levels and included a return to what we believe to be a more normal level of provisions for credit losses than those recorded last year. Consolidated operating earnings $326.1 million in the quarter compared to $293.5 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.6% improved 80 basis points from last year. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 23.1% compared to 23.7% last year. Net earnings of $248.7 million or $4.60 per diluted share including $0.12 of unfavorable impact associated with foreign currency, increased $31.3 million or $0.60 per share from 2022 levels, representing a 15% increase in diluted earnings per share. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I on slide 7. Sales of $363.8 million increased from $340.1 million last year, reflecting a $36.2 million or 11.1% organic sales gain, which was partially offset by $12.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects double-digit gains in sales to customers in critical industries and in the segment specialty torque business as well as low single-digit increase in the segment\u2019s European-based hand tools business. With respect to critical industries, the sales gains were wide ranging in the quarter. In addition to higher activity across general industry, sales of the military were robust as were sales to technical education, aviation and natural resources. Gross margin of 38.8% improved 240 basis points from 36.4% in the first quarter of 2022. This was primarily due to higher sales volumes including increased activity and the higher gross margin critical industries, pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by the effects of higher material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 23.5% in the quarter increased 50 basis points from 23% in 2022, mostly due to increased sales and higher expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.8 million increased 22.1%, $45.7 million last year. The operating margin of 15.3% improved 190 basis points from 13.4% last year. Turning now to slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $537 million compared to $512.1 million a year ago, reflecting a 6.3% organic sales gain, partially offset by $7.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a high single-digit gain in our U.S. business and a low single-digit increase in our international operations. Sales in the quarter were up year-over-year in all product lines. Gross margin of 47.3% in the quarter improved 180 basis points from 45.5% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 22.8% were unchanged from last year. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $131.7 million, including $6.1 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, increased $15.7 million from last year, while the operating margin of 24.5%, including 80 basis points of unfavorable currency effects, improved 180 basis points from 22.7% in 2022. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on slide 9. Sales of $446.6 million increased 12.2% from $398.2 million in 2022, reflecting a 13.9% organic sales gain, partially offset by $6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain is comprised of double-digit increases in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment and in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in the sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin of 43.5% declined 110 basis points from 44.6% last year, primarily due to increased sales in lower gross margin businesses and the effects of higher material and other costs. These declines were partially offset by benefits from pricing actions and savings from our RCI initiatives as well as 30 basis points of favorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.1% improved 150 basis points from 21.6% last year, primarily due to benefits from sales volume leverage and higher activity and lower expense businesses and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $104.6 million compared to $91.6 million last year. The operating margin of 23.4% compared to 23% reported a year ago. Now turning to slide 10. Revenue from financial services of $92.6 million increased from $87.7 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $66.3 million, including $700,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $70.4 million in 2022. Financial services expenses of $26.3 million were up $9 million from 2022 levels, including $8.1 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. For reference, provisions for finance receivable losses in the quarter were $14.2 million, as compared to $6.3 million in the first quarter last year. In the first quarters of 2019 and 2018, provisions for losses were $12.5 million and $15.8 million, respectively. In addition, the gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 7.5% year-over-year, and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. As a percentage of the average portfolio, financial services expenses were 1.1% in the first quarter of 2023 as compared to 8 -- 0.8% last year. In the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.6%. In the first quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.7% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $300.9 million in the first quarter increased $55.3 million or 22.5% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 25.1% increase in originations of finance receivables and a 9.2% increase in originations of contract receivables. The increase in finance receivable origination reflects the continued strong demand for big ticket products sold by our franchisees during the quarter. Moving to slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.3 billion of gross financing receivables, including $2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for U.S. extended credit compares to 1.6% in 2022. On a sequential basis, the rate is down 10 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience between the fourth and first quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $45.1 million represented 2.46% of outstandings at the end of the first quarter. While this was up 12 basis points from a year ago, it is 45 basis points lower than year-end 2019. Now turning to slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $301.6 million in the quarter compared to $193.9 million last year. The increase from the first quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, improved net earnings and lower cash tax and compensation payments. Net cash used by investing activities of $72.9 million included net additions to finance receivables of $49.6 million and capital expenditures of $23 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $152.1 million included cash dividends of $86.1 million and the repurchase of 356,000 shares of common stock for $87.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $345.4 million of common stock under existing authorizations. Turning to slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $20.7 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 61 days at 2022 year-end. Inventories increased $16 million from 2022 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.5 at year-end 2022. The growth in inventory primarily reflects higher demand, including inventories to support new products as well as critical industry projects. Additionally, to better assure availability given the dynamics of the current supply chain situation, our level of safety stocks and in-transit parts components and raw materials are up as our year-over-year costs associated with finished goods. Our quarter end cash position of $833.8 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 7.4% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter-end, there are no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there are no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I\u2019ll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo, for that detailed financial review. Well, at Snap-on\u2019s first quarter, it is an encouraging performance, demonstrating clearly the breadth, the depth and the length of our extraordinary advance. The breadth, progress across each of the operating groups. C&I, gaining on the challenge of customized kits amidst supply turbulence and rising above the difficulties of geographic reach in troubled times. Tools Group, continuing its upward trend, taking full advantage of the hot resilient vehicle repair market, reaching yet another margin high. RS&I, riding the wave of vehicle complexity and new model introductions, registering another quarter of profitable growth. The period was positive all across our enterprise. Our quarter also had depth. The record was strong from top to bottom, up and down the P&L. C&I, 11.1% organic growth and the OI margin was 15.3%, up 190 basis points. RS&I, organic sales rising, 13.9% and OI margin, a strong 23.4%, 40 points over last year. The Tools Group organic activity increasing 6.3% more in the U.S., high single digits. And we spoke of the eye-catching brilliance of the Stinger toolbox. Remember -- I mean, it really pops, well, something else that pops is the Tools\u2019 OI margin. It\u2019s something to catch attention. It pops like a neon sign, 24.5%, up 180 basis points directly against 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. All that added up to strength across the corporation, organic sales advancing 10.2%, up big, even in the uncertainty, OI margin, 22% -- 22%, representing a rise of 170 basis points. And the final tally of it all, EPS, it was $4.60, up by a clear distance over any comparison. And finally, our performance is marked by length, by the extended positive trend. It was the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating gain. The world is evolving as we thought it would. New equipment and software being needed to follow the acceleration of model change and new technologies. The vehicle repair market is looking like it\u2019s approaching a golden age, more technicians, wages rising, collective and individual optimism across the sector. And we sought our momentum extending in the quarter, a positive view that was confirmed by the voice of the franchisees. And moving forward, we believe that the momentum will continue. And we are confident -- we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re positioned to make the most of the abundant opportunities, growing and improving. We\u2019ve done it period after period, and we did it again in the first quarter. You see, we do have device of advantages in our product, authored by customer connection and innovation, easing the way for critical path, making a clear difference with professionals. We have an advantage in our brand, marking the serious and the professional, bringing pride and dignity, like no other name. And we have an advantage in our people, our team, challenge tested and fully dedicated. And we believe the resilient markets and these considerable advantages will enable Snap-on to maintain its momentum and continue its rise into the second quarter, throughout 2023 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, it\u2019s appropriate that I speak to our franchisees and associates, our team. I know many of you are listening. This quarter is encouraging, but those who would ask why or how need only look to all of you. For the considerable part you played in this performance, you have my congratulations. For the extraordinary commitment you\u2019ve given to our team, you have my admiration. And for the unfailing confidence you hold in Snap-on future, you have my thanks. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And this morning\u2019s first question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I was curious, Nick, about the C&I kind of showing some stepped up organic growth there. You talked about the supply chain easing a little bit. So curious what -- if you\u2019re seeing past due backlog kind of diminish here and where you are in that stage? And is overall backlog continuing to grow because it sounds like the breadth is becoming quite assertive. Nick Pinchuk : Backlog is still pretty strong. I mean, the 11.1%, the increase -- by the way, it was bigger than that really in the critical industries. So that wasn\u2019t borne out of the backlog. Pretty much the backlog is still there. And what you\u2019re seeing is our getting some of the repair challenges underway. I\u2019m not declaring complete victory over the supply turbulence but it looks a lot better this quarter than it has in the past. Plus, you got the military coming back in that period. The military was down before. So you have those two factors driving critical industries upwards, and that\u2019s pretty good. And it isn\u2019t -- we still have a pretty strong backlog sitting there. Orders just keep going. Everybody likes to have customized products. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And in the press release, you mentioned the period continues the Snap-on value creation process and you referred to considerable capacity for improvement. Could you elaborate on some of the specifics that undergird that statement? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. We could be a lot more efficient in selling off the vans. This is one of the reasons that altered our business going upwards in the Tools Group on the principal components of driving it upwards, we could do better than that. Our factories could be more efficient because they\u2019re chockablock. They\u2019re up to their eyeballs. We\u2019re trying to expand them. So we\u2019re working on the expansion, and we\u2019re pounding the RCI into those expansions. So we better -- that will help us quite a bit. So, you see that. And I think in a lot of ways, RCI applies to the Tools business, to the Product business because that\u2019s the complexity in repair goes up. It needs new products. And having a large number of new products really necessitates a real focus on RCI and the actual customer connection and innovation process and so, will drive that through. So fundamentally, we see a lot of opportunities. Our business is sort of like that, Chris. We sort of structurally have opportunities because we have 85,000 SKUs. We\u2019re pretty vertically integrated in a lot of places, sometimes in some cases, raw steel comes in the back of the factory and through a number of different processes from forging all the way to plating to make it look like jewels and putting in the hands of the end user, we have tremendous verticality. So, we have horizontal, 85,000 SKUs and a verticality. That creates a lot of interest for continuous improvement. So we have lots of confidence in our ability to do better. Christopher Glynn : Great. If I could sneak one more in, just want to go a little deeper into the military that had been soft for some time, and it sounds like it\u2019s a pretty sharp and resetting levels there. Just curious if you could give some color on -- I think lumpiness is part of the military story, too. So just curious how to factor that aspect here. Nick Pinchuk : I think we\u2019re seeing an encouraging situation. I mean, we were spitting blood all over the military in the quarters -- further quarters. It was a big negative for us, it was really not there. But now it seems to have come back in a number of different projects, and they\u2019re not huge projects, they\u2019re smaller projects. So this is kind of a -- we interpret it as an opening of the spicket. Every time -- the guys in military tell me this every time a new administration comes in, regardless of who it is, there\u2019s a new sheriff in town, they raise -- we\u2019re going to have new procedures, the new procedures actually don\u2019t work. And so eventually, the war fighters say, I need tools, and therefore, the spicket opens. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening now. Operator : And the next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Bret Jordan : I think you called out sort of strength in some of the higher ticket items. Could you give us some more color on that sort of what the hand tools versus high ticket and then storage versus diagnostics within the higher ticket product mix? Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Look, hand tools are about -- just with the growth this period. So, if you\u2019re looking for mix, there\u2019s really not a mix story along the product lines, we don\u2019t see. If you step back, you look at it, there\u2019s a lot of product, particularly hand tools, they\u2019re about equal to our growth, give or take, equal to our growth. And in terms of big ticket, you got diagnostics being stronger than tool storage because we just introduced and we introduced the big Zeus -- ZEUS+, I think it\u2019s $12,000. This is a monster, the top-of-the-line handheld diagnostic. And so that\u2019s been selling robustly. And you see that together with tool storage in the originations this quarter. So I think for the selling off -- the selling to the franchisees quarter, you\u2019re seeing a good big ticket -- a little bit more or more with diagnostics this quarter than in past quarters because of the Zeus launch. And then you see hand tools kind of keeping pace with the average. Everybody else is the -- the other cats and dogs are floating around it. Bret Jordan : Okay. And then a question on the credit business, I mean, obviously, underlying rates have come up and your -- I think your yield was 17.7 or so. Is there the potential to bring your yields up? I mean, can you pass through some of the higher base rates on those loans? Or is that... Nick Pinchuk : I want to answer this question, but Aldo needs to have at least one question. So, I\u2019ll let\u2026 Aldo Pagliari : Bret, probably not. And the reason for that is we hold our rates. They\u2019re not the lowest rates in the world. They are reflective of the credit profile of the customers that we serve. So they certainly are competitive in the segment where we play. But our rates have been kind of steady over the decade, not just the years, decade, and we\u2019re funded long, as you probably recall. And therefore, we don\u2019t have the same upward pressure on our cost of funds for the next several years. So, as a result of that, we tend to hold the program steady. So the uptick you see right now really is probably reflective a little bit of the slightly better profile of customers as maybe compared to a year or so ago, but it\u2019s very slight, right, 17.6 to 17.7. Bret Jordan : Okay. And one last question for you then on the cost input side. Are you seeing -- what\u2019s the cadence? And whether it\u2019s metals pricing or labor, obviously shipping has come down, but how are you seeing the input cost cadence trending? Aldo Pagliari : So look, the cost is similar -- similar, there\u2019s slight pockets of improvement. Every once in a while, you still have to resort to a spot buy and you\u2019re looking at materials. So, I\u2019d say the most broadly speaking, as I think we said earlier, is that there\u2019s some improvement, but every day, you have to remain agile, flexible. There\u2019s always a new challenge when you walk in the door. So, modest improvement, but still, you got to bring all your resources to the table to effectively manage it. Operator : And the next question comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : I have a question for Aldo, so the second question. Nick Pinchuk : Oh, no. Gary Prestopino : Well, I got one for you, too. In the other category, Aldo, there was a $15.2 million looks like positive and you tax effect that, it\u2019s about, I think, $0.20 of earnings, $0.21 of earnings. What exactly is that? Aldo Pagliari : I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re looking at other income, but if we\u2019re looking at that\u2026 Gary Prestopino : Yes. Aldo Pagliari : Actually, believe it or not, Gary, on the cash that we have on hand, we\u2019re earning a much higher level of interest income than what we did last year. You might remember, about a year ago, you\u2019re getting hardly nothing on your money. Now effectively, the corporation is earning about 4.75% on whatever cash it does have. Gary Prestopino : Okay. All right. So that explains that. And then I just want to get a question on the diagnostics and the software. Nick, it\u2019s growing. Are you finding that there are shops that -- and I don\u2019t -- can\u2019t believe that this is possible that did not have any diagnostic capabilities that are rapidly adapting it because of the more of the electronics on the models, or are entities just looking to upgrade and buy a more powerful machine? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I mean, look, I think the -- sure, there are shops that don\u2019t have diagnostics. I mean, there are guys who think they can do it themselves. And by the way, you can repair it yourself, but it takes more time. And so the more experienced technicians think they can get through in some of them, particularly in truck shops, you\u2019ll see that more. But generally, diagnostics are an upgrade and they\u2019re upgrading the software. And what happens, the good thing about this, like I say in the remarks, is the more drive by wire, the more you need more advancements in both the software and the hardware. It\u2019s one of the reasons why the ZEUS+ has been such a baffle hit, is that it really does move everything forward, bigger screens, make it easier from a hardware point of view, and it\u2019s got enhanced software. And we tried to emphasize that. We keep coming up with ideas like Mitchell 1, like the wiring diagrams for trucks. That may not sound like much, but it\u2019s bad because if you have to keep -- it\u2019s really helpful because if you have to keep trying to find the wire in a new view, it\u2019s a real puzzle sometimes, and they\u2019re holding about collision. Collision is booming. And so writing software for collision, we\u2019re kind of, I think in kind of one of the only few they\u2019re trying to do that, and we see that being very positive. So there\u2019s a lot of opportunity flow through there. Most of it, though, it really depends on the shop. If you\u2019re talking about just the vehicle repair shop, most of them are upgrading what they have already. In some cases, the shop certainly has something. That would be -- in some cases, you\u2019re adding technicians that are using more diagnostics or don\u2019t have a diagnostic now, they\u2019re borrowing. In other cases, if you look at truck or collision repair, they\u2019re just starting to get diagnostics. That\u2019s a little more fertile ground for it. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then as you sell these higher-ticket diagnostic products, I would assume that the software package that comes with it or is associated with it is also a higher ticket versus the low-end diagnostic. Nick Pinchuk : I\u2019ll tell you what, Gary, I don\u2019t know how we can afford to sell it for the price we do. But we do -- we view it as a high value, but yes, the software is more -- when you buy the initial package, you get software for a period of time, like six months in the package. And so then you could take a subscription then that will start after six months or you can wait till six months over and take a subscription or you can wait for six months and buy a title. But if you\u2019re talking about let\u2019s take a look at the discrete purchase would be like buy a title, which would be six months of new software, Zeus higher than the next level down and the next level down. So, it\u2019s higher. Gary Prestopino : And just lastly, do you foresee a situation where as more EVs proliferate through the car park that you would develop a diagnostic tool that\u2019s just specific for EVs? Nick Pinchuk : Sure. But -- yes, that\u2019s a long time off there because first, what would happen is a diagnostic unit that would handle internal combustion and EVs because they\u2019re going to be sharing the space for a long time. They\u2019re going to be chewing the same dirt on a highway for a long time. And so, the real thing is you\u2019re going to need a broad group of that, both in software and tools. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Eventually, EVs may take over a plug-in hybrids or whatever evolves in that situation, and that will move the car part. But it\u2019s a long way process. There\u2019s no singularity in here. But once they start to get some presence in the market, you have to start including them in your diagnostic software so that you help the technicians deal with them as you help them deal with the 650-horsepower BMW M5 competition. Operator : Thank you. And the next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. Elizabeth Suzuki : First, I wanted to ask about the financing arm. In terms of your outlook, I mean, do you see risk to originations, if your customers start shifting from some of these bigger ticket items smaller ticket and as credit conditions more broadly kind of tighten, does that have an impact on your customers\u2019 ability or willingness to take on additional debt for those large purchases. Nick Pinchuk : Actually, I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a big question. There\u2019s a lot of hypotheticals in there. I don\u2019t think we see a risk right now. People seem to be robust in terms of the big ticket items. One of the messages of our point is I think I said when we were at the conference, there almost seems to be two economies, the financial economy and the physical economy. And the physical economy right now seems pretty pumped to me. And so we see -- and we see that with the take-up of big-ticket items that expresses their confidence. Really, and in past downturns, it hasn\u2019t been the rates that influenced because our rates stay the same. It hasn\u2019t been the rates or the actual money that -- of technicians that influences the choice. It\u2019s their mental view. The paraphrase is -- what was [Technical Difficulty] election. It\u2019s a psychology. And so basically, in the great financial recession, it was the -- we would have said economies glum repair shops hum. And they kept going. And so yes, but they were getting up every day, getting bad news for breakfast on all the shows and reading the paper. So, they were worried about taking long-term long payback items, but they had the money. So, I don\u2019t anticipate the money going away, but I -- but they could change their attitude, depending on how much bombardment occurs. I think really, that\u2019s how we see the world playing out. Repair is essential. It keeps going. But the mentality of the customers can shift between big ticket and small ticket. We saw -- I mean, it\u2019s evidence that you go back to just out of the COVID -- coming out of the COVID everybody had money and garages and never stopped, but they were focused on small ticket items, not big ticket. And when they started to get more comfortable and they had the psychological recovery and exhilaration, they started to go big ticket. That\u2019s what we see now. Elizabeth Suzuki : Yes. Got it. No, it certainly makes sense that the sentiment is a little different here on Wall Street than it is on Main Street. So I get that. All right. Thank you for that. Operator : And the next question comes from Scott Stember with ROTH MKM. Scott Stember : Nick, you\u2019re talking about how collision is booming. I just wanted to flesh that out a little bit. How much of it is just from, I guess, a volume standpoint at the collision level, which I guess you could see with increased purchases of on the car or just collision equipment versus increased demand of diagnostics for ADAS for the collision side. Nick Pinchuk : It\u2019s both of those. I think increasingly in the collision area is people are more and more interested in -- as we go forward in the sort of like the ADAS situation where you\u2019re talking about calibration and setting the neural network of sensors. And also, things like we talked about with Mitchell 1 with the special collision focused software because people are seeing that job more and more. Two things are happening -- three things are happening, I suppose. The first one is a lot of different materials in a car now. So you just can\u2019t bend steel, you have to cut different like carbon fiber and so on. So, there\u2019s a lot of different physical products that we sell that make that. That was -- that\u2019s a longstanding trend. And then as the neural networks have become more ubiquitous, they need a lot of software and hardware that\u2019s focused on that to recalibrate and do that. And then thirdly, collision jobs are getting more jobs because the collision has taken more time. If you don\u2019t think that -- when you hammer your bumper, see how much it costs you, how long it takes you to get it replaced. Those are taking more time. So, there\u2019s more work for collision jobs. So they\u2019re seeing three factors : one, the material; two, addressing the neural network; and three, just handling the volume and getting productivity. Scott Stember : Got it. And just housekeeping in the Tools segment, sell into the van channel versus sell-through, were they pretty much in line? Nick Pinchuk : They were in line, pretty well balanced this quarter. They go up and down, but we\u2019re pretty -- we pretty much feel as though they\u2019re kind of matching up, and they have. They fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. But this quarter is evenly keeled. Maybe there\u2019s a little bit more selling off the van that\u2019s selling into there, maybe a little bit, but not anything significant. So, [Technical Difficulty] pretty solid. Scott Stember : All right. And just last question, just going back to Bret\u2019s question about the, I guess, the composition of the Tools Group. It sounds that tools were up -- or hand tools were up in line with the overall segment. Can you maybe just talk about anything to point out new products out there, or is it different selling tactics? Is it bundling of certain things? Just trying to see what\u2019s there. Nick Pinchuk : A lot of different things. I mean, fundamentally, the big kahuna in the Tools Group this time is ZEUS+, big ticket item, $12,000. So that\u2019s rolling through that business. And so that\u2019s the thing that gets your attention. I talked about this Neon Stinger, and I really meant it. It was flying off the shelf. We showed it at our kickoff and people loved it because [Technical Difficulty] and technicians want to make a statement. So tool storage has got some nice products. So you have a new model and diagnostic that\u2019s driving that. You have some really nice innovations in tool storage. And in hand tools, you have a number of different things, some of which are things like new pliers. We have a range of new pliers that everybody loves. I was talking to the franchisees, like I said, a couple of weeks ago. And these guys whipped out these pliers and started talking about how great they are and easy to sell because they\u2019re so functional, how in grip. They hold on really well, three positions, so you can handle any kind of job. People love them. So you see that. Plus we\u2019re bundling some things like impact sockets, putting together some impact sockets where they weren\u2019t bundled before. So people -- impact sockets are things you use for very hard and difficult like trucks, you really need a lot of power. So the sockets have to be of a different dimension, less hard but stronger, thicker wall and those kinds of things. So, we see those coming out, maybe focused on the truck shop. So those are the kinds of things that are driving the situation. But it\u2019s always that way. There\u2019s always a story around products. Operator : Our next question comes from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Let me start off by just asking about the revenue mix overall. Are you seeing a shift in the percentage of revenues from technicians versus independent garage owners and dealerships? Nick Pinchuk : Not really. I mean, you could say this. Let me say this. Only in this way, not in the Tools Group for sure. I don\u2019t see it in the Tools group. You could argue that, all right, you tend to get garage owners who are also technicians, they are the probably number one buyer of a ZEUS+. So in that way, you might see more of that. But every time you roll out the top of the line diagnostic unit, you\u2019re seeing that. So adjusting for our expectations in that way, I don\u2019t see any change in the Tools Group. If you go to RS&I, while repairs -- software and diagnostic sales to independent repair shops were up, the two big pounders in RS&I was the OEM businesses following the new models and the equipment. But equipment is split between -- pretty much equally between garages and independent. So generally, you\u2019ll see a slight shading toward OEM garages on the RS&I side. You won\u2019t see any -- much of a mix change on the tools side except for the fact that ZEUS+ seems to always -- the big kahuna always sells, has a strong shop by. That\u2019s pretty much it. Other than that, we don\u2019t see any changes. David MacGregor : Just staying on the garage owners for a minute, Nick. Your contract receivable is up 9.2%. You sense that garage owners are maybe starting to face a little more difficulty securing credit, returning to Snap-on credit as an alternative? Aldo Pagliari : For -- the contract receivables are with the franchisees and the van leases and inventory. So, that\u2019s\u2026 David MacGregor : Yes. So, let\u2019s throw them in there as well and just say, is this group facing any more of a challenge on secure credit? Nick Pinchuk : David, it\u2019s a logical extension of -- higher credit maybe. But I\u2019m not hearing it. I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re a windshield guy, too. I mean, I don\u2019t hear it in my windshield surveys, nobody is saying that. And I would just offer, our impression was based on how our franchisees are and how they say the technicians are is the balance sheets are pretty robust. So yes, that might happen, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing it happen now. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s occurring right now. I think this is a pretty robust sector. We haven\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t see it get manipulated during the great [Technical Difficulty] they were more cautious, but they were still pretty plush. So I don\u2019t know. Could happen, but I don\u2019t hear it anyway. David MacGregor : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just on storage and maybe any of the other categories where you\u2019ve got large backlogs. Can you just give us some sense of how far back those backlogs are extending and... Nick Pinchuk : Too far. That\u2019s why we\u2019re spending -- factories. Look, that is -- I was at these franchisees. I don\u2019t know, you can take this around many grains, so if you wish, but these guys are telling me they can sell every tool storage box they get. Backlogs go back. I don\u2019t want to really get into that. Sorry. But it\u2019s pretty substantial, probably longer than we would like. But sometimes we wonder -- I\u2019d tell you what, just a key -- looking at sometimes we wonder it is better if the backlog is long. It makes people want them more. I don\u2019t know. You know what I mean? Because everybody wants a Snap-on box, it seems. So maybe it just makes it more attractive, like if you have to wait for a car for a long time. But we\u2019d like to bring this backlog down. That\u2019s why we are enhancing our factories in all categories really. Virtually all of our product lines are up to the eyeballs and trying to turn out the factories. But the one that chases the most is tool storage because everywhere we go, people say, I need more. I need more. I need more. David MacGregor : Is there a reason then, Nick, why at the regional kickoffs you were offering discount packages on storage? It seems odd that you\u2019d be discounting something as backlog. Nick Pinchuk : Because we offer discount packages all the time. That\u2019s part of the reason to buy now. You could say, okay, you don\u2019t have to have the discount package. But in reality -- in reality, David, our franchisees are conditioned to sell off a kind of deal. Our art is to make that deal attractive but leaner or richer depending on how we want to move the product. David MacGregor : Got it. Last question for me is just, I guess, given the strength in big-ticket sales, Nick, combined with -- whether you\u2019re on Wall Street or Main Street, there\u2019s a slowing macro out there. I guess, what gives you confidence you aren\u2019t pulling forward technician purchasing power that adversely impacts hand tools sales and future growth at some point down the road? Nick Pinchuk : Actually, I don\u2019t worry so much about hand tools. I don\u2019t. I mean, hand tools have been strong come hell or high water. I mean I think -- I mean I only been here 15 years. So maybe that\u2019s not long enough. But the thing is it seems though hand tools -- if you\u2019re talking about the longer payback items, like I was talking to Liz, sooner or later, sometimes, the psychology of it all breaks through and even the guys who are working every day and pulling in the money, they say, I want to keep my powder dry for a while, sometimes. But that\u2019s a psychological balance, which I think right now there\u2019s tremendous reservoirs of optimism in the people of work. It\u2019s different than the big companies. If you look at the National Association of Manufacturers and you look at small manufacturers versus large manufacturers, there\u2019s all of a sudden a big divide between them in terms of their optimism, their outlook. The small guys have almost never been higher. So, I think this is part of what it is. I think there\u2019s a lot of talk. As you say, there\u2019s a lot of talk and just we saw -- I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s wrong or anything like that. But when you walk in -- when I walk in a garage or meet the franchisees, they\u2019re saying, who\u2019s this guy? Is this guy, Paul? I don\u2019t even know who he is. David MacGregor : Well, it was a good quarter. Congratulations, Nick. Operator : And the last question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : Thanks for getting me in here. I know we\u2019re maybe a little limited for time, so I\u2019ll just ask one question today. And what I was really hoping to understand is, Nick or Aldo, you could just unpack the gross margin gains we saw both in the Tools Group and C&I this quarter a little bit more. Especially what I\u2019m hoping to understand how much normalization we\u2019re seeing right now in the margin in terms of price and what\u2019s going on with material costs and whether you think that\u2019s sustainable or even there might be more opportunity as we go from here. Thanks. Nick Pinchuk : Well, look, -- I like to do this. So I\u2019ll do this. Look, in C&I it\u2019s simple. Critical industries, boomshakalaka!. Critical industries are the highest margin business in that area. And the margins are robust and they did pretty well. And like we talked about the military and I don\u2019t know if you heard that call, but the military tends to be -- is the base by base type of product we\u2019re getting that\u2019s moving it. And that tends to be pretty good. So I think that\u2019s one factor you\u2019re seeing there. That\u2019s pretty strong. They were up -- the critical industries were up greater than 11%. And that\u2019s what drove the margins I think, principally, There were other things. I mean another thing is that generally, the supply chain is getting better, but some of the stuff you go out and buy a whole bunch of stuff on -- when you spot [ph] buy, you buy a lot because you don\u2019t want to have to not have them. So some of that stuff is working its way through. So it\u2019s a very complex mix. We are seeing some abatement. That should continue. But mostly, the big factor there, the 190 basis points had to do with critical industries doing well. The customized kits are great for us and they sold -- we broke some of the bottlenecks, and we did well in that situation. So that\u2019s C&I. If you look at Tools Group, it\u2019s -- there\u2019s no product mix story that I think guys were wondering; if there were, it wasn\u2019t that. But it is the fact that there is an attenuation in the commodities, so the commodities, which Tools Group is very vertically integrated, so they buy commodities in a lot of situations. So they get a nice pop from that. And so, they\u2019re getting some improvement in that situation. Of course, they\u2019re taking their foot off the pricing in concert with that. And then the Tools Group has been hammering away at RCI. So, you see a lot of that happening in this situation. So, we think the whole thing is sustainable. Now that -- I\u2019m not telling you that the OI margin for the Tools Group is going to be the same next quarter, but we don\u2019t think they can\u2019t -- we believe they could go higher. Not necessarily next quarter, but we think there\u2019s room to move up from RCI and a rationalization of the situation. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to return the floor to Sara Verbsky for any closing comments. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll start the call by as usual, by covering the highlights of the second quarter, and I'll give you my perspective on the environment and the trends we're seeing. A long way we'll cover the markets. They're encouraging actually. And I'll take you through the segments and the advancements we've made. Then Aldo will provide a detailed review of the financials. We see the second quarter as a period of significance. Sometimes you see a performance where you breakthrough into new heights. And this is one of those times. I'm going to tell you why we believe that to be true. In some ways, though, it was similar. This period was similar to many periods we've seen over time, as we continue to have significant headwinds. And there's always turbulence variation from market-to-market. But we believe it's our job to confront and overcome these obstacles, and we did just that in the second quarter by wielding the strength of our advantages, executing on our strategic runways for growth, making the most of our runways for improvement, and by relying on the skills and dedication of our people. And once again, it paid off the numbers screen it's sold, but here they are. As reported, second quarter sales of $1,191.3 billion were up 4.8% from 2022, including the impact of $8.3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic activity was up 5.6%. The 12 straight quarter of year-over-year expansion beyond pre-pandemic levels. That's a trend that demonstrates that we believe it is a solid consistency during pretty uncertain times. Now let's talk about the earnings. OpCo operating income for the quarter, including the effects of unfavorable foreign currency was $277 million, up 12.3%. And our OpCo operating margin, the operating margin -- it was 23.3%, up 160 basis points from last year, BAFO. When I said new levels, I mean it. For financial services, the OI of $66.9 million represented an increase of $1.6 million, and it all combined to author an overall consolidated operating margin of 26.8% up 130 basis points from last year. And the second quarter EPS, it was $4.89, up $0.62 or 14.5% from last year's $4.27. I think I'll say it again, $4.89, up 14.5%. The productivity and profitability of Snap-on operations shining through as the supply chain viscosity diminished. We believe Snap-on is stronger now than ever before, and the quarter's profitability makes that crystal clear. Well, those are the overall numbers. Now let's speak to the market, auto repair. Again, this quarter, it's favorable. Miles driven are up. Spending on vehicle maintenance, up. Technician count, up. Technician wages, up. Consistently positive year-over-year trajectory across all these central categories. Drivers in vehicle repair are fairly understood. Car parks growing, getting older every year, and every year, the tests involved in maintaining and repair the vehicle park get increasingly complex, requiring more hours, greater scale, increased wages and more sophisticated tools, hands or power or data-driven tools. There's a significant need for more technicians and greater capabilities. The competition for that talent is growing, and it's being reflected in the rising wages at an everyday level. I think you can see this demand when you're trying to schedule a maintenance appointment or just by visually seeing abundant of cars and trucks in the repair base or parked outside, crowded around the shops waiting for their turn to get in. And in fact, just this month as with a group of franchisees and customers in Bristol, Tennessee, the NHRA Thunder nationals, the drag races, and they energetically expressed their enthusiasm during our conversations. You can feel their optimism resonating with an appreciation for our products, our solutions, and how we make work easier. So we expect that the trajectory of vehicle repair is solid. And we'll continue through the quarters and on into the years ahead, we expect that vehicle repair is the -- we believe that vehicle repair is a great place to operate and the repair information -- our Repair Information Group and our Tools Group are well positioned to take advantage of that. Now on to the critical industries or our commercial and industrial group or C&I takes our business out of the garage and solves to have a consequence where the penalty for failure is high in a wide range of sectors, where custom tools are often required to get the job done. This is also the segment where we have a most significant international presence, and the attended variations from country-to-country with many versions of economic and social headwinds. In the U.S., the landscape actually is pretty positive. We see progress across a number of sectors. Aerospace is strong. Increased demand in commercial aviation and momentum within space that cover exploration. The military business was another strong quarter of growth now better matching actual needs. Natural resources continue to advance in oil and gas and wind after the uncertainty of the last fall, energy repair is a positive place to be. Also begin the period with industrial transportation. Supply chain turbulence, I think has raised the attention on rail and heavy-duty fleets, society now more than ever sees the essential need to keep commercial supply moving and it's accruing positively for us. Now there are tepid spots across the globe. Place is traumatized by the Ukraine war, we see that weaknesses in some of the agent Pacific operations. But one of the clear and large positives in the period is the general rise of critical industries. And our industrial division is well positioned and it's taking advantage with this capability to customize products to a large number of applications, and it's working. Our critical industry teams are on an upward trajectory utilizing their capability and the enhanced capacity to capture significant gains. Overall, the story of Snap-on outside the garage looks quite promising. And as we move forward, we'll continue to capitalize on an abundant potential. And as part of that, we'll keep engaging Snap-on value creation, customer connection and innovation, developing profitable new products and solutions delivered by the insights and knowledge gains standing next to the customers right in the work place and will drive RCI all over the enterprise, including in the Tools Group. We will keep working to increase our franchisee selling capacity with efficient processes, with advanced training programs, with social media and digital content and expanded manufacturing capacity to meet the rising demand all combining to take full advantage of the opportunities and continue the positive trends we've seen into the future. Well, that's a market overview. Now let's move to the segments. For the C&I Group, as reported sales rose 1.4%, including $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency. Organic volume was up by 3%. A quite strong performance in the industrial division was attenuated by shortfalls in some of our more challenged areas. Power tools had smaller volumes as customers anticipated the arrival of new products in the third quarter. Our European-based hand tool business, SNA Europe, but our Asia-Pacific operations demonstrated growth in several markets, but softness in Eastern Europe and currency pressure in Japan and the yen was weak was some offset. But our industrial vision isn't just growing in volume. The margins are strong and rising. Customized product is a wonderful thing. So C&I OI was $68.1 million, a 12.4% increase over last year. And the operating margin was 16%, one of the highest ever for the group, representing a gain of 160 basis points over the second quarter of last year. The industrial division wielding the capacity provided by our new building in Kenosha registered significant sales progress. In April, we discussed the recoveries of the military business in the military segment. In this quarter, we continued that momentum, capturing significant long-term contracts, our product line, wide and effective produced in the U.S. made the difference. So we believe things look promising for the military business and for all of our industrial segments. Beyond the industrial division and C&I, our specialty tools operation continue to advance, meeting the need for precision with new torque products, covering a vast spectrum of clamping forces for challenging applications. Torque accuracy is rising an importance and Snap-on is ready to capitalize. We are confident and committed to extending in critical industries, and that conviction is anchored by the ongoing expansion of our lineup of innovative products, explicitly designed for particular tasks, offerings like our automated tool control or ATC enabled by proprietary digital imaging technology that scans toolbox, drawers, recording in real time, which tools are required are removed to replace. It's an increasingly crucial feature for aerospace for industrial manufacturing and for commercial transportation operations. Imagine working out of plan or a locomotive engine and unknowingly leaving a tool behind in the workplace. Not good, not good. This is a mistake that could result in a failure in any tight tolerance mechanism, one small item can be a huge problem. Well, ATC has an answer, keeping track of the tools, identifying missing items, tracing who signed them out and where are those to be used and giving the all clear when everything is returned. So the plans can take off. Snap-on critical industries are on the rise and ATC is part of the reason. And in the quarter, we released our next generation of ATC, a larger touchscreen to improve the shop productivity and upgraded processes with the latest technology for seamless integration with any central IT system. And as you might expect, our customers were enthusiastic, sophisticated products for complex products. It's a winning combination for C&I, and you can see it in the quarter's results. Now on to the Tools Group. Organic sales grew 1.1%, which includes 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. Growth in the international markets and a slight improvement in the U.S. network. Based on our franchisees and customer feedback, like I said already, vehicle repair is robust. But in the period, our record demand met capacity constraints before our plant expansion, so we're fully operational, limiting some of the potential possibilities and somewhat attenuating the volumes. But for operating earnings, payrolls in the quarter by $13.3 million or 10.7% reaching $137.7 million. That's almost double the pre-pandemic level. The operating margin was 26.3%, a rise of 240 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. Let me say that again, Tools Group OI margin was 26.3% [indiscernible] this is an eye-popping number. So the Tools Group had another positive quarter with substantial profitability. We are confident in the strength of our van network and that believe is borne out of quantitative evidence, franchisee health metrics. We monitor them regularly every quarter. And again, this quarter, they remained strong. So what are you talking about talking to the franchisees at Thunder Valley or looking at the numbers, vehicle repair does appear robust and continues to be so. Now when you think of the Tools Group profitability, which is a pretty important subject this time. You think about hand tools, that high margin lineup was -- they were up -- that was up in the period. And new products led the way. One example of successful innovation that came from another customer connection was a number of franchisees observed that diesel technicians struggling to access sensors on Class 8 semi-trucks that were struggling to do that. So to change the part without risking damage. The path had to be cleared by removing several other blocking components. Believe me, that's a time-consuming process. And so armed with customer connection insights, those customer connection insights. Our engineers developed an innovative design, quickly produced a 3D prototype and confirm that it solved the problem. And that 3D tool, SWR5 90-degree special Crowfoot Wrench is being made right now at our Elizabethton Tennessee plant, and it's getting a lot of attention. It really does make truck repair easier. The techs love it, and we kind of like the margins. Profitable customer connection is one of the drivers behind the Tools Group success. And another example of this quarter is our two piece horizontal bushing adapter set. The BJP1 BKS2 [ph], these names are something, text at a Subaru dealership where they were taking a lot of time to remove and store control arm bushings from suspension setups on the newer models. Our team assessed the procedure and designed two new adapters to integrate with our existing ball joint press, and that enabled the fit for the new -- a good bit for the new suspension and say two hours in repair time per procedure, that's a big savings in the garage generated by customer connection and innovation. SNL a while ago, SNL's [indiscernible] said, it's always something. And it's true. There are always new repair challenges, whether the powertrain is internal combustion, plug-in hybrids or EV platforms. Vehicle architecture is getting tighter, packed with more devices, creating additional accessibility constraints, it's all music to our ears. Our franchisees and engineers observe the work, identify complications and simplify the complex and multifaceted tasks to raise efficiency and keep the world moving. And the attendant value is considerable. You can see that in the Tools Group profits. Now one of the highlights of the quarter was the continuing growth of our big ticket sales. A sign of technician confidence in the vehicle repair shop driving some of that trend was our latest tool storage unit, the KMP1023ZLT7, a 72-inch Master Series Roll Cab paining with a unique apparent scheme we call green envy, a break green body paired with black trim. It stands out and makes a statement in any repair shop, but beyond the eye-popping optics the box is also a productivity enhancing powerhouse equipment, 14 drawers, including three spanning the full width of the unit putting the most important tools of any size right at hand. It also offers our popular power drawer and dedicated space equipment. I guess five power outlets and two USB ports for charging a full array of core accessories. And for the hard to manage small parts, our 2-inch speed drawer, makes for easy organization with green NV color coordinated dividers, custom slots for components of various sizes. The box is already one of our hit products. It really energize franchisees and was well received by our customers. And as I said, it helped keep the big ticket train moving. Well, that's the Tools Group, strong profitability, built on solid foundations of innovative products and franchisee success. Mixed with a considerable portion of RCI gain. Now visible as supply that RCI gain is now clearly visible as a supply chain turbulence receives. And now let's go on to RS&I. Sales as reported reached $452 million that represented a $35.2 million or 8.4% increase. Gains in the equipment and OEM essential programs paired with -- gains in equipment and OEM paired with our successful rollout of our new handheld diagnostic platform. The OI in the period was $110.4 million, up 14.7% or 15.4%. Up $14.7 million or 15.4%, and the operating margin was 24.4%, a rise of 140 basis points. Nice. Nice. As we said, the vehicle repair environment is strong, offering significant opportunity and the second quarter results for C&I says it's so. And the recent launch of our new SOLUS+ diagnostic platform was a big key to that success. Great new features. including a two second boot up, the fastest in the industry and an 8-inch colored touch free with 60% higher resolution, making it much easier for technicians to view in brighter lighting. It supports the latest communication protocols, and it offers access to SureTrack. That's our library of vehicle-specific real fixes, repair tips and commonly replace parts that wheels our proprietary database of 2.5 billion repair records and 325 billion vehicle events. SOLUS+, the franchisees have been positive, the customers have been excited and the sales have been robust. New powertrains are driving the need for extending product lines, including vehicle lifts, enabling independent shops and dealerships to accommodate the new models. So -- and in meeting this opportunity with advantage, part of RS&I success has been our undercar equipment division. It's one of the drivers between our -- behind RS&I's strong growth. Take our Challenger Lift Operation in Louisville. The plant offers thousands of SKUs matched a separate lifting task and the numbers have been growing to meet the specific challenges of EV lifting. And in the quarter, that facility hosted Chief Executive magazine Smart Manufacturing Summit, and the event underlines the power of product customization and driving expansion and the extraordinary ability of RCI to render that low volume production quite profitable. It's that approach that drove RCI's gains. OI up 140 basis points in the quarter and we expect that it will keep doing just that as we go forward throughout the group and all across Snap-on. RS&I improving position with repair shop owners and managers, growing OEM relationships, expanding the product offerings, welding RCI everywhere, and it all combined to deliver substantial growth and strong profitability. The Snap-on second quarter, continued opportunities in vehicle repair and critical industries, progress along our runways for coherent growth and advancements down our runways for improvement. Overall sales increasing organically 5.6%, margins strong in every segment. OpCo OI margin 23.3%, up 160 basis points overcoming unfavorable currency and EPS $4.89, up versus all comparisons. It was another encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.191 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 4.8% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 5.6% organic sales gain, partially offset by $8.3 million or 80 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency translation. From a geographic perspective, we experienced year-over-year organic sales growth in North and South America as well as Europe, while sales in Asia-Pacific were down low single-digits, mostly due to weakness in the yen contributing to less activity in Japan. Consolidated gross margin improved 200 basis points at 50.7% from 48.7% last year. As gross margins expanded across all of our operating segments, contributions from increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from the company's RCI initiatives were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales are 27.4% compared to 27% last year. The increase of 40 basis points is primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $277 million in the quarter compared to $246.6 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services up 23.3%, including 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, reflects an expansion of 160 basis points over last year. Financial services revenue of $93.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $86.4 million last year, while operating earnings of $66.9 million compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $343.9 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.8% reflects an improvement of 130 basis points from 2022. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 22.9% compared to 23.8% last year. Net earnings of $264 million or $4.89 per diluted share, including $0.09 share impact from unfavorable foreign currency reflected an increase of $32.5 million or $0.62 per share from 2022 levels and represented a 14.5% year-over-year increase in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $364.2 million increased from $359.1 million last year, reflecting a $10.7 million or 3% organic sales gain, which was partially offset by $5.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic growth primarily reflects a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by declines in power tool volumes. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation and heavy-duty sectors. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 39.5% in the second quarter from 37.3% in 2022. This is largely due to increased volumes in the higher gross margin critical industry sector, pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by 40 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 60 basis points to 23.5% in the quarter, from 22.9% in 2022, mostly due to increased sales and higher expense businesses. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $58.1 million compared to $51.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 160 basis points to 16% from 14.4% last year. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales on the Snap-on Tools Group of $523.1 million compared to $520.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 1.1% organic sales gain, partially offset by $3.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a mid single-digit gain in our international operations and slightly higher sales in our U.S. business. Higher sales of hand tools and big ticket items in the quarter were partially offset by lower sales of Power Tools. Gross margin improved 300 basis points to 49% in the quarter from 46% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Material costs benefited from reduced expenses for various steel types used in our product offering. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 60 basis points to 22.7% from 22.1% last year, primarily due to increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $137.7 million, including $3.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $124.4 million last year. The operating margin of 26.3%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 23.9% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 240 basis points. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $452 million compared to $416.8 million in 2022 reflecting an 8.5% organic sales gain, partially offset by $300,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is comprised of a double-digit gain in sales of undercar and collision repair equipment, a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved a 180 basis points to 45% from 43.2% last year, primarily due to increased sales volumes and pricing actions, lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 40 basis points to 20.6% from 20.2% last year, primarily due to increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $110.4 million compared to $95.7 million last year. The operating margin improved 140 basis points to 24.4% from 23% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7 million to $93.4 million from $86.4 million last year, reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $66.9 million, including $200,000 of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $65.3 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $5.4 million from 2022 levels, including $4.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses decreased by about $500,000. For reference, Provisions for finance receivable losses in the current quarter were $13.7 million as compared to $9.1 million in the second quarter last year. In the second quarters of 2019 and 2018, Provisions for losses were $11.9 million and $13.6 million, respectively. In addition, our gross worldwide extended credit of finance receivable portfolio has increased 9.1% year-over-year and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.6% and 17.5%. In the second quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.6% and 8.5%, respectively. Total loan originations of $326.3 million in the second quarter represented an increase of $18.7 million or 6.1% from 2022 levels reflecting a 5.7% increase in originations of finance receivables and an 8.3% increase in originations of contract receivables. Gains in extended credit originations in the U.S. were led by franchisee sales of diagnostic products, including our recently launched SOLUS and ZEUS platforms. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.4 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.1 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.3% for U.S. extended credit compares to 1.4% in 2022. On a sequential basis, the rate is down 20 basis points, reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience in the second quarter. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $46.4 million represented 2.45% of outstandings at quarter end, which is down slightly from the 2.46% reported at the end of last quarter. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $270.3 million in the quarter compared to $140.8 million last year. The improvement as compared to the second quarter of 2022 primarily reflects lower year-over-year increases in working capital investment and higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $94.6 million included net additions to finance receivables of $68.6 million and capital expenditures of $25.8 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $136.5 million included cash dividends of $85.9 million and the repurchase of 359,000 shares of common stock for $94.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $336.7 million of common stock under our existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $25.1 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days was the same as 2022 year-end. Inventories increased $13 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4x compared to 2.5x at year-end 2022. Our quarter end cash position of $871.3 million compared to $757.2 million at year-end 2022. Our net debt-to-capital ratio of 6.5% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $800 million available under our credit facilities. And as of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2023. We anticipate that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full-year 2023 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 24%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's the quarter. RCI shining through as the supply sky is clear to show the new levels of performance. Vehicle repair continuing its strength, critical industry is accelerating RS&I growth, both in -- growth in both dealerships and independent shops, advances in helping customize shops to new vehicles, OI margin, 24.4%, up 140 basis points. Tools Group growth attenuated. But strong new products, solving specific problems, creating extraordinary value and an OI of $137.7 million, almost double pre-pandemic levels and OI margins of 26.3%, up 240 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points of unfavorable currency. C&I extending in the critical industries. We're opening new capacity, achieving broad growth and an OI margin of 16%. 160 basis points over last year, also overcoming unfavorable currency and Snap-on credit, profits up, originations rising indicating broad confidence in vehicle repair, and it came together for an attention getting overall performance. Snap-on organic sales rising 5.6%, an OI margin of 23.3%, up 160 basis points and an EPS of $4.89, new levels indeed. It was an encouraging quarter. And we believe that these results, representing new heights highlight the opportunities in our markets. They're essential, demonstrate the power of our approach. It creates extraordinary value solving the critical. And most of all, confirms the strength and reliability of our team, capable and battle-tested reliability of that team to wield our Snap-on value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement, all to overcome challenges and drive the corporation higher. And we expect that our decisive advantages -- those sets of advantages and opportunities and approach. And then people will author a continuing upward trajectory even beyond these levels throughout the remainder of this year, and on into 2024. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our associates and franchisees, the Snap-on team. I know many of you are listening. These results do represent new heights. But more than that, there are ringing testimony to your unwavering focus on moving our enterprise forward. Your extraordinary achievements, hard one. Yes, my congratulations. For the capability you demonstrate every day, you have my admiration. And for the unshakable confidence you hold in our path forward, you have my thanks. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from Scott Stember with ROTH MKM. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Nick, you talked about in tools that there was, I guess, it sounded like your ability to meet demand in certain areas was not met because of production. Can you maybe talk about that and maybe tie that into the decline that you talked about in Power Tools? Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Sure. Look, I think they're semi-related, but here's the thing. I think we started -- I probably said 12 times in this pitch. We think the market is robust. So you're not seeing the market in those numbers. The situation simply here is rooted in hand tools and tool storage primarily, where generally, the mix of products we got exceeded our capacity. We expected a certain mix. We got a different mix. And part of that was the people saying, well, power tools is going to launch in the future new products. And therefore, power tools is not so popular, and it was down in the quarter, anticipating those power tools. And so we bumped up against capacity, particularly around the more customized models, which are more difficult to build and more difficult to turn out. So that's pretty much what it was. I mean fundamentally, if you look at power tools, I mean, tools in the quarter, hand tools, biggest ever, biggest ever. And you look at tool storage, not only does the tool storage factory have to supply some -- and hand tools are some of this, but tools storage, not only does the tool storage factory, you have to supply the Tools Group. But when you see the acceleration associated with the critical industries that they have boxes as well. And they were expanded. So put a lot of pressure on those factories. So we couldn't able -- we weren't able to follow the market. But -- we had anticipated expansion. Those expansions are starting to be ready now. So the hand tools plant in Milwaukee. We have about two-thirds of the expansion will be ready this month. And in the fourth quarter, the rest of it will be ready. The Elizabethan tool storage -- not tool storage, but the hand tool plant in Elizabethan will have its expansion in the end of the third quarter to fourth quarter, expanding space and the expansion along our tool storage business is starting to get in place sort of the end of this month. So we're expanding the capacity just that in this quarter, the mix of the products pretty much somewhat reflective of power tools being down and, therefore, filling that in with customized products bumped up against demand. Scott Stember : Got it. Okay. And as far as sell into the van sell-through, it sounds as if probably... Nicholas Pinchuk : Pretty good it was above our numbers like it has been for a couple of periods. We like to say that over time, that's all going to even out. But in this quarter, the sell-through was -- fell off the van, we say, was better. Scott Stember : Okay. And you would expect that to balance out as you were surprised? Nicholas Pinchuk : It always balances out. A quarter doesn't mean that much in that situation. But what I'm trying to say is that we still think that demand is pretty strong. You see that when you talk to franchisees and customers themselves. And the whole idea, Scott, is big ticket items are an indication of confidence usually in this market. I mean I suppose it isn't for sure. But generally, in our history, when we've seen big ticket items sell and they did. Originations were up and tool storage had -- I think it's one of its best quarters ever, if you put industrial and tools together, that indicates that customers are willing to enter into those longer payback items. And we also saw a nice range of diagnostics numbers this quarter. So those big ticket items really look good, positive sell-through. And so that indicates because the technicians are willing to enter into those longer payback items. And that as they think at least, that the market is good. Scott Stember : And just to be clear, sales off the van [ph] are stronger right now than into the channel. Got it. All right, that's all I have for now. Thank you. Nicholas Pinchuk : Okay. Operator : Our next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Christopher Glynn : Yes, thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the gross margin, which was very strong. You mentioned supply chain clearing. Is that more or less recovered now? Or does supply chain... Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, every time I have a review, if somebody brings up something that says they got some spot buys still coming through. But in general, like I said, the skies have cleared, and we're going to get a little more benefit, but most of it is out now. Our big problem was, of course, everybody saw commodity prices to go up and freight price to go up. But the big problem for a company like us is we had spot things in a lot of situations, which we're paying 2x or 3x sometimes what the original price was. And so that ends up going in inventory. Just think about it. If you have in trouble getting stuff, you tend to overbuy it sometimes because you want to have it in stock because you want to deliver as the first priority. And so you get yourself in that situation. And so you're seeing that clear. And so what happens in that situation, the advances in new value products and the RCI we've been doing all this time starts to shine through. Christopher Glynn : Great. Thanks for that. And given the expansion at SOT over the past few years and your bandwidth capacity to sell, you've -- I think, grown your actively serviced technicians. I'm wondering, does that reopen the gate to add franchisees and were franchisee -- was U.S. franchisee count? Is that pretty stable, as I understand it to be? Nicholas Pinchuk : It's pretty stable. We're down a few franchisees this quarter, but not many. It's not a factor for government work, Chris. But -- and we're not -- we're probably not going to add people. We believe that our franchisees sell more because we tell them, you're our guys. And if we do well, so you, and so we believe that subdividing their opportunity probably isn't the best alternative. Now we think we have the world covered. We have, what, 3,400 franchisees around the country. So we think we have most of the places covered. I suppose there's the odd place that we might find that we'd add one or two. But really, that's not going to be a program for us. Our way up is to get the guys to be more aggressive and in this instance, to be able to deliver better. We need to -- we're expanding our capacity, so that should relieve some of the problem. But it's a happy problem actually that people saying we're waiting for your tool storage products. Christopher Glynn : Yes. And is franchisee turnover still stable? Nicholas Pinchuk : It's still about the same -- it's about the same. It's about -- I think it's about 10% and you'd say, Chris, what 5% of that is retirements. You'd say 5% is guys pretty much every year, you'll get that. And so 10% is pretty stable. It had been higher sometimes, but now last multiple quarters has been stable, about that number. Christopher Glynn : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor, your line is open. David MacGregor : Here we go. Sorry about that, it was on mute. Good morning everyone. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning. David MacGregor : I guess I wanted to -- maybe a question for Aldo, but obviously, some huge incremental margins in both Snap-on Tools and in C&I. And you referenced the raw material benefit. So I mean we were expecting to report good margins, but these were certainly above what we were anticipating. How much of this price cost carries forward into 3Q and 4Q? Can you just talk about kind of the trajectory? Nicholas Pinchuk : I could let out. Okay. Aldo agreed. Okay, you can answer the question, Aldo. Go ahead. Aldo Pagliari : No. I think, David, I think most of the pricing actions a lot of incurred in the rearview mirror. So what you have now, as Nick has mentioned already, when you attenuate the incremental cost of spot buys have not gone completely, but they're greatly reduced. And steel different grades of steel at different prices, but particularly cold rolled steel, which is used in our tool storage products has come down, and we're able to hold on to the price that was set before and therefore, the benefit of material cost reductions accrue to the margin. So that's what you're seeing. And yes, I think that with a brand like Snap-on and the power of our approach to the market and the demand that Nick described that's out there, I expect that we'll be able to retain these types of margin performance as we move forward. Nothing's guaranteed, of course. Nicholas Pinchuk : I was watching a show last night and somebody said on the show, it was movie and said, electronic prices only go down, Snap-on prices only go up. We don't drop our -- I mean it's because you've got all the promotions and everything. It's hard to put your finger on it. But generally, I don't see us surrendering that too easily. David MacGregor : Can I just ask how much of that margin benefit that incremental margin was a result of the capacity constraints forcing the mix towards more customized tools because that sounds like that's fair -- new capacity. Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't know. It could be -- there could be some of that in there. Certainly, that -- the big factor, though, is there could be some of that. You're probably right. There's some of that. But the big factor, I think is the improvements in the face of the idea of no more spot buys, no more of those huge spot buys. So you're seeing that. Actually, we've been making improvements better than we have been showing for some time because of the material cost. And so what you see that is abating. So you're seeing a lot of that. So basically, I don't know where I put it on the foot of more customized product. We did sell a lot of customized products. So that works but we don't necessarily want to back off it. And so when you do have capacity constraints, you do tend to go to that. But on the other hand, when you got capacity constraint, you spend a little more money. You're looking at the SG&A and stuff like that, SG&A is up a little bit. And it takes you a little bit to manage through that. So you got some goes ins and goes out there. But there's a factor. But the big pack is RCI. David MacGregor : So let me just ask you about the organic growth of Snap-on tools because you report 1% organic growth. When you were talking about the Snap-on tool gross margin, you say both volume increases and price gains as drivers. So how do we reconcile the volume increases and price gains that you referenced in the gross margin story with the 1% organic growth and essentially flat in the U.S. Do we just take away from that, that the gross margins were essentially all cost reduction as opposed to revenue growth? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, look, I mean, some of this can be plant to plant and production line to production line, but I think you can say in aggregate, that's probably true. That's probably true. You don't get much wind in your sales from that kind of increase. It's not zero though, not zero increase. And so you get some of that. You have some international businesses that came back in this situation. So we had some things happen in that situation. but that's got to be the case right? You didn't get that much volume. David MacGregor : Yes. Last question for me because we're getting at the top of the hour here. But what's the trend in the total number of active stops across the Snap-on system in the U.S.? Nicholas Pinchuk : Active stocks, meaning what? David MacGregor : Stops. I mean a number of actual customer locations. I know you track that. So I'm just wondering what's the trend there in terms of the total number of stops? Nicholas Pinchuk : It's -- I don't have that number right here, but my feeling is it's moving upwards. But we don't really count the stops so much as we count the technicians and the technicians are growing. So we're getting more technicians. David MacGregor : Great, thanks very much. Thanks for taking the questions. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Operator : Our next question will come from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead with your question. Luke Junk : Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Nick, Aldo, good to talk. Nick, first question, I'm just wondering the capacity constraints you ran into the Tools Group this quarter, how that might play out in the near term versus the mix of business that you'd expect in the third quarter and what would typically be little bit of a seasonal decline sequentially. And if I listen to the cadence in terms of things coming online either end of this month or into the early part of the fourth quarter. It sounds like you think you'll be in a better position in the fourth quarter overall from a supply chain standpoint. Am I hearing that right now? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. We think that -- we think the fourth as I've said, probably on every one of these calls in the second quarter, that the third quarter is always kind of squarely because you've got the franchisee conference, then you got vacations, which if franchisees take long vacations that can affect it a little bit or they take short vacations also can affect it. So you have that in place what the Snap-on franchisee conference occurs. Now we might be seeing some little bit of anticipation for that as we did in the power tools. Certainly, power tools is not going to be affected by capacity. I don't think. So that's not going to be. Those new launches shouldn't be affected by capacity. And the capacity is coming online. And so we'll see how efficacious that is. We tend to be pretty good in putting these things in place. So I think you'd be right that the fourth quarter would be -- where we'd be hitting on more cylinders. Luke Junk : And then for my follow-up, just hoping you could comment on the trends that you saw in C&I. You mentioned Europe briefly and Asia, you highlighted the weakness that you saw in Japan hoping you could just expand on Europe more broadly in Asia-Pacific, excluding? Nicholas Pinchuk : Actually, the European business was up in RS&I and interestingly, the U.K. and the Tools Group came off of probably -- it was flat on its back last year, I think. So it came back some. But the C&I business was kind of a little bit up and down in Europe. And so you -- one of the things that was positive was critical industries. So the critical industry in C&I, boy, volumes and margins, new capacity in place smoke, but the other business is up and down, European hand tool based business in a number of different environments like the Nordics and so on, probably affected by concerns over the -- over the war and so on. That is a little bit up and down and not very robust. And I don't know where that's going to tell you. Your guess is as good as mine. I think we're well positioned, but I do think there are macros there that are hard to predict. In Asia-Pacific, boy, it's hard to find too many areas that aren't -- maybe India, I would say is doing well. But generally, a lot of areas seem to be having trouble creating a recovery from the COVID for a number of reasons. China, I think it's well documented. Everybody talks about China. We're holding our own in China. But Japan, the currencies make a little different. The Yen is pretty weak versus the U.S. dollar and has been for a while, and it's weakened recently versus the RMB. So products into Japan are not so competitive in some cases. So that weakens that. And the market itself is down somewhat. So you're seeing those kinds of things play out. I think Asia will start to work its way out because I don't think it has a long-term problem like the war or like some concerns over -- or where they're going to get their fuel or energy. So I think that fixes itself more quickly than Europe by in Europe, I'm not sure where it's going. Now the auto repair business in Europe in terms of the repair shop owners and managers is pretty good, particularly collision. The industrial business, pretty good, the critical industries business. But the basic up and down the street business and our tools business kind of. Luke Junk : Okay, I will leave it there. Thanks, Nick. Operator : And our next question will come from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead with your question. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning everyone. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning, Gary. Gary Prestopino : Nick, I know we've talked about this [indiscernible], but I'm really -- I'm a little bit confused here about what's going on in the Tools Group. Could you maybe just talk about the product segments where you had these capacity constraints? I think you mentioned tool storage, but what other products were you having or segments where you're having issues with capacity installers? Nicholas Pinchuk : Hand tools. Hand tools is at an all-time high. And some particular products are at over all-time high, like certain versions of the stock. And so when you got those stock, it sometimes your promotion is ready to go on a particular array of sockets as kind of a new package that will address a certain promise and you just don't have the capacity for, say, half of the package. And so that's open to us in a situation. So it's basically those guys bumping up against it and then over the top in tool storage, the industrial business starting to expand its capacity and being able to source more of other products from other people and so on, and break basically, the industrial business have been bound up in a kind of Gordian knot of shipments. I talked about it many times in the quarter. They cut that Gordian knot this quarter and started to ship more and that created more demand on the tool storage and hands tool plant as well. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then as we work through the year, you're bringing on capacity and this should alleviate as we work through that? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. I mean we've been saying this for a long time. It's just the particular ordering -- this ordering pattern in this quarter kind of bumped us up against it quicker than we thought. That's simply it. Gary Prestopino : Were the hand tools typical run-of-the-mill hand tools? Or were they more, like you said, customized? I'm just trying to understand how... Nicholas Pinchuk : No, they were not so much standard-standard. But there's a lot of lower run. I mean, by that I mean shorter production run hand tool in these kinds of mixes. And when you get into them, they eat up a lot of capacity. You see what I mean because you got to stop and start the machines and so on. So it's not a linear thing necessarily. If it was just standard-standard products, we probably could have shipped out of inventory if we needed to. But these other products make it difficult. But we saw it coming. It was just this particular one with the policy, the idea that people weren't buying as many power tools because they're waiting for the new stuff kind of shifted the mix towards these -- even more towards hand tools and power tools. I mean tool storage. Gary Prestopino : Okay. I just want to understand what's going on there. And then over time, as things have evolved here, could you maybe -- do you have any numbers or metrics you can circle around? What percentage of what you're doing in the tools or even across the whole company is going into collision repair versus mechanical repair? Nicholas Pinchuk : It's -- well, let's put it this way. I would say collision repair is about -- let me think about this. Equipment, the undercar equipment business is about one-third of RS&I, and I would say about maybe 20% to quarter of that is collision repair. That kind of ballpark and growing, though because equipment has been growing double-digits for some time. It was up double-digits again, and its margins were up nicely again. Gary Prestopino : Okay, thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly at snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day.

Please note today\u2019s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Sara Verbsky : Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review Snap-on's third quarter results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we've provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer, as well as on our website snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates, or beliefs or that otherwise discuss management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start by covering the highlights of the quarter, and then I'll provide an update on our general environment and the trends we see. Aldo will then give you a detailed review of the financials.  Speaking about the last three months, I can say without question or qualification, we are once again encouraged fortified by the progress along our runways both growth and improvement. We encountered headwinds and we engaged challenges in a number of geographies still we capitalized on our opportunities, wielding our advantage and overcame the potential for disruption.  The franchising network remain resilient generating positive gains through a broad and sharp rise in critical industries expanding what is now a consistent upward trajectory enabled by the confluence of our robust market of growing product lines and an effective expansion of capacity in that business. And that progress was pretty evident in our numbers.  They speak for themselves. Reported sales were $1,159 million, up 5.2% from last year, a 4.7% organic rise and $4.4 million in favorable foreign currency effects with growth in every segments. This represents our 13th quarter, well, above pre-pandemic levels. OpCo income, OI before financial services were up 9.7%, reaching $245.2 million, OpCo operating margin rose 90 basis points to 21.2% with higher sales volumes, the benefits of great new products and the ongoing efficiencies of a rapid continuous improvement or RS&I more than offsetting up 50 basis points, a bad news from unfavorable foreign currency effects, 21.2% and 90 basis points. Nice.  The operating income for our financial services operation grew $69.4 million from the $66.4 million last year, a 4.5% improvement and the result - and that result combined with the OpCo performance to raise our consolidated operating margins to 25.1%, a 70 basis point rise from 2022. And EPS, EPS was $4.51. reflecting a 37 or 8.9% increase above last year. Strong.  Well those are the numbers. Once again strong signifying our corporation\u2019s continuing advance. You see, we again believe that Snap-on is stronger now than at any time in our history and the results they say it so. Now let's review the markets. In vehicle repairs, key metrics continue to be favorable. The average age of vehicles on the road continuing to rise and in turn the number of techs in the garages, in the garage is growing high to high mid-single-digits maintaining consistently positive trends period-over-period, period-over-period. That's clearly upward.  Technician wages are robust and continuing to climb. So the market is favorable and the metrics back it up. But more than the quantitative evidence, you get the feeling of optimism potential when you speak with technicians.  Recently, I had a chance to visit with our customers\u2019 franchises and mechanics in New York. And I'm here to tell you the enthusiasm they displayed in the industry and the confidence they expressed in their future was something else. It was contagious. Even in this time of turbulence, the message was clear. They see opportunity and they're looking for more, more innovative solutions, that will increase productivity and take advantage of that potential.  And their confidence on the way forward is palpable. And we believe they see Snap-on products, brands and people as the best way to ensure that positive future. Vehicle repair is a strong market. We see this confirmed throughout the franchisee network in North America and in our international operations. It's one of the reasons we've expanded capacity.  We believe our franchisees and our technicians have never been more prosperous. It all makes sense. The car park is increasingly requires more repairs or greater complexity and our customers, the techs are major participants in that reality. They need - and they need new tools to follow the opportunity. Snap-on is positioned to take full advantage of that possibility.  Another important sector for us is the vehicle repair shop owners or managers. These are people who stand right next to the techs, but they buy at different cadences. This is where repairs systems and information group or S&I operates every day with advantage. The vehicle park is changing. The shops have to keep with the upswing model-by-model, new challenges, new challenges that they have to navigate.  Electronics to support more features. Automotive systems that enhance driver safety. New body materials to increase durability and reduce weight. Network of sensors to anticipate traffic and road conditions. No power trains. Enhanced internal combustion engines. EVs and plug-in hybrids and the conserved energy and on and on and on. Each of these, each of these trends creates opportunity for garages and they know it. But they also know it requires new more sophisticated equipment. The opportunity - that opportunity we see shines right through political uncertainty or economic turbulence.  We see, though that underneath every day when we call on the garages new software to guide repairs or manage the shop. Essential programs to accommodate either sequences of new vehicles, calibration protocols and advanced systems for sensor rays, advanced under car equipment to accommodate the precision - that the precision that supports efficient driving.  And we see the shop owners and managers are eager to take advantage of those trends Snap-on has the hardware and software to enable that pursuit bringing to shops and the results in our C&I are confirming the strength of that market and our strong position in it. Finally, let\u2019s discuss the critical industries. This is where we extend outside the garage solving tasks that that really matter. This is where commercial industrial or C&I lives. And where much more international activity happens. This is the arena of critical applications, space declarations, wind power maintenance, subsea mining, smelting that exceeds 2300 degrees Fahrenheit, the mobilization of first responders. All critical environments where the penalty for rearview was high and the need for repeatability and reliability often requires custom tools engineered for a single purpose. In other words, tasks that require a Snap-on solution.  Just like in previous quarters, the market is booming. Momentum in multiple sectors like the military, general industry, aerospace, heavy-duty and aviation. Of course, do just see variations from geography-to-geography, this is an international business. Areas impacted by external factors that create disruptions in Europe, with the uncertainty associated with the Ukraine war in Asia where the remnants of the pandemic are still pretty apparent; there's turbulence in China and the weakening of currencies these days are impacting particular countries.  But overall, the critical industries are robust offering us significant potential for taking advantage and making significant gains. And in the quarter, we did just that. So our markets are resilient and are on a positive trajectory and we believe that our runways for growth will present clear and abundant opportunities as we move forward enhancing the franchise network, expanding where repair shop owners and managers extending to those critical industries. And building and emerging markets. Rising - rising and going forward by leveraging our broadening product line, wielding our strengthening brand, and deploying the increasing understanding of the work that is the hallmark of the Snap-on team. That's the markets.  Now, let's turn to the segments. In the C&I group, third, quarter sales reached $266.4 million, up $9.6 million, which includes $1.6 million in unfavorable currency effects and an organic sales growth of 3.2% above last year. From an earnings perspective, C&I's operating income was $58.1 million, up 11.1% double-digits including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency. And the operating margin was 15.9%, an increase of 120 basis points overcoming 70 basis points of negative currency.  We did have some variation across the group - across the group business units with substantial gains in industrial vision offsetting declines in Asia operations. But as usual, the C&I rise showed the power of our Snap-on value creation, particularly on customer connection, innovation authoring great new products, solutions that make critical tasks easier, like our new CT9038 power tool.  We talked about this. We talked about this to a last quarter saying the franchisees were waiting for its launch. Well it was worth the wait. It's a special to0l. A three eight inch drive, 18 volt impact unit that, that, that offers compact housing measuring only five inches long. That's why we call it the stubby. The unique silhouette is made possible by engineering the overall housing mechanism to stabilize the electric motor rather than the standard approach of adding a whole independent structure to support the drive components. It's an innovation that reduces overall body dimensions allowing users to navigate really tight spaces and believe me, that's an attractive advantage for engine and suspension work on newer vehicles. And it does that while still delivering 520 foot pounds of bolt break away torque, power capable of busting with even the most stubborn of seized and seized fasteners. It's what you would expect from Snap-on.  It's an ergonomically balanced - it's ergonomically balanced, greatly reducing user fatigue. It's equipped with a super bright LED light to clearly illuminate the workplace. It also offers three torque settings and forward and reverse and includes a variable speed trigger enabling techs to apply just that necessary force avoiding the fastener damage that you know, often can happen in tight spaces.  The September launch was a big way oversubscribed. Clear testimony to the appreciation of the stubby\u2019s compact power and it's still showing great momentum. The orders remain very strong. It was worth wait. C&I product is encouraging. But there's another story in the group. Our industrial division, extending the Snap-on brands to the critical industries. We've said in the past that the opportunity was there. Always needed was more capabilities to deliver. Well it played out just that way. We did add capacity for kidding and it drove results. Expansion came to the fall of the last year. And this past period was the third straight quarter of clear double-digit growth in the critical industries.  And that was what's strong margins. Gangbusters, gangbusters margins, gangbusters growth. It overcame the C&I challenge in Eastern Europe and Asia. And we believe we have much more room to run in the critical - in the critical industry's arena. So we're adding more capability in that business right now to take full advantage.  Let's C&I substantial challenges overcome by strong products and expanded capacity to drive upward in the critical industries and there's more to come. Now on to the tools group. Sales line was up organically 3.7% over last year, reaching $515.4 million in the quarter. That's finished with great in a quarter, that finished with great momentum. And the Group's operating income continue to move strongly upward to $113.4, million, and 11% increase, double-digit increase over 2022 levels. Another in a series of those double-digit increases for the tools group and the operating margin was \u2013 it was 22% up 140 basis points from last year and that rise and \u2013 that considerable rise was achieved overcoming 50 basis points of unfavorable currencies, - a great quarter for the profitability and growth. Now, the third quarter is when we hold our annual Snap-on franchisee conference what call is the SFC. This year the event was a net show with 9,000 people attending, franchisees, guests and of course, Snap-on team all participating in the, in a weekend of special - in a great weekend. It was a weekend of special training. Hands-on encounters with our massive product line and for some fun - for some fun, special Snap-on celebrations, they're really good.  The attendees had the opportunity to spend time ordering directly from the tool exit expo floor. And I am happy to say orders were up again this year, which is and that exposed spanned a space of over three football fields where our entire portfolio of products was on display, but it had a wide array of demonstrations and that was specially designed to showcase the Snap-on performance advantage.  The conference also provided a number training sessions, helping franchisees expand their business. Seminars and special breakouts, highlighting our product features and unique advantages in critical categories like power tools and diagnostics and we topped off that multi-day event. This is, these are the celebrations with a - of coach buses transporting the teams to downtown Nashville for unique Snap-on\u2019s evening.  Boom, shakalaka was the word of the day with another memorable SFC and sightful, education, great, new products, and a special fellowship, a special fellowship that reinforces our unique bond with our franchisees. From my perspective, our van drivers at Nashville spoke enthusiastically about their current businesses and radiated firm confidence in their future with Snap-on. And if you were there, you would have seen it too.  During the tool expo, franchisees were able to spend time interacting with some of the new innovative products derived from our customer connections inside game, directly in the workplace handles were big at the SFC and in the quarter and the demand was driven by special new products like our 12 millimeter 6.6. meter Duramax glow plug socket.  This product was inspired by a franchisee observing the technicians removing blocking components one-by-one from a diesel vehicle, fender of special intake lines in steering shifts. These items create access barriers increasing the difficulty of executing the very basic repair of just changing diesel glow plugs, a routine test that that was made difficult because of our crowded engine compartment design with minimal regard for servicing.  We listened to the franchisee feedback, went to work designed - and new socket longer than the standard to reach the glow plugs from a distance. And with a flex mechanism that guide around the blockers, making - making it unnecessary to remove them. Technicians immediately recognize the considerable time savings that - it made the new sockets very popular.  It's another customer connection that transforms a laborious process, making more easier, freeing time and increasing tech capacity and therefore tech income. Also on display was another Display was another example of customer connection, the new FHC 72MPRR, these product terminations are mouthful. Triples but it's a we call it a triple function ratchet. Three tools in one. Again, born out of customer connection directly in the worst place. First the ratchet head can be secured parallel to the handle serving as an traditional ratchet. Next, the head can be adjusted to take any one of 16 available positions, 240 degrees around the handle centerline enabling the tool to work while reaching around obstacles. Finally, the unit can be placed in a free spin mode providing the tech with 360 degrees in continuous rotation, greatly reducing work time in low torque situations.  Our customers, the technicians again saw the great benefit of that improved productivity and that recognition made the triple function ratchet a million dollar hit product in just the first month of selling. It was another win for customer connection and a driver for the tools group. The tools group proves a third quarter achievement and momentum fueled by customer connection, innovative insight, anchoring great new products. And with the group\u2019s continuous dedication to Snap-on value creation, we believe the hits in the progress will just keep on comments. Turning to RS&I. Sales of $431.8 million in the third quarter were up as reported by 4.2% with an organic improvement of 3.1%, expansions in the undercar equipment and our diagnostics and information portfolio continued to offset the OEM businesses where - which finished down slightly in a traditionally lumpy arena.  OI for RS&I was $104.9 million, up 10%, again double-digits from 2022 and the operating margins was 24.3% represent - which represented an improvement of 130 basis points again against 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency. We've great confidence in our RSI business. Our customers and industries, partners feel the same, and that confidence was demonstrated in the latest public recognitions.  Recently Motor Magazine shows our Zeus Plus fast track intelligent diagnostic platform as a top tool in 2023. Our premium handheld unit was recognized for simplifying the repairs, guiding technicians through the troubleshooting procedures avoiding unnecessary steps along the way and improving solution, accuracy, and most importantly, reducing the time to identify the proper fit. The Zeus Plus is the top of the line for vehicle repair and the publications know it recognizing our handhelds for our handheld new prominent bright screen, increasing the ease of use in direct sunlight.  It's faster processor with more onboard memory enabling greater task efficiency, and it's improved lab scope making component testing much more accurate and when professional tools and equipment knows ask this readers to choose the best new tools as recipients of that publication's People's Choice awards the tech selected seven Snap-on products led the Zeus Plus. The Zeus Plus top of the line indeed. Hardware, software, shaped by customer connection, another and a long line of distinctive and decisive RS&I products driving the group upwards and onwards.  We're quite positive about RS&I\u2019s possibilities with repair shop owners and managers as the vehicle industry evolves and the quarter supports that confidence.  So those are the highlights of the quarter. Continued strong progress. The 13th straight quarter above pre-pandemic levels. C&I margins up year-over-year volume growth and strong, strong OI margins. The tools group, great products, confident franchisees and strong momentum. RS&I under car repair information activity leading the charge enabling the repair shops in the challenges in today's vehicles.  And the overall corporation sales up 5.2% as reported 4.7% organically. OpCo operating margin 21.2% up 90 basis points, overcoming 50 basis points of currency headwinds and an EPS to $4.51 rising 8.9% versus last year. It was an encouraging quarter.  Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,159.3 million of the quarter represented an increase of 5.2% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 4.7% organic sales gain and $4.4 million of favorable foreign currency translation.  Organic sales growth was balanced across all three of our operating segments and from a geographic perspective, we experienced year-over-year gains in North and South America, as well as Europe. Asia continue to be attenuated by weakness in China and Japan, the latter hampered by a depreciating Yen.  Consolidated growth margin improved 160 basis points to 49.9% from 48.3% last year as gross margins expanded across all of our operating segments. Contributions from increased sales volume with pricing actions, lower material and other costs and benefits to the companies RCI initiatives were partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales rose 70 basis points to 28.7% from 28% last year, primarily due to increased investment in personnel, and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $245.2 million in the quarter compared to $223.5 in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating larger before financial services of 21.2% including 50 basis points of unfavorable currency effects, reflects an expansion of 90 basis points over last year.  Financial services revenue of $94.9 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to $87.3 million last year, while operating earnings of $69.4 million compared to $66.4 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $314.6 million in the quarter, compared to $289.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.1% reflects an improvement of 70 basis points from 2022.  Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 22.6%, compared to 21.6% last year. Net earnings of $243.1 million dollars or $4.51 per diluted share, including an $0.08 per share impact from unfavorable foreign currency, reflected an increase of $19.2 million and $0.37 per share from 2022 levels, and represented an 8.9% year-over-year improvement in diluted earnings per share.  Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I Group on Slide 7. Sales of $366.4 million dollars increased from $356.8 million last year reflecting $11.2 million or 3.2% organic sales gain which was partially offset by $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth includes a double-digit gain in sales to customers and critical industries, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the segment to Asia Pacific operations.  With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. Overall C&I organic sales to external customers were up 7.1% for the quarter. Gross margin improved 210 basis points to 39% in the third quarter from 36.9% in 2022. This was largely due to increased sales volumes in the higher gross margin critical industry sector, pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives.  These improvements were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 90 basis points to 23.1% in the quarter, from 22.2% 2022, primarily due to increased sales and higher expense businesses and investments in personnel and other costs.  Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $58.1 billion, including $2.9 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $52.3 million last year. The operating margin of 15.9%, including 70 basis points of unfavorable currency effects, compared to 14.7% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 120 basis points. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on tools group of $515.4 million compared to $496.6 million a year ago, reflecting a 3.7% organic sales gain and $500,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales growth reflects a double-digit gain in our international operations and a low-single-digit increase in our US business.  Gross margin improved 140 basis points to 46.3% in the quarter from 44.9% last year. This increase is primarily due to higher sales volumes and pricing actions and benefits from RCI initiatives, partially offset by 50 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales was unchanged from last year with benefits from higher volumes offset by increased personnel and other costs.  Operating earnings for the Snap-on tools group of $113.4 million including $2.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to $102.2 million last year. The operating margin of 22% includes 50 basis points of unfavorable currency, compared to 20.6% in 2022 reflecting an improvement of 140 basis points.  Turning to the RS&I group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $431.8 million compared to $414 million in 2022 reflecting a 3.1% organic sales gain and $4.8 million of favorable, foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase includes a high-single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment and a low-single-digit increase in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers.  These gains were partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in activity with OEM dealerships where we often see variability in essential tool programs from period-to-period. Gross margin improved 260 basis points to 45.5% from 42.9% last year, mostly due to lower material and other costs and increase sales volumes and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales went up by 130 basis points to 21.2% from 19.9% last year, primary reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $104.9 million compared to $95.4 million last year. The operating margin improved 130 basis points to 24.3% from 23% reported last year.  Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7.6 million to $94.9 million from $87.3 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services, operating earnings of $69.4 million compared to $66.4 million in 2022. Financial Services expenses were up $4.6 million from 2022 levels, including $4 million of higher provision for credit losses. The year-over-year increase of provisions reflects both the growth of the portfolio, as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses decreased by about $500,000. For reference, our gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 9.3% year-over-year and we believe that delinquency in portfolio performance trends currently remains stable.  In both the third quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the third quarters of 2023 and 2022 average yields on contract receivables were 8.8% and 8.6% respectively. Total loan originations of $305.2 million in the third quarter represented an increase of $5 million or 1.7% from 2022 levels, including a 4% increase in originations of finance receivables.  Moving to Slide 11, our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.4 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.1 billion from our US operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.5% for US extended credit is the same as it was in this period last year. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 20 basis points reflecting the seasonal trend we typically experience in the third quarter.  As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $47.9 million represented 2.51% of outstandings at quarter end, which is up slightly from the 2.45% reported at the end of last quarter. Now, turning to Slide 12, cash provided by operating activities of $285.4 million in the quarter represented 115% of net earnings when compared to $129.9 million last year. The improvement as compared to the third quarter of 2022, largely reflects lower year-over-year increases of working investment, as well as higher net earnings.  Net cash used by investing activities of $59.7 million included net additions to finance receivables of $35.1 million and capital expenditures of $25.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $135.3 million included cash dividends of $85.6 million and the repurchase of 194,000 shares of common stock for $51.8 million under our existing share repurchase programs.  As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $304.5 million of common stock under our existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13, trade and other accounts receivable increased $15.1 million from 2023 events. Net sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 61 days as of 2022 year end. Inventory decreased $200,000 from 2022 year end. On a trailing 12 month basis, inventory turns to 2.4 compared to 2.5 at year end 2022. Our quarter end cash position of $959.3 million, compared to $757.2 million at year in 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 4.8% compared to 9% at year 2022.  In addition to cash, we expected cash flow from operations, we entered into a five year $900,000 multi-currency revolving credit facility on September 12, which amends and restates our previous $800 million facility. As at quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding.  That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. But briefly review a few outlook items for the remainder of 2023. We anticipate the capital expenditures will approximate $100 million. In addition we currently anticipate that our full year 2023 effective income tax rate will approximate 23%.  I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our third quarter. You know, I always say as the third quarter could be somewhat squirrely, not always indicative of trends. That's because of the SFC and the vacation seasons around the world. But having said that, the last three months haven\u2019t been encouraging. We took on some significant headwinds, the war in the Ukraine, and the uncertainly in China, both politically and economically.  We engaged those challenges came through at all with clear progress. New heights across the board. Continuing our - it all, continue our upward trajectory movement, the upward conjecture we've been on for some time. We spoken quite a bit about capacity constraints, first in the industrial business and later in the tools group, born of the increasing demand for our solutions.  And in this quarter, we clearly see the power of such expansions wielded by capable of experienced team enabled by decisive advantages, and products, and brands and applied in markets that are critical and resilient even amidst the challenges. The industrialization is performing as we said it would. Clear double-digit growth and strong profitability now, demonstrated for three straight quarters as its new capacity has come online.  And the tools groups starting to see the very early effects of that capacity propulsion closing out the quarter with great momentum and with significant rises in overall profitability. At RS&I, not capacity bound, but establishing a strong and profitable position in the repair shops with software strength like our Mitchell 1 systems, diagnostic ascendance like our decorated Zeus Core to Intel and by clear answers to challenges of repair complexity up and down the under car equipment line, continuing the steep upward trend in that broad product arena.  This was an encouraging quarter. You can see it in the results. C&I sales up 3.2% organically, external sales, particularly robust. Significant gains in critical industry overcoming the uncertainty of Europe and Asia. OI margin of 15.9% up 120 basis points against 70. Again, 70 basis points of unfavorable currency. The tools group sales was up organically 3.7% close to target exiting the quarter with momentum as the expansion start to help and an OI margin of 22%, up 140 basis points. Again overcoming 50 basis points of currency headwinds.  In RS&I, sales rising 3.1%, OI rising 10% and the OI margins reaching 24.3%, an uplift of 130 points. And all drove the corporation higher. Sales were up 4.7% organically. Overall OpCo operating margins were 21.2%, a gain of 90 basis points, 90 basis points against 50 basis points a bad currency and all of that drove an EPS of $4.51, up versus every comparison. And we believe that with our decisive and widening advantages in product, the Snap-on value creation process, customer connection and innovation, people keep - will keep rolling out powerful new products day after day. Our advantages in brands Snap-on remains the outward sign of pride and dignity that working men and women take in their profession.  Everybody knows it's true and advantages in people. Our battle tested and capable team people that expect to rise even against difficulties. With those advantages amplified by capacity investments and applied to resilience and critical markets we believe that our enterprise will rise on a clear and continuing positive trajectory through the remainder of the year on into 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. My friends, this was an encouraging quarter. It was hard one against significant turbulence and it was driven by your constant dedication and effort. For the success in our third quarter delivered by your hands, you have my congratulations.  For the extraordinary capability you bring to bear every day and every situation, you have my admiration. And for the unwavering confidence you consistently express and clearly demonstrate in the future of our enterprise and our team, you have my thanks.  Now I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Brad Jordan at Jeffries. Please go ahead. Patrick Buckley : Hey, good morning guys. This is Patrick Buckley on for Brad. Thanks for taking our questions. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Patrick Buckley : Last quarter, you guys called out the demand exceeding capacity in a few tools product lines. Did you see that mix mismatch balance out this quarter? Or has some of the trends persisted there? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yeah. Well, like, I think I \u2013 what I was trying to say in my remark is that it got better through the quarter. We started to get some of the value with the capacity expansions. We\u2019re starting to get the early effects of those things. So you saw some of that start to balance out, but it's still there. We expected to continue to - but those capacity expansions to continue helping us going forward. But it's kind of the same thing. When we have these capacity constraints and they were principally in hand tools and in the tools group, there were at hand tools and in and tool storage as the quarter, we see them ease a little bit, but they're not where we want them to be. They're going to be, yes. Patrick Buckley : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, within your OEM dealership customer base, you guys will \u2013in that RS&I business you called out some weakness and lumpiness. Is overall demand pretty healthy there or what exactly is the driver? Nicholas Pinchuk : Demand is pretty healthy on a relative basis. I mean, the thing is what these businesses what this business referred to is, these are projects, programs authored or commissioned by OEMs principally to deal with the idiosyncrasies of a changing environment or with a new vehicle. Maybe it needs a new trailer hitch adjustment because something wasn't anticipated or a different tool to take out the wiring harness or maybe to support vehicle charging stations that dealerships once because electric vehicles are coming on or maybe for a special. And what it is, is the OEM ask us to configure the product and then distribute it to its dealerships. And, that\u2019s been going upwards. But it is lumpy, it's big project, that's a big project that's good product. So if you get, x number of men in one quarter and you get x minus one in another quarter is a little bit of pressure on that. In this situation, the, the EQS business was down somewhat. Well, I think low-single-digits or something like that, but it was really last year it has risen tremendously associated with the fuselage of new models that are rolling out into the markets. And so this is down somewhat versus a pretty strong position. So it just reflects kind of some lumpiness along the surface for that business and that\u2019s created some offset to C&I. For RS&I. Patrick Buckley : Got it. That's helpful. That's all for us. Thanks guys. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Hey, good morning everyone. Nicholas Pinchuk : Good morning, Gary. Gary Prestopino : Nick, can you - you said that the orders coming out of the conference were strong. I mean, could you give us some idea of some metrics to surround that? I mean, was it one of \u2026 Nicholas Pinchuk : Yeah, sure. They were up mid-single-digits. So, this is a nice we like this kind of thing because it shows we're going to keep growing in that sort of range we expect to grow. It's been upward during the pandemic, it have been up more higher at some points. But generally mid-single-digit growth is pretty good for us. We were kind of very encouraged by that idea. You know, you got to remember though Gary, as you know very well, these things are just orange. You know, they are orders. They are not necessarily sales and those orders are spread out over six months or seven months.  So it's hard to correlate them to anything in particular, but having said that, having orders up mid-single-digits is better than a poking an eye with a sharp stick. You know, it's okay. We kind of like that. Gary Prestopino : Right. Okay. And then, just a question just in terms of, as we go forward as the car park gets older, but you're starting to get more of a proliferation of older cars with technology where does your emphasis go at that point? Does it more of a shift from hand tools to increased diagnostics? Specialized diagnostics for these cars? Or is that just or maybe you can give us some guidance there? Nicholas Pinchuk : The thing is, is that you would think that would be logical. I would. Yeah, for sure, it bodes greater emphasis on electronics and software and other highly - high tech things like calibrations and things like that, which are the words of the day, then they are now, and then you are going to see a continuing upswing of that investment and the capability and value and revenue and profit generated by that stream.  But I'm not so sure that hand tools will be attenuated, because as we look backwards, you know we remember this industry in the 90s where the number of trouble codes, electronic trouble codes on a car were measured in dozens. Now they're measured in tens of thousands and the demand for handle tools is only going up.  So I would, I'm not so sure that hand tools will be lessened. I believe that software and electronics and diagnostics and calibration will be increased. That's what I would say. Now, by the way, the hand tools are pretty good margin. But it\u2019s hard to predict those, because like I try to explain and explain since I was putting out with the diesel plug, gold plug sockets and the triple flex function in ratchet.  Really these are things that are observed after the cars on road and you see the struggles that the technicians are having and you would enable them. And so I would anticipate they will continue to be in demand as we go forward. We haven't seen any abatement of that demand even as we've seen a growth in the electronics and calibration business. Gary Prestopino : Okay. And then, just a question for Aldo, just on the tax rate, Aldo, I think you have kind of said and have the numbers in front of me, but your tax rate for this year would be between 23% and 24% on previous calls. Now you\u2019ve stepped it down to 23%. But to get to that kind of a tax rate for the year, you're going to have to be somewhere over 24% for Q4. Am I reading that, right? Aldo Pagliari : That will be the neighborhood actually of - I think our rate year-to-date it\u2019s put them all together is around 22.9% or something like that. So we are in the ballpark area. So I think it'll be in that neighborhood in Q4 We've had some favorable outcomes on reducing our state taxes along with some other items. But that's what benefited Q3. In order to Q3 last year it was even better. So sometimes there's variation that occurs from time to time. But 23% is about the right number I think we're going to get to this upcoming full year. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Nicholas Pinchuk : Actually you are looking over a year we had you know kind of a - what 6,7,5,6 cents impact for taxes year over year each quarter. Negative impact. Yeah, so we still were up 8.9% even with the $0.37 even when that $0.06 impact. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from David McGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David McGregor : Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Nicholas Pinchuk : Hi, David. David McGregor : Hey, Nick. I just wanted to ask you about the UAW strikes and any potential impact or re precautionary decision across the business. You talked already about the dealership business and you characterized as being lumpy, but I'm wondering just maybe OEMs told you to hit the brakes on that. Well, they are sorting the strike issues and then there was any followed on the tool segment as well? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yeah, that's a complicated. Look, it's hard to predict, of course, this is like shooting darts in the dark or something. But, look, I think I think this is the situation. First of all, I want to correct just a little bit. The dealership business itself was not down. The OEM programs were down some, but they were still at a relatively historically high levels even though they backed off a little bit, year-over-year. So we haven't seen what I would call a significant pullback in the OEM programs at this point. Having said that, the OES, the UAW strike, I used to work for the auto companies themselves, and they are cash monsters, you know, they eat cash like mad and so it could happen as the strike goes on longer, you could see some diminishment in that business, in that particular business.  Now, when that would hit, I'm not so sure because, they might not cancel programs. They must just delay some or they may they may in fact cancel future programs. Not so clear how they would play out. But it is a possibility that that would happen. Regarding the dealerships themselves, I don't necessarily \u2013 I think the effect on them is unknowable because sometimes if they don't get new cars, they just turn more attention to repair and parts.  And so this is good news for us. Sometimes they pull in the back down the hatches and reduce. But generally I think they tend to look at more at repair and parts if they don't get the new cars and that's not so bad. So I see that as being the two possibilities playing out. David McGregor : Right. Okay, thanks for that. And then, just back to your earlier observation with the SFC order book was up 5% to mid-single-digit. Nicholas Pinchuk : I think it\u2019s 5, to kind of mid-single. David McGregor : No you said mid-single. Nicholas Pinchuk : Right. David McGregor : Right. Single-digit minus \u2013 I apologize. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. David McGregor : I'm just trying to sort of reconcile that with some of the capacity challenges you're facing which are clearly improving, but it sound like they'll still be somewhat of an issue in 4Q. Do you see more of the fulfillment on that order growth being channeled into sort of 4Q and maybe on a year over basis than what you would seen a year ago when there wasn't that kind of an impediment in place? And there was a consequent you might see a little bit of incremental growth from that concentration in 4Q? Nicholas Pinchuk : I guess. I don't know, I think I'm not quite sure I understood exactly the import of your question, David. But, but the thing is, the way I see it is, the capacity is getting better. Even if you have the building up, you can start putting in the machines there's a ramp up period. You don't have this worse and so you kind of get this, it starts to help you. The first the first product that comes out is the help but it's not so clear how much of a help will be.  I think, you'll still see us in a fourth quarter trying to stick handle around the capacity issues and that's part of the thing that's here. But that's stick handling will get more \u2013 less complex and therefore we should be able to take more advantage of the orders. But the timelines, the time constants associated with that are always pretty hard to predict, the dependent on your ability to wrap up, which we have a lot of faith in and it is dependent on the nature of the orders applied against those.  I would simply say that looking forward we feel like we're in a better position than looking recently backwards. David McGregor : And then - maybe this is a questions for Aldo, but are you able to talk about just, the impact on margins from the capacity constraints and incremental costs associated with that in 3Q? Aldo Pagliari : No, the overall margin performance is pretty solid as you saw across the board. Sure, there are incremental cost and expediting expenses and elements of over time of overtime having to be expended. But at the same time, we with the supply chain improvements that have occurred over the past 12 months or so, we have more resources to turn our attention to RCI initiatives. So, David, well, there is a lot of challenge in any quarter we expect to rise the occasion and try to offset those incremental costs.  But yes, there will be some incremental cost involved, but the tools group and the other segments are able to offset that. Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't know I had a chime in here though. In my book, I think over a hundred basis points margin improvement in every segment - I don't know, sounds gangbusters to me. Not so. And so, it sounds pretty good to me. So I think - I think it should be helped going forward, but I'm not sure where that will lay out. We anticipate like, I say we expect to improve margins all the time. David McGregor : Great. Thanks gentlemen. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Christopher Glenn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glenn : Hey, thanks. Good morning all. Curious Nick if you could elaborate on your comments about expand adding capabilities in the critical industry space, what types of activities? What's the scale? What exactly are you chasing so to speak? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, look I think this a first of all, I would say that we haven't plumbed the complete ceiling of the first capacity expansion. By the way, just as a commercial, if you want to, if you want to behold the capacity expansion, you could look at it and I think the back page of our annual report this year. So, it's right there. Pretty, pretty sizable thing. And so we're still figuring out how to wheel that. That's how it works. You start out and it's pretty good and then you do better, better and better. So I think we have some, some ways to go there. What I'm talking about adding is, we just added a new machine shop, just for the critical industries in that space. And so that's a particular product where we used to have to outsource them. They took longer to do and we weren't as effective in getting them out. And so we decided to do it ourselves in-house. And so we see that will match up one, we can we can be more efficient in sourcing, which is a big factor for us and two, we can be more creative and actually matching the direct demands that customers want. So that's what I meant. Christopher Glenn : Great. And then, cash is approaching $1 billion. Now, not sure what level you are comfortable holding but that will kind of keep piling up unless you accelerate some sort of deployment. So I am wondering how you are thinking about that cash balance? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, look, I think, I think this, first of all, we are very working capital intense. So, as we move upwards, you tend to use some of that cash for working capital. Although, we're in an era where we were, we used working capital to cushion ourselves against the difficulties of the pandemic. So, some of that go way out. We look hard at our dividends, which we have paid every quarter since 1939.  And I love to say at this point have never reduced it any quarter since 1939. And so, perpetuity is our guiding line on dividend. So we'll look at that again, we\u2019ll look at that. And then, you have things like pension and you have, you have things like acquisitions, which are important to us. So, we have a landscape of acquisitions, which will constantly look at.  Like, I always say, some are big, some are small and we're not afraid to make a big one. So I kind of like having a war chest for that, especially in these tides when the when the interest rates are pretty high. And then finally we look at buying back opportunistically shares. Christopher Glenn : Yeah, following up on the pipeline, are you seeing any changes in availability actionability of some of the larger prospects? Nicholas Pinchuk : I'm not seeing any. I guess we see a little bit more availability. I'm not sure actionability is any better or not. I think there's been a lot of discussion of that. I think bankers \u2013 every bank that you see wants to talk about that. But I don't see much difference in that regard. You would think prices would be coming down with the maybe with interest rates rising. I don't know but - I don't see that. We see a little more availability, though. Little more availability. Christopher Glenn : Okay, great. Sorry last point for me. I think you said technician concept meant to high-single-digits. I imagine there's some lag effect to seeing that benefit. Is that fair to think about that as a lead indicator and driver during that \u201824? Nicholas Pinchuk : I think that is fair to look, I think, especially sense there's an accelerator there, Christian. I've been in a shop I am ten1years. And for most of the years technicians were growing at 1%, 1.1%, that was just this. It was really like, a metronome. 1.1%, 1.1% , 1.1% And now it's growing mid single digits. And so, this has got to come in and accelerate for us because one, they'll be more technicians and two, the new guys need to tool up.  Now, of course that tool up takes on different shapes. So, for example, they may not be buying the top of line boxes right away. They may be focused on cards, which in fact if you looked at our tool storage business in the past quarter, it was heavily guided to cards. And so, we're seeing some of that effect right now.  What they do need to tool up and one of the great things about it is, we spent, I think we're like thousands of schools around the country trying to make sure that people understand that the Snap-on brand is the most powerful brand that repair making students Snap-on customers for life. And I think we see that as they come out into the marketplace. So growing Texas music to warriors. Christopher Glenn : Thanks for all the color. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Scott Stember with Roth MKM. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Nicholas Pinchuk : Hey Scott. Scott Stember : Hey. Within the tools, could you just tell us how some of the sub segments did, hand tools versus tool storage versus diagnostics in power tools? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yeah. Look, I think the big the big cohonent this month was hand tools, just not last quarter, it was hand tools sold very well in the quarter. And so that, that was pretty strong. Diagnostics was off certainly after three good quarters and they didn't have a new installation here. And power tools was down somewhat because the stubby wasn't launched for sale until after the SFC. So that was really a back-end phenomena given part of the great momentum in that situation. If you look at the back end, you would see power tools being a big factor in that situation because it's sold like wildfire. Like I said, the wait was worth it but we demonstrated at SFC people were crowding around it, but we weren't selling it.  We just wanted to create more pent-up demand in that situation. Tool storage was down somewhat, but that was pretty much a substitution of as I just said, of got the carts which are lower, lower value per unit than the bigger units. And they take up a little more, a little more manufacturing space. So that, that kind of thing is what was in was in tool storage. Units were pretty good, but revenues were a little lower because of the mix. Scott Stember : Got it. And as far as the sales after van versus into the van. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sales off the van probably follows the, you can say they pretty much follow the tools group, in terms of the numbers you saw in the tools group in general overall and the rise at the end of the quarter. I think one of the things this time, I think we saw a lot of vacations in some cases, like we always do that's why I say these quarters were squirrely. Scott Stember : At the sell-in \u2013 sell-through was was essentially the same as sell-in. Nicholas Pinchuk : Must be the same. Yes. Scott Stember : Okay. Got it. And then just last housekeeping question I saw the corporate expense up five plus million. What was that related to? Nicholas Pinchuk : Pretty much stock-based compensation was a lot of it and part of that is, okay, I think we're doing a little better this year than last year and just a basic year. But also, after you put several years together of good if you go back and look at our numbers, they're up, up, up, up. You know, you are talking about quite a bit of getting - point OI margins to start, it starts to work its way into the long term incent this as well. So, you're starting to see some of that play out in that situation. There are other things drifts and drafts here, but that I think for government work, that's it. Scott Stember : Got it. That's all I have. Thank you. Nicholas Pinchuk : Okay. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead. Luke Junk : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple of margin related questions for me at the segment level. First one Nick, just if I look backwards in the tools group, there's just been a lot going on there in terms of material inflation, supply chain, product, mix that's been variable and it seems like those are things that could settle down into next year.  And I guess I said that against what's already been a step function change in profitability in the tools group. Do you see any key offsets or risks that we should be thinking about going into next year maybe normalizing price increases versus just building off of where the tools business is now and sort of a normal margin progression into 2024? Nicholas Pinchuk : No. I don't - I look, I think this time material wasn't a major factor. Tools group is sort of over that, you know. And so I don't think you're going to see that. I think the tools group is just on a good - what, what you eat. But by the way, all the - lot of the things you mentioned, like product mix and all that that wasn't on it. It's all every quarter there. Here's been like this, every quarter is like that.  They're always a mix of things that happen in the tools group. So we just simply try to balance them so they drive things upwards. This quarter, we got a nice dollop of good margin business. The hand tool business is pretty good. And by the way, when you take a customer connection and you solve somebody's problems, that's why I try to talk about those two things.  When you get the glow plugs out in a substantially shorter time, people want that and you get your margins for it. It might seem arcane, but that's the kind of stuff that gets you money. When you provide them a triple flex ratchet, where they can use three different things that are having problems getting around them, they will pay it for it.  And that kind of stuff works for us. So most - I think one of the things that's been driving our margins in this period and all the periods has been a relatively robust product activity. Now, one of the things that did happen, I think fairly is during the pandemic when supply change started to be a problem, we were focusing on our engineers on substitution somewhat and took away new product capacity, because the engineers, we only have so many engineers, some of them are working on trying to find components that you can actually source, so you can deliver.  But now that that's all over, we can turn the engineers on new product again. So the machine starts rolling at full speed. So we feel pretty good about this actually going forward. Luke Junk : Thanks. And then just a follow up on RS&I, just thinking about mix in that business. So maybe I'm reading into this too much in which case, tell me if I am, the under car equipment, that's been growing strong double-digits for going, three years now just slightly lower growth up high-single-digits this quarter. I'm just thinking of sort of the mix of growth here between the software businesses in under car equipment and to what extent we might see more of that software mix shine through going forward. Thanks. Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, I don't know. I mean, I think we'd like to see the software mix go up. I mean I think you're going to see that software is up nicely. I mean Mitchell 1 had a better, nice quarter. Mitchell 1 had a great quarter, people or the repair shop owners or managers, or whatever they and we see that building there. So we think we got that on with some great new adjustments and we got more coming.  You got the diagnostics business, which will which will I think as we move forward new offerings will drive that business. And - but undercar equipment is lower - is lower profitability, but in the context of relativism they are I don't know, I believe at all-time high in profitability for them. So when you compare year-over-year, you're getting a positive margin contribution from those guys.  So what we have here, I mean, I think the way forward is somewhat what you're talking about, the way forward for RS&I is more software, but also we believe we can raise the margins in things like the equipment business. Because we have been doing it and they're at an all-time high now and going upwards. So we see those to be the two, I guess factors in that situation.  So that's where I see. So I think pretty good things. But look, RS&I with good sales and equipment with good strong sales and equipment that what were they, 24.3% up 130 basis points, that's not shop liver. So they seem to be able to keep improving, go back and look at the results. They keep going upwards. I think that'll continue. Luke Junk : Okay. Yeah, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks for that comment on the equipment margins. That's helpful, Nick. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : Thank you and ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on Snap-on.com. As always we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our quarter and our full year, and I'll provide my perspective on the results, on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will then give you a detailed review of the financials. The results for our fourth quarter represented that we believe, another period of forward progress. Again, we had opportunities and countered headwinds and the shape of the variated landscape changed as it regularly does. But in the end, we once again took advantage of the opportunities and overcame the turbulence. Sales in the quarter were $1,196,600 million or $1.2 billion, sounds better that way, up 3.5% as reported from last year, excluding $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency and $5.5 million from the recent Mount acquisition. Organic sales increased 2.2%. The results represent a positive trend of some significance, demonstrating Snap-on's ability to adapt and to overcome market disruptions. From an earnings perspective, our OpCo operating income for the quarter was $257.9 million, and the OI margin for the quarter was $21.6 million up 10 basis points compared to last year. For Financial Services, operating earnings were $67.9 million, rising from the $63.9 million recorded last year. And the combination of the results from OpCo and from Financial Services offered an overall consolidated margin of 25.2%, also up 10 basis points. And the overall EPS was $4.75, a rise of 7.5% from the $4.42 that was registered a year ago. Now I talked about margins, let's turn to those markets and the trends we're seeing, based on our customer connections. We're with customers all the time. We believe automotive repair continues to be clearly favorable. Vehicle OEMs continue to see the need for upgrading dealer repair shops and enabling the shops and servicing the blizzard of new miles and technologies making the way to the market. And preparing for that future, OEM continue, requiring dealership investments in new Under Car Equipment and essential tools to meet the challenge. It's a considerable opportunity at which Snap-on is clearly taking advantage. Activity in the independent shops is also robust. You can see it in the vehicle and repair macros, car parks. The car park is growing and getting older. Now over 12 years old on here, cars are getting more complex and more difficult to fix and reflecting all of that, service hours are up. Household spending on repair is growing. Wages are rising. The number of technicians is moving upward fast and ship-owners keep shouting, they want more technicians, even louder than they have over the past years. So the underlying repair business is strong. It's prospering. It was a reality that kept the text positive, even as the financial was champing over the past years and months, the recession is coming, the recession is coming. But cash isn't everything. Cash is in everything for the people of work. Personal confidence is a balance between your current environment, the garage we see and the way you see the world evolving in sometime and sometime in the mid fall of last year, our franchisees sense that balance shifting negatively. In recent weeks, I've been around, I visited franchisees all over the country; in Nevada, South Carolina and Wisconsin, and they all said about the same thing. The techs are cash rich, but because of the external bad news of getting for breakfast almost every day, the impact in the Ukraine, the war in the Middle East, the dysfunction at the border and the uncertainty of the upcoming election, the weight of it all appears to be turning the tech's, confidence poor. And when this happens, based on what we've seen in other times, we've seen it happen before, our customers keep purchasing, but they gravitate towards shorter payback items. And so it appeared to be as the quarter progressed. You saw that from mid to the end of the quarter. And so repair is strong, but the techs are worrying about the way forward, still cash rich, but they appear to be wavering in their confidence. This is a big change. Now let's move forward to critical industries. That's, of course, a bit different color. Confidence seems to be abundance across that business. This is where our commercial and industrial group or C&I, plays. We continue to see progress. And again, the results in the quarter reflect that trend. It's a complex segment. A lot of you know this already, but I'm going to say the context, it's a complex segment embedded with essential techs where the penalty for failure is high. It's an arena that demands precision, functionality and repeatability, all under the most grueling environments, covering a vast range of applications from the sensitive micro world of chip manufacturing to giant rugged earthmoving equipment to performance critical aviation, things even up to spaceships. The underlying need for customization - but in that segment, the underlying need for customization and precision both, Snap-on strength is clearly growing all across those sectors. C&I, is also the most geographically dispersed operations. And there's, significant variations from country-to-country and created by the uncertainties in the economic political policies. As such, we see mixed results in Europe and a continuing but slow recovery in Asia. We also see differences from sector-to-sector with education, aviation and the military, military and general industries, all showing nice improvements where natural resources and heavy-duty are off. But shining through all that variability is our expanding strength in those critical industries. The advantage Snap-on holds in product and brand and in people. And in the quarter, those drivers were on display. So across our corporation, I would characterize our markets as mixed, turbulent from period-to-period and from sector-to-sector, but filled with ongoing opportunity. And we believe we're well positioned to face the challenges of today, though at the end of today and those that may arise in the future. We remain confident that we have the continuing potential along - we have continuing potential long-run run rates for growth, and we see significant power to overcome rooted in our Snap-on value creation processes of safety, quality, customer action innovation and rapid continuous improvement, especially customer connection. One of our substantial competitive advantages is being right where the actual paths are being pursued and in engineering the products to make the work easier by matching those insights, the insights gained with technology applied. We've seen that over time, we've seen that innovative offerings create the path to advance and to overcome any turbulence. And in the quarter and in the year, our product line continued to advance, just kept getting stronger. And we continue to invest in Snap-on value creation to make that possible. We believe, in fact, that our product line has never been stronger. And despite the turbulence, we had more million dollar hit products in 2023 than ever before, and we believe we'll move higher again in 2023 than ever before, and we believe we'll move higher again in 2024. Now, let's talk about the full year, the 2023 performance. Sales of $4.7302 billion represented an increase of 5.3% as reported and arrived at 5.6% organically. Opco alone exceeded $1 billion. I'd say that again, $1 billion for the first time, reaching $1.399 billion and our Opco on margin of 22%, 22% represented an average increase, an increase of 110 basis points at gangbusters. We've never been at 22 and 110 is a great increase. And when we include financial services earnings of $270.5 million, the consolidated operating margin for the corporation year was 25.7%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share with the year were $18.76, rising $1.94 or 11.5%. We believe these are good numbers. Now for an individual - for the individual operation. Now for the individual operating group. So let's start with C&I. Reported sales for the C&I group in the quarter were $363.9 million, up $20.7 million or 6%. That includes $5.5 million from the recent Mountz acquisition, $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency and our organic sales increase of $11.6 million or 3.3%. They all reflecting the strength in critical industries, partially offset by a slide in automotive power tools. C&I's operating income for the period was $54.1 million. It was up 12.9% and the OI margin was 14.9%, rising 90 basis points and overcoming 50 basis points of headwind associated with negative currency. Again in this case, the advance was driven by strong expansion in critical industries. And our increased kitting capacity for complex orders continue to play a large role in that progress, but significant advances also spur as a regular is by new product. Innovations like our recently launched automated tool control or ATC portal, it's the latest addition to our unique Snap-On ATC tool control product lineup. It's manufactured at our AutoCrib operation that was recently acquired in California, and the portal significantly extends the reach of our ATC systems. It enables efficient control over a much wider range of device shapes and sizes. In effect, this portal's a doorway, in line with radio frequency identification or RFID antenna, it's typically a place that enters to tool. Significant assets like hydraulic pumps, portable generators and valuable diagnostic equipment are often stored in common areas in factories or other places and enter a catalog by fixing an RFID tag. As technicians scan the badge is entering with the portal, the system documents the devices will be in and out of the secured stores, keeping close track of these critical items, just like the base ATC system keeps track of hand and power tools moving in and out of the tool storage box, but over a much wider set of areas. We anticipate that the new portal will be a big boost and a great opportunity for C&I in the growing area of tool control, a very important area for us. And in the fourth quarter, we saw some of that potential come to bear. So C&I, mixed progress, challenged with headwinds but clear and overall advancement, great momentum enabled by capacity expansion and by growing product power. Now to the Tools Group. The Tools Group quarter, not at our standard. But we do see a path forward adjusting to the changing environment. As you may remember, this is where we sell to the text. Those who toil the wrenches, punch the touchscreen and those who appear to be wavering in macro confidence and those customers who under these conditions shift to lower payback or quicker payback items. While the fourth quarter reflects our franchisees and the Tools Group pivoting to match that movement, that customer movement. Sales in the quarter were $513.3 million included in our - and they included an organic decrease of 5.7% compared to last year. Now more to our standard, group OI margins were 21.6%, up 20 basis points, overcoming 10 basis points of negative currency and the gross margin percentage rose 200 basis points, nice gains. As the quarter played out, the franchisee sense the change and redirected their ordering and selling focus to match the customer shifts to lower - to faster payback items. And Snap-On is doing the same, defining a way forward, redirecting factory capacity, adopting smaller ticket marketing focus and launching innovative or quicker payback products that fit the environment. State-of-the-art designs, like our new ratchet for a manufacturer to Elizabeth, Tennessee factory. This next evolution in our ratchet line is 102 design, we've named the Synergy series. We believe it's a game changer for technicians, a significant improvement that helps make repair work much easier. The Synergy is a short payback item that will make a clear difference right away, a 15% thinner head, an inch longer handle a 3.5-inch degree swing area, 20% more compact, all for easier access and quicker work in tight corners that they also come up like chassis areas in modern vehicles. Synergy's internal mechanisms were reengineered to engage the primary drag with 10 contact points versus the seventh in the previous design, greatly reducing the chance of slippage, improving the tools reliability and quality even while under maximum loads. Technicians may be uncertain about the way forward, but they're confident about the synergies. They know with the Synergy. They know it will provide a quick payback. It's thinner, longer, stronger. And going forward, we'll expand that new technology - the new 102 technology throughout the Snap-on lineup, and we believe it will quickly become a must-have all across the industry. Also in the quarter, our Algona, Iowa manufacturing facility to reach the new quick payback, KRSC2430, a 36-inch deluxe shop cart with its with smooth mobility and a substantial payload. It offers a technician economic an attractive way to start the tools but it also allows them to position their instruments adjacent to the workplace, increasing productivity, eliminating the time walking to and from the job. As a particularly special feature, the versal lid on this cart serves as a durable workbench when open separates into 2 sections, showing full and easy - allowing full and easy access to the deep 8-inch top compartment that's underneath. The unit also includes a complete power strip where technicians charge their cordless tools, diagnostic platforms, lights and other electronic devices. The innovative cards also configured with two additional jaws. There's kind of two additional drawers underneath the sliding top, providing quick accessibility for essential and small items preventing lost times from treasure hunting and large drawers or small-scale items. And it's a common problem with other units. And so this will really save time for the text. And like our top-of-the-line tool storage boxes, technicians can customize their cart, selecting from an array of colors and trims and so they can project their own personal identity throughout the shop. The KRSC2430 economical storage, attractive features convenient mobility, we expect it will have strong and continuing to appeal in this uncertain environment. And shifting the product focus also requires some repositioning in the factory. Expanding the capacity to match customer preference, we're doing just that, moving to currently popular items, more dedication to short payback to products like our plexin swivel sockets and the new long nose pliers in Milwaukee, additional cart welding, breaking bottlenecks for our economical storage cart options in Algona and doubling down on synergy production in Elizabeth, Tennessee. Finally, our sales teams are being deployed to help franchisees, giving them added energy and more time in selling shorter payback items off their truck. Well, that's the Tools Group. Shifting tech preferences, pivoting operations to ensure the way forward, adapting products, capacity and sales focus, making the most of our strengths in the turbulence. Now for RS&I. The group results confirmed what we've been saying all along, Snap-on is well positioned to support repair shops, dealers and independents and keeping pace with the growing complexity of the car park. RS&I sales in the quarter were $450.8 million, up $12.9 million versus last year, including an organic sales rise of $8.8 million that was authored by volume with vehicle OEM programs for new models and platforms and by strong progress in undercar for both dealerships and independent shops, gains that served to offset the decrease in the big-ticket diagnostic items. RS&I operating earnings for the quarter were $113.3 million, and the operating margin was a still strong 25.1%, but down 20 basis points, reflecting the mix shift to lower-margin under car and OEM facing and the OEM-facing activities. But just like other segments, RS&I advances are driven by new products. And even the aging car park is filled with diverse and ever-changing models. Light-duty trucks and full-size SUVs are bigger than ever requiring a range of wheel configurations and sizes somewhere over 100 pounds. And at the recent repair industry, SEMA show in Las Vegas, we had one of our answers to that challenge on prominent display. Our new automated armored wheeler series wheel balancers, specifically designed for high-volume shops that require precision and reliability made from robust steel for enhanced and rugged durability. Even a small compact footprint, the balancers intelligent operating system uses sonar technologies to automatically measure both the wheel and RIM, eliminating the need for manual intervention, a great time saver in the shop. And for improved safety, the unit also includes heavy-duty pneumatic for us that physicians cumbersome tires on the spindle, making it unnecessary, protects and physically lift or manipulate the heavy assembly, substantially avoiding is the strain. The balancer also includes the high resolution touch screen and an intuitive interface and an effective ergonomic design. It's a powerful combination of accuracy, speed, durability and safety and the SEMA crowd clearly noticed. So that's RS&I. Shop repair remains robust. Vehicle complexity continues to advance abundant opportunities for a great future. The group has abundant opportunities for a great future and our RSI team has the products to take advantage. Well, that's our quarter and our year. For the quarter, sales up 3.5% as reported, 2.2% organically. OI margin reached 21.6%, up 10 basis points, and the EPS was $4.75, rising 7.5% and against the turbulence. The period was marked by extraordinary positives in the critical industry - in the critical industries that are C&I. The Tools Group not reaching our standard, but displaying margin gains and pivoting to match the technician shifting focus and RS&I, enabling both dealerships and independent shops to meet the challenges of higher complexity in new technologies and the full year 2023 sales of $4.7302 billion, up 5.6% organically, an OI of over $1 billion rising 10.5% and OI margin of 22%, an increase of 110 basis points, 110 basis points like that and EPS of $18.76, up $1.94 or 11.5%. It was another encouraging year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1196.6 billion in the quarter represented an increase of 3.5% from 2022 levels, reflecting a 2.2% organic sales gain, $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation and $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales. Sales were strong in our businesses serving critical industries this quarter while activity in our automotive repair market was mixed. Consolidated gross margin of 48.3%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to 48.5% last year. Benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from the company's RCI initiatives were offset by the effects of a higher mix of lower sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales improved 30 basis points to 26.7% from 27% last year, primarily due to lower corporate expenses and benefits from higher sales volumes, partially offset by increased investment in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $257.9 million in the quarter, compared to $248 million in 2022. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 21.6%, including 20 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects, compared to 21.5% last year. Financial services revenue of $97.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $88.3 million last year, while operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. Consolidated operating earnings of $325.8 million in the quarter compared to $311.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 25.2% compared to 25.1% in 2022. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 21.4% compared to 22% last year, while our full year 2023 tax rate of 22.5% compared to 22.8% last year. Net earnings of $255.3 million or $4.75 per diluted share, reflected an increase of $16.4 million or $0.33 per share from 2022 levels and represented a 7.5% year-over-year improvement in diluted earnings per share. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $363.9 million increased from $343.2 million last year, reflecting an $11.6 million or 3.3% and organic sales gain, $5.5 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Organic growth includes a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by a double-digit decline in sales of power tools. With respect to critical industries, sales to the military were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. As previously announced, during the quarter, Snap-on acquired Mountz Inc., a leading developer, manufacturer and marketer of high-precision torque tools. The acquisition complements and expands Snap-on's torque offering for a variety of critical industry applications. The operating results of Mountz are reported within the C&I group. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 39.2% in the fourth quarter from 37.7% in 2022. This was largely due to increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector pricing actions, savings from RCI initiatives and the 30 basis points of benefits from acquisitions. These improvements were partially offset by 60 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 60 basis points to 24.3% in the quarter from 23.7% in 2022, primarily due to a 30 basis point impact from acquisitions, as well as from investments in personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $54.1 million, including $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects compared to $47.9 million last year. The operating margin of 14.9%, including 50 basis points of unfavorable currency effects compared to 14% in 2022, reflecting an improvement of 90 basis points. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $513.3 million compared to $542.7 million a year ago, reflecting a 5.7% organic sales decline partially offset by $1.6 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in the U.S. business, partially offset by a mid-single digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 45.2% in the quarter from 43.2% last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreased sales of lower gross margin products, which includes lower sales of items where the Snap-on Tools Group serves as a distributor for products made by our C&I and RS&I groups. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 180 basis points to 23.6% in the quarter from 21.8% in 2022, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $111 million compared to $116.1 million last year. The operating margin of 21.6% compared to 21.4% in 2022. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $450.8 million, compared to $437.9 million in 2022, reflecting a 2% organic sales gain and $4.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a mid-single-digit gain in sales of undercar equipment. These gains were partially offset by a high single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent shop owners and managers. Gross margin was unchanged from last year with benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives, offset by increased sales and lower gross margin businesses. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 20 basis points to 19.9% from 19.7% last year, primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I group of $113.3 million compared to $10.6 million last year. The operating margin of 25.1% compared to 25.3% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $8.9 million to $97.2 million from $88.3 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services and operating earnings of $67.9 million compared to $63.9 million in 2022. Financial services expenses were up $4.9 million from 2022 levels, including $3.9 million of higher provisions for credit losses. The year-over-year increase in provision reflects both the growth of the portfolio, as well as a return to what we believe to be a more normal pre-pandemic rate of provision. For reference, our gross worldwide extended credit or finance receivable portfolio has increased 8.5% year-over-year, and we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance trends currently remain stable. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.8% and 17.6%. In the fourth quarters of 2023 and 2022, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Total loan originations of $33.1 million in the fourth quarter represented an increase of $3.4 million or 1.1% from 2022 levels. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. The 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% for U.S. extended credit was up from 1.6% in 2022, but was the same as in the pre-pandemic period of 2019. On a sequential basis, the rate is up 30 basis points, reflecting the seasonal uptick we typically experience between the third and fourth quarters. As it relates to extended credit or finance receivables, trailing 12-month net losses of $50.4 million, represented 2.59% of outstandings at quarter end, which compares to 2.51% as reported at the end of last quarter. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $296.9 million in the quarter, represented 114% of net earnings and compared to $210.6 million last year. The improvement as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, which included a reduction in inventory in 2023 as well as higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $104.6 million included $42.6 million for acquisitions, net additions to finance receivables of $42.2 million and capital expenditures of $21.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $149 million included cash dividends of $98 million, and the repurchase of 217,000 shares of common stock for $60.9 million under our existing share repurchase program. As of year-end, we had approximately $22.9 million of common stock under our existing authorizations available for repurchase. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $29.6 million from 2022 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days compared to 61 days as of 2022 year-end. Inventories decreased $27.2 million from 2022 year-end. And on a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3% compared to 2.5% at year-end 2022. Our year-end cash position of $1.15 billion compared to $757.2 million a year in 2022. Our net debt to capital ratio of 3.8% compared to 9% at year-end 2022. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of year-end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance, and I'll briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. We expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. In addition, we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Thanks, Al. The Snap-on fourth quarter and full year. Geographic variation, shifting customer perspective, growing macro uncertainties, all overcome by Snap-on's ability to wield disadvantages making the most of opportunities, continuing its positive and upward trend now demonstrated over multiple quarters and a significant number of years. The quarter did see the change in technicians perspective. And in pivoting with just the Tools Group volume did not meet our standards, but the tools team did blunt the difficulty with favorable mix and RCI driving improvement of OI margins up 20 basis points with the gross margin rising 200 basis points. The story with repair shop owners and managers was somewhat different. They recognize the need to upgrade and RS&I increase this rise in participation in OEM programs and extended its gains in undercar equipment, particularly in the expanding collision space. And finally, we saw C&I register another quarter of increasing importance to the corporation with the critical industries rising double digits and achieving another leap in margin reaching new margins, reaching new and significant levels. And it all resulted in a fourth quarter advancement against some substantial headwinds. Sales were up 3.5% as reported 2.2% organically. OI margins of 21.6% increased 10 basis points and an EPS of $4.75 rising 7.5%, all representing progress and a time when all was not where we'd like it to be. But I believe the bright-line story in this period is the full year sales for the corporation increased 5.6% organically. Opco OI margin rose 110 basis points, another significant advance and a long line of game reaching 22% for the first time, and the EPS was $18.76 up versus all comparisons.  And it was all offered by some noteworthy performance of the Tools Group, not encountering the smoothest sailing but still achieving an OI margin of 23.6%, an increase of 150 basis points. RS&I, sales up 6.7% organically and an OI margin of 24.3%, up 70 basis points off a strong base. And C&I, facing a landscape of challenges. We're growing 4.2% as reported 5% organically with an OI margin of 15.5%, up 140 basis points against 50 basis points of negative currency. And perhaps the biggest story of all is the emergence of the critical industry business, growing strong double digits in all four quarters demonstrating that we really can roll the Snap-on brand out of the garage at considerable margins. We see the quarter in the year as demonstrating that Snap-on does have multiple run rates for progress. And if one of our segments is challenged, we can still move forward achieving clear and continuing advancement driven by the other parts of the enterprise. And as such, we're encouraged by our presence and by our future. We believe that with our advantages in product, everyone recognizes we know work and we do make tasks easier. In brand, everywhere you go, among the - everywhere you go in the people of work, the Snap-on sign is displayed and spoken up with great pride. And in our people, a team, battle tested, who find the way forward and upwards despite the challenges, the results of 2023 say it so. And we believe, enabled by those advantages, Snap-on will overcome, we'll achieve and will advance continuing the positive trend throughout 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll address our franchisees and associates. I know they're all listening. I've spoken today with belief and confidence on our current situation on our way forward. I do so principally, but I do so principally because I know the capability and the quality demonstrated over and over by all of you. For your contributions and authoring our achievements, you have my congratulations. For the skills and energy you bring to our corporation every day, you have my admiration. And for the commitment you consistently display for the future of our mutual enterprise, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead. Luke Junk : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question here. Nick, for starters, I was hoping you could just expand. I know you mentioned some of these things in the prepared remarks already, but if you could just expand on Snap-on's most important growth drivers in the Tools Group as we go into 2024 here, really irrespective of what the market is giving you? And if you pivot aggressively enough, do you think that you can grow the tools business this earning? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes, I think we can. I mean, I think we've done it. We did it We did it in the pandemic era coming out of the pandemic when confidence was kind of still in the tools. If you look at the first four quarters after the pandemic, it was mostly on shorter payback items. So we can make a good business out of that. We made it at the tail end of the financial recession as well. So we think that's the capability. We are simply - as you might say, what we saw coming out of the FFC, everybody was sort of business as usual, pumped up and they were ordering to a general mix of product. And then on late October and November, things started to look a little different to our franchisees, and they wanted to make a pivot because they had been through this rodeo before, and so they wanted to redirect. That's what we're doing. We think we have great things in hand tools and in diagnostics and in tool storage carts and maybe some of the lower lines of tool storage boxes themselves like at the classic series. So we're going to focus on that. That doesn't mean we're going to abandon the bigger ticket items, things like maybe Triton and so on in diagnostics or - which we believe is very strong but - or our boxes. But we're going to shift our focus. And it's important to talk about the capacity, Luke, because remember, we were already kind of bumping up the capacity, and we're fighting to expand it. And so what you want to do in this situation is try to use that expanded capacity in a redirected manner. So we actually have the volumes in the places we think are selling now. So we feel pretty good about that. Our product lineup is good. We've got a good - as I said, product leads the way. We've got a great array of hand tools coming forward. We got new tool boxes, diagnostics, power tools, all those things are going to work for us, we believe. So the way forward is, one, continue to drive the products, make sure we can actually deliver them. And then thirdly, as always, to try to help the franchisees in selling giving them more time to sell - and maybe sometimes it might take a little longer in this situation. So that's why we're deploying our field guys to get out there and provide a little bit more energy and time to the actual selling process. So we think it's a reasonable pivot. This is - again, it's not our first rodeo. It's not the Tools Group's first rodeo. So we think, okay, things have changed a little bit. We know how to respond. Luke Junk : Thanks for that. And then I guess a related question would be the shift in mechanic sentiments that you saw mid fall. Just how do you think that improves the appetite for credit here and as you tracked either originations or just other trends in book, I'm thinking more from the demand side, Nick? Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, yes, you probably see less credit use in that situation. I mean, the originations were \u2013 I think Al was set down 1% in the United States in the quarter. So I mean, I think you see that kind of thing. And if you go back and you look at our numbers, say, coming out of COVID, let's say, quarter three and four of 2020 and first second quarter of 2021, you'll see that kind of phenomenon. So that could be the case. Now this is early days for this. Our people sense it. Well, the good thing about this is our people sensed it right away. And so sensing it, they changed their words that put a little strain on a factory because when you change the orders, it makes the capacity shrink a little bit. So you have those kinds of things. So I believe you may see a little pivoting away from that. Now I think this is right in tune with everything. I do believe, I've said it many times that there is a bifurcation economy that there's a financial economy, the kinds of people that I said in my talk that my remarks that we're talking about the recession is coming and recession is coming and the people are saying we're going to have a soft landing now. But the people at the grass level have a different view of the world. And if you look at the Wall Street Journal, the front page say and the paper position, there's an article saying just this. Actually, I met a bunch of franchisees, and I met a huge number of people in the factories and in garages in places like Conway and Louisville and a little bit in Tennessee and Milwaukee. So and they all kind of say the same thing. They got jobs. They got the cash coming in. But every day they get up and get bad news for breakfast. And you start to wonder about what's going to happen. So it's not that things are bad today, but people worry about how things are going to happen and what's going to happen in the future. And I think all of us looking at the events might say that's true. Luke Junk : Okay. And then maybe a final question. This one might be for Aldo. Just hoping on what happened in the car tools business, specifically this quarter, if we look at the inter-segment, so it seems like things maybe step down quite a bit. I'm just trying to reconcile what you saw in order trends versus your impression of underlying trends in power tools. Is it possible that there is sort of a onetime adjustment in orders to level set inventory on the bans in power tools. Am I thinking about that right? Aldo Pagliari : So in some ways, there's another buffer stock in between the tools maintained its own levels of inventory. So you're right, simply the Tools Group had less need to buy as much in power tools and diagnostics in the quarter. It doesn't mean necessarily that that flows onto one through the demand because you have inventories in between, both inventories at demand itself and the inventories in the hands of the Tools Group. But you have lower sales from C&I and from RS&I to the Tools Group, reflects actually pretty much power tools and diagnostic related products. Nicholas Pinchuk : Actually, yes, I'd offer that - what you're seeing a phenomenon as you're seeing, as Aldo said, some adjustment there. And if you look at \u2013 if you actually look at careful look at C&I, you see they actually had a pop quarter to their traditional customers. But what happens in the power tools business is our new CT9038 came out 18 volt, it sold great, then this happened. And that kept selling, but the bigger ticket items in power tools, like the 18 volts just dropped off and people tended to want the 144 volt. Our supply chains are a little longer for that. We couldn't supply all of that. So you have that kind of situation. But if you look at the Tools Group level, power tools are not down, especially an outstanding amount. It's mostly between the Tools Group and C&I. Luke Junk : Got it. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Patrick Buckley : Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Patrick Buckley on for Bret. Thanks for taking our questions. Nicholas Pinchuk : Okay. Patrick Buckley : Could you talk a bit more on pricing versus units within the Tools Group. And then looking ahead, are pricing actions on the table here? Or is it more focused on pushing the shorter payable tools? Nicholas Pinchuk : No. Pricing, we generally have - except in inflationary, exceptional inflationary times, which we've all been through more or less recently is we get 30 to 40 basis points of pricing, something like that. Most of our advancement basically comes from RCI and new product, which gets its margins. We get our margins for new products. We don't plan changing that approach. We're not really going to make a major adjustment in pricing going forward. This is more about shorter payback versus longer payback. It's the - think of it this way. It's just take a simple thing as a tool storage unit. Okay, you can buy a big epic and boy, they are great. People love them. They bring people up and show them their box, and they say, this is my dream, but that's not a quick payback. That's a longer payback. You got to work a long time and get efficiency from the size of that and the features in that to get a payback. But if you get yourself a cart, you can move from your workplace out into the shop, particularly in some of these independent chefs out into the shop yard or all over the shop. And that gives you immediate savings in time just there. And so that's the kind of thing I'm talking about is that shift to the idea. Is this thing going to pay for me right away, pay me back right away? Wrenches do that, particularly like the synergy I talked about here, which is a leap forward in terms of reliability and access and swing arc and make the jobs easier and able to beat the flat rate faster. So those are the kinds of things we're betting on. We've seen it work before. So I think the good thing about this is Tools Group saw it started to move on. Patrick Buckley : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then was there anything notable to call out in the corporate expense line and Q4 seemed to take a step down from the run rate we saw in the past few years? Aldo Pagliari : So we had lower spending in the quarter on legal expenses in particular. We had a favorable settlement on a matter. So it was able to reduce our expenditures in the quarter. But the run rate for corporate expenses is running in a typical fashion. Nicholas Pinchuk : Actually, it's about $113 million. It's $113 million in the year. That's up $5 million to $6 million year-over-year. Aldo Pagliari : $113 million versus $1.08 million. Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Patrick Buckley : Got it. That\u2019s all for us. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question is from Scott Stember with Roth MKM. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Scott Stember : Nick, could you split out the different subsegments within tools, hand tools, power tools, obviously, sounds like color tools were down, but - and storage units, things like that? Thanks. Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, it wasn't a lot of good - being down 5.7% is not a lot of good news to go around. The big kahuna moving downwards was diagnostics. They saw it diagnostics, and we have several ranges of diagnostics and the latest introduced was the soles - it's the low end of - I don't want to say low end, it's the lowest priced version of our product. And that pay in the quarter, not as well as we might have hoped in our situations. But what kind of went down was ZEUS, the top of the line and the next one down to Triton. And ZEUS had been introduced last year in the fourth quarter, so those comparisons around. But the biggest kahuna down was that. And then after that, I think actually Tool storage is up slightly, but all because of cards, pretty much because of carts and shop and tech were down. So, hand tools were down some. But if you looked at it, the thing that - one of the things that drove the margins, I think the important point out of that, Scott, what drove the margin improvement in the Tools Group despite the lower volume was that the stuff they make, the carts at Algona, the tool storage items and the hand tools were a bigger portion of their sales than in prior year - in the prior year. And so that that welded a much greater mix because from hands and what the tools group sells for hand tools and tool storage, they get both distribution and manufacturer margins for things like diagnostics and power tools and shopping tech stuff, they only get the distribution margin. So, there's a pretty big difference between those. So, you can get some pretty good news or bad news depending on how that mix works. Scott Stember : So, going forward, obviously, you're focusing on quicker payback items. So, obviously, that would be hand tools? You're going to start cranking that up a little bit more? Nicholas Pinchuk : You would say it this way. I mean there's - we like to think, Scott, that we could find quicker payback items than everything. Hand tools clearly mostly often, I should say often, our quick payback. The technicians can see quick payback. Certain versions of tool storage, as I've said, the carts in particular, which tend to be substantially cheaper and more efficacious because they're kind of an option to add on to a big box. And then or somebody can't afford a lot and wants to just get a Snap-On tool storage in some way at an affordable level. And then the lower end of that product, the classic series, which we're working on having in terms of in terms of programs coming up, which we've got scheduled for February and March. And so that would be the case. Diagnostics, it all tends to be bigger ticket items. So, there are - there is the sales at the lower end, and we have some - bring out a new diagnostic at some point during the year, which creates interest. But the lower ticket items is just at the bottom end of diagnostics. And then power tools can have I don't want to say big ticket items, but the 18 volts are a little more expensive. 14-volt is a lot more affordable and you tend to have a very focused application for where the 18-volt tends to be broader applications to bring that power to any place whereas the 18 - the 14-volt tend to be saying, I got this problem in this particular chassis area of the car I see, so I'm going to use that 14-volt. So, that tends to be quick payback as well. Those are the kinds of things you see. Scott Stember : Got it. And then just a last question on the bigger picture. You said that the overall market, the underlying conditions look pretty strong. You're not seeing any warning signs for the businesses themselves, demand. I mean O'Reilly reported last night, and they said that their the professional business was up double-digits. So, I just want to make sure that we're not - this is not a canary in the coal mine that the underlying business-- Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't think so. I mean I think everybody says the business is good. I mean, I don't know. First of all, I have two amps to that. One is the metrics. If you look at the BOL data, that all seems positive. I mean, the miles driven are up in that. It's a long way thing. But the spending on - household spending on repair up 4% year-over-year. That's a pretty good number. The number of tech up 4.5%. I used to be 1%. They're growing at 4.5%. The technician wage is up 7%. So those kinds of things good things and the car park, of course, keeps growing, and so they keep pumping it in. And the auto industry, while this doesn't make a difference too much is starting to come back, and they're still rolling out those new technologies. So all that seems to be from a quantitative point of view seems to be positive. Now the Bureau labor data can trail, so I don't know, and people have questions about that. But then, when you go out in the windshield survey and you talk to not only the people our franchisees who are out there every day, but to talk to the general people who work, they think cash is rolling for them. They're not going to say they're cash rich, but they are. And so I think things look good right now. And I don't expect this to change. Scott Stember : Got it. And just to firm up a follow-up on something you said earlier. You would not be surprised to see the Tools Group return to positive organic growth? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, we don't give guidance. But I think I said like four times in my remarks, they weren't at standard. Scott Stember : Got it. Nicholas Pinchuk : We expect them to grow. If we don't, if we don't grow, they will be below our expectations. Scott Stember : Got it. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Nicholas Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : And our last question today comes from David McGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David McGregor : Yes. Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking my questions. Let me just start by sort of picking up on the last line of questioning. It sounds like hand tools and storage is doing maybe a little bit better in relative terms. But that's also where you were adding capacity in Elizabeth and Milwaukee and Algona. Are they doing a little bit better because you finally just have a little more capacity you're able to liquidate some of that backlog? Or is there maybe a better underlying demand story in those categories? Nicholas Pinchuk : That's a complicated question because of the situation, you know? I mean, I guess, I don't know. I think this way, though, I'm pretty sure we're doing better because we had in the queue some ability to adjust for shorter payback items in those areas. That's pretty much the way I can answer it. Now what I will tell you is - David, this is an operating guys song is that when you're thinking that you're going to have - you're going to have promotions rolling out of your factories and all of a sudden, your customers come up and, say, never mind, we want to go over here. This tends to create a lot of, shall I say, inefficiencies. And so you have to adjust to that. So I don't think we got the full result the capacities we had hoped the capacity expansions we had hoped to get in the fourth quarter because of those changes, they just optimize what you've added. And so that's part of - that's a factor in all of this. Yes, the backlog for - some of the backlog for tool storage was down. So we liquidated some of that, but we still have backlog in those areas. So it's a complicated answer, I think. You might have some of that. But on the other hand, we couldn't fulfill it as much. We couldn't have liquidated as much as we would have had we had full - had been able to roll in the way we had planned to roll in our production plans coming out of the SFC. David McGregor : Okay. Just a couple of other questions for you, Nick and Aldo, the trucks, I would love to get your sense if your organic growth was down 5.7%. What do you think the truck sell-through was? Nicholas Pinchuk : I sort of know what it was, and it was better than that in the quarter and for the year, generally is better. This all tends to come out in the wash though - in the long run. But in the fourth quarter, the trucks were not down. We're substantially. They were still down, but not anything like the Tools Group. David McGregor : Down low single digits? Nicholas Pinchuk : Yes. Sure. I mean so you would say maybe the - you don't know, but they've kind of liquidated some things. So part of it is delivery - if you pick a particular product and you say a shift to that product, we do have inventory, but the point is sometimes you don't have that product and you have to make changes in the factory, sometimes we couldn't even deliver what they wanted. David McGregor : Let me just shift to credit for a second, if I could. And Aldo, you normally share the breakdown on originations between finance receivables and credit receivables. Would you be kind enough to do that for us again this quarter? Aldo Pagliari : You see the receivables, the originations were down, and that was more than offset by contract receivables. And similar to the results of the Tools Group, EC originations in the United States were down more than what we saw internationally. It was actually up in terms of EC originations. So that kind of gives you some of the blend. David McGregor : Okay. And I guess within those origination numbers, can you distinguish between merchandise versus franchisees flipping RA and DC? Aldo Pagliari : Actually, I was pleased to say, I know you're asking, David, actually, in the quarter, there's less than what would be the typical mix of what we call transfers, RA transfers where they transfer items from the revolving accounts over to EC. There's actually less of an effect of that. But for the full year, it's very consistent with where we expect it to be. So there's been no signs of franchisees using the credit company to finance their operations by moving things from their revolving accounts across I think that's what you're after. David McGregor : Yes. And do you get a sense that there's an opportunity here to maybe I mean, you've got a very high-quality credit portfolio. I don't think that's ever been a doubt. Certainly, certainly, that's our sense. Do you get a sense there's maybe an opportunity here to relax a little on the credit standard in order to reinvigorate demand? Nicholas Pinchuk : No. David McGregor : It was a nice tight answer, Nick. Nicholas Pinchuk : Well, if that was me. Aldo Pagliari : If you think about what we said, people are lacking confidence to some degree for big-ticket items. I don't think the way hold is to discount the interest rate you're going to charge those to provoke a sale. So we're not into the - discounting isn't usually our style. It doesn't mean we might not come up with creative promotions and bundling and things like that. But I don't think discounting is the way. David McGregor : And so what's the take on the regional kickoffs? Just help us think through first half that you're seeing in regional kickoff. Nicholas Pinchuk : I think we usually comment on the kickoffs usually in the first quarter call. But in general, and we tried to shift the kickoff at the last moment for - we took a different approach to kickoffs this time. We saw this problem. We try to concentrate on shorter payback items that seemed to go reasonably okay with those items. And then we established a little more program in February and March, thinking that if we kind of stretch the kickoffs into other months, then we would be able to have better adjustments to the current situation. So that's sort of what we did in the kickoff. I was at one in Las Vegas and turn yes, they usually send me the Deadwood, South North Dakota. This time, I got to go to Las Vegas. And we had the Canadian guys there. That seemed to go okay. They seem to be positive. The franchisees don't seem to be daunted by this. They just report what they see. David McGregor : Right. The last question for me is just maybe on the competitive dynamics. You've been fairly steady in terms of the number of trucks you have on the road now for quite a number of years. gather, maybe there's a few more company-owned versus franchise within the mix overall. But at the same time, your competitors have been increasing the number of trucks on the road. You sense this is starting to have a little bit of an impact on it. Do you feel like maybe there was a little bit of share loss this quarter versus some of your peers? Nicholas Pinchuk : I don't know. I don't like to - I never like to talk about share. I never talked about share when our numbers were booming upwards, and I don't talk about it now. You could think that, but I don't think so. I think, look, we got - we have - I don't think - I think we're covering the universe with the 3,400-or-so franchisees that we have - so you could argue that some locations might be seeing competition where they haven't. But there are a few locations, David, that don't have any competition. So what does happen sometimes is tough, okay, somebody one or two or three. One of the other competitors will put somebody in place. But that guy, our guy in that territory has already been dealing with people and the other guy has its own competition and it might create more business. But I never hear the franchisees saying that. Why you logically might think that would be the case, and we think about it all the time, and I ask the question all the time, but they almost never say that. In fact, never. David McGregor : Are you seeing any change in franchisee attrition rates? Nicholas Pinchuk : No, that's pretty held the same, pretty much the same in the quarter. So franchisees, just in the quarter, we saw more - I think we saw more longer than the Tool guys leave in the quarter, an interesting phenomenon. But that was - that's just a sort of anecdotal view of it. I don't not sure that could make some difference, but I don't think we worry about that in particular in terms of the day-to-day dynamics of the competition. David McGregor : Got it. Thanks very much. That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. Good luck, gentlemen. Nicholas Pinchuk : Hi, thanks. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : The conference is now concluded.

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our first quarter. I'll provide my perspectives on the results, on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. We believe that our first quarter once again demonstrated Snap-on's ability to maintain its strength to engage headwinds, to manage challenges and to leverage the multiple opportunities of our markets. Looking at the results in total, we are encouraged. Like most quarters, we had turbulence from geography to geography and from operation to operation. North America was mixed, but with significant gains in critical industries. Internationally, our consolidated results were also mixed, but yielding overall positives as our operations in Europe and Asia overcame the effects of recessions in Europe and the delayed recovery in China. Now the results. First quarter sales were $1,182.3 million about flat to last year on an organic basis, excluding $6.7 million from acquisitions and $2.5 million from favorable foreign currency our sales were lower by 0.8%. OpCo OI was $270.9 million, an increase of $11.1 million and the Opco operating margin for the quarter was 22.9%, up 90 basis points. Now both those numbers benefited from the legal payment referenced in our release. But with or without that legal flow, our first quarter Opco OI and the margin were among our best. It's a strong statement given the turbulence of the day. Financial Services. Operating income grew to $68.3 million from last year's $66.3 million, and the results combined with Opco to raise our consolidated operating margin to 26.5%, up over the 25.6% recorded last year. And EPS, it was $4.91, including a per share benefit from a legal payment of $0.16, but up $0.31 or 6.7% from last year. So those are the numbers. Now let's turn to the markets and the trends we're seeing as we connect with our customers. From an overall perspective, we believe the automotive repair arena remains favorable. Vehicle OEM and dealerships continue investing in tools and equipment, preparing for the tie to new models, bringing the latest technology and drivetrains to the market. And in the quarter, our Repair Systems & Information Group, or RS&I, as we call it, expanded our reach into OEM programs and took advantage of the opportunities throughout its global footprint. And as we look forward, we see further prospects for RS&I capitalizing on that trend supplying dealerships and independent garages with just the products they need to confront the wave of modern platforms that are coming. So the shops are strong. Now let's speak of a technician. The guys and gals that twirl the wrenches, punch the keys, or tap the screens. This quarter, I have multiple occasions to visit with franchisees. And the report was generally that shops are humming, the bays are running at full capacity, and all that mirrors what the macro data says naturally. The car park is continuing to age. Now at an average of 12.5 years, and I think moving up, technician wages are rising and their hours worked are increasing. We believe it all signals ongoing and robust demand for repair. And you know it's true. The activity is strong, but there is a difference between the industry overview and the technician outlook for the future and by extension, their purchasing sentiment. The barrage of bad news, inflation, towards the border, the Red Sea, the election, the Iran bombing for the people of work, the fear of what's coming around the corner impacts the outlook and paraphrasing the characters of Dune, fear is the outlook killer. It erodes confidence. Techs are well positioned, and they continue to invest but it's in quick payback items that will make a difference right away, but don't require a long-term payment stream. And in response, we're continuing to redirect \u2013 we continue to redirect the Tools Group focus in our design efforts and our facility capacity and our selling and marketing efforts, working to match the current customer preference. So that's the auto repair. Now our Commercial and Industrial Group or what we call C&I, serving critical industries in the most international of all our groups, and in the quarter, C&I manages the difficult challenge of balancing multiple economies that are in economic turbulence. Europe now has more than half a dozen countries in technical recession. And then China \u2013 in the China environment, including the nearby countries, depending on it, they continue to struggle. India on the other hand, it's booming. Modi has the train running. So that's a positive in Asia amidst some very difficult economies. So that's the geographies. Now let's focus on the sectors. Areas like aviation continue to be strong. You don't have to read the paper very long to realize there's a significant focus on aerospace production and repair where the price for failure is high, and that arena is increasing demand for our precision torque products and for our asset control solutions to improve safety and productivity. In addition, in that sort of critical arena, custom kits, matching a set of items to a particular task it may it's an important business, especially for the military, both domestically and internationally. And with that, Critical industries is a substantial opportunity, and we are investing, expanding capacity, adding new products either organically or through the acquisitions we made over the last few years worth fortifying our runways for growth, extending outside the garage, and we know it\u2019s paying off. So overall, the quarter was favorable despite the headwinds, Tools Group pivoting, RS&I expanding with OEMs, C&I extending beyond the garage solving the critical. And the OpCo OI percentage demonstrated once again the power Snap-on\u2019s value creation processes, safety, quality, customer connection and innovation and rapid continuous improvement, developing innovative solutions that are born out of insight and observations right in the workplace. This understanding melded with RCI, helps Snap-on to once again hold fast in the turbulence of the day. Well, that's the macro overview. Now let's move to the segments. In the C&I Group, sales were $359.9 million, representing a decrease of $3.9 million or 1.1%, and that includes $6.7 million in acquisitions, acquisition-related sales, $1.4 million in unfavorable foreign currency and an organic decline of 2.5%. It all reflects higher activity with customers in critical industries, more than offset by weakness in Asia-Pacific and in our power tools. From an earnings perspective, C&I operating income was $55.4 million. That was about the same as last year. The operating margin was 15.4%, up 10 basis points, and that was despite 30 basis points of headwind from currency and the acquisitions. Within the quarter, the demand for custom kits, addressing particular critical tasks remain nicely robust with increased demand for control solutions like our Automated Tool Control products. It was a nice bright spot in C&I. On the other hand, power tools was down in the quarter, but help is on the way. Tuning power tool models born out of customer connection were recently introduced, each fulfilling specific needs for \u2013 each fulfilling specific needs. For repair garages, we launched the PH3045B AirHamer. This is a tool that replicates the effect of swinging a hammer and hitting a sizzle except the device, hurdles the hammer 3,500 times a minute. Vehicles are filled with components like ball joints, wheel bearing, suspension bushings that are packed in tight fit for maximum efficiency. This assembly can be a bear. We know this from being in the garage. While with our new AirHamer, the easy-to-use retainer securely holds a chisel in place while the piston sledge hammers away. It's powerful. But at the same time, the compact two-inch barrel \u2013 the two-inch barrel enables the access in tight spaces, delivering tremendous power, speed and energy with unlimited run time. It's a real productivity enhancer, but the essential feature born out of watching the technicians in the shop is the best-in-class vibration reduction, created by special elastomer shocks, allowing the mechanic to pound away at these suspension components without fatigue or paying, no more store arms from hammer work. The new hammer was introduced late in the quarter and techs have already noticed. Also on power tools, our cordless portfolio expanded with the introduction of a new 18-volt nibbler designed for collision repair and metal fabrication. It's a big time saver. It speeds up work that once involve hand shears or other devices, help technicians cut any free-form shake conceivable out of tough sheet metal. Again, the design resulted from customer connection from watching the tech struggle with shears. Our new nibbler makes a big difference when cutting in defenders extracting a damaged panel or cutting a ceiling of a car accommodating installation of a sunroof or creating a place anywhere in the vehicle for placing emergency lighting, shining away for first responders. I have to tell you, I have to tell you, we are encouraged by these innovative new products. And by all the others we're planning to introduce as the days go forward. We know work and they all will make a difference right away. C&I, a quarter confronted with international headwinds, strong momentum in domestic markets, led by critical industries, extending out of the garage with growing strength. Now let's talk about the Tools Group. The first quarter for the Tools Group was below our standard. However, we do remain confident, and we do see a pivot to focus on quick payback items registering a positive momentum and movement. Sales in the quarter were $500.1 million, including \u2013 reflected an organic decrease \u2013 including an organic decrease or reflecting an organic decrease of 7%. The Group's operating income margin was 23.5%, down 100 basis points. Notably, gross margin in the quarter rose 90 basis points, reaching 48.2%. You see shorter payback margins aren't shorter on profitability. During the quarter, we worked to redirect our plants, guide our franchisees to innovate solutions that drive productivity, and we kept engaging our customer connection, observing the task executed in the bay and using the insights to design and deploy innovative and focused products offerings that are dedicated to making work easier, like two new products, just engineers \u2013 just engineered to address time-consuming tasks where simple repairs are made complex by limited \u2013 made complex by limited accessibility or by seized components that slow the work to a snail's pace. You can see it in the garage. For instance, on General Motors, 6L80 and 8L90 transmissions, the valve body bolts are obstructed by the exhaust set up, making it very taxing to do this job with a standard ratchet or socket combination. We were in some \u2013 we were in some of those GM garages and observed the problem firsthand, classic customer connection. And the innovation that followed in our quarter-inch drive Torx Plus EPL-10 low-profile inverted socket. That's a mouthful. That innovation was released in the first quarter, and it does make GM transmission work easier. The new cushion design precisely maneuver \u2013 the new custom design precisely maneuvers between the exhaust assembly and the transmission engaging the fastener in such a way that provides enough clearance for a ratcheting box or a box-end wrench or a hand ratchet to access the bolts for easy removal with no exhaust disassembly require saving more than 45 minutes per repair right away. Techs working on GM transmissions can complete more work with this device and make more money. They can do that right away, quick payback. Another example we saw, another example of that was we saw that removing the brake caliber pins on Toyota trucks and sports utilities was very difficult. The pins on 4Runners, Tacomas and Tundras are exposed to harsh road environments, often causing the parts to become immovable, regularly requiring like heat or excessive force to free the restricted fasteners. And each of those methods requires time and it raises the risk of damage to nearby components often elevating the complexity of the repair, taking a lot more time, watching the work. Our engineers produced a unique punch like bit that precisely aligned to an air hammer with the dimensions of the pin, maximizing the extraction force without endangering the surrounding systems. Once again, simplifying the task and freeing the tech to move on to other jobs. It's another quick payback item that's now available and popular. Finally in the quarter, we expanded our only \u2013 the only U.S.-made locking plier lineup by releasing two new models, the LP5LN constructed with a tapered nose. It's ideal for additional reach inside compliance space to easily access narrow workpieces. And the new LP5WC delivering a reliable gripping power is difficult to engage round objects like hoses. Beyond the special features of those two models, the full line offers our subcompact six-inch plier line offers increased accessibility and \u2013 because it's small enabling text to maneuver and crowded engine compartments and under the dash. The design also provides unmatched clamping forces, that locking pliers, unmatched clamping forces that will not slip under load with the locking mechanism. The pliers also serve as a second pair of hands. They're going to lock them up \u2013 locking up, holding materials, securely in place, freeing up the technician's hands to complete another step in the repair. And each unit, each of those locking plier units is forged and produced on our Elkmont, Alabama plant, and they're the only locking models made in the U.S. Well, that is the Tools Group, pivoting to match the technician's current preferences and needs, wielding our customer connections, deploying solutions that improve efficiency by making tasks easier. Now RS&I. The RS&I Group's results confirmed, I think, what we've been saying all along, Snap-on is well positioned to support repair shops, both dealers and the vast networks of independent shops. And in that regard, RS&I sales in the quarter were $463.8 million, up $17.2 million or 3.9% versus last year with an organic sales increase of 3.3%. Operating earnings for the group reached $112.9 million, reflecting an increase of $8.3 million or 7.9% versus last year. The operating income margin was 24.3%, rising by 90 basis points, a powerful performance driven by OEM-related activity and sales in undercar, helping shops prepare for new technologies. In terms of OEM-related activity and sales in undercar helping shops prepare for new technologies and enabling system upgrades in the growing collision market. We continue to seek to clearly see abundant runways for growth in RS&I, and we're working to take advantage. One example of that is the launch of our new heavy-duty repair information software. This package combines the vehicle interface capabilities of our NEXIQ heavy-duty diagnostic units with the horsepower of our Mitchell 1 information database. It's an innovative solution for repair and heavy-duty industry, which over the past decade has seen an explosion of new technologies relating to sophisticated emission control along with advanced computer and electrical networks that all combines to present heavy mechanics with complex and complicated repair tasks. Now the solutions \u2013 now with solutions all located in one spot, tests can search by VIN number and access operating specification, troubleshooting tips and interactive wiring diagrams, all be specific to the particular vehicle, all big time savers and existing products was deployed in the quarter, and it's a groundbreaking integrated platform. The combined diagnostic capability together with vehicle information, it's very powerful. And I can tell you, the heavy-duty industry has noticed. You can see it in the RS&I numbers. And in the quarter, our Diagnostics division also released its latest 24.2 software upgrade, expanding our broad range of vehicle coverage and test procedures throughout all our existing hardware. The new upgrade strengthens our already market-leading data positions. Technicians get access to our SureTrack vehicle-specific real fixes, repair tips and commonly replaced parts, all derived from our proprietary database of 2.7 billion repair actions and 355 billion data records unmatched insight, not only to interpret what the vehicle trouble codes are saying but to uniquely use the information to determine the exact problem, analyzing millions of data lines per car, predicting the most likely repair. Snap-on uniquely provides this capability. And in this latest update, we continue adding new models and functionalities, making our proprietary software position even more effective and more powerful. We\u2019re confident in the strength of RS&I. And we keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers to make \u2013 by making work easier with more and more great new products. Well, that\u2019s Snap-on\u2019s first quarter, sales flat, overcoming the significant headwinds, critical industries advancing, again, the tools group pivoting, matching the preference for quick payback products. OEM undercar repair information markets are remaining robust. The Opco OI margin, 22.9%, up 90 basis points and an EPS of $4.91, strong results that overcame the headwinds and benefited from a legal outcome. All demonstrating the strength in the midst of turbulence, it was an encouraging quarter. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,182.3 million in the quarter compared to $1,183 million last year, reflecting an 0.8% organic sales decline, partially offset by $6.7 million of acquisition-related sales and $2.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Activity in our automotive repair markets was mixed, gains in sales to OEM and independent shop owners and managers were more than offset by lower sales to technicians through our franchise van channel. Within the industrial sector for our C&I group, sales to customers in critical industries were up mid-single digits in the quarter as compared to last year. Consolidated gross margin of 50.5% improved 70 basis points from 49.8% last year, primarily reflecting benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from the company\u2019s RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 27.6% compared to 27.8% last year. In the quarter, as noted in our press release, operating expenses included an $11.3 million benefit for payments received associated with the legal matter. The 20 basis point improvement in the operating expense ratio is primarily due to the benefit from the legal payment partially offset by increased personnel and other costs, which includes a 20 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings before financial services of $270.9 million in the quarter, including the benefit from the legal payment compared to $259.8 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22.9% compared to 22% last year. Financial services revenue of $99.6 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $92.6 million last year, while operating earnings of $68.3 million compared to $66.3 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $339.2 million, which included the legal benefit compared to $326.1 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 26.5% compared to 25.6% in 2023. Our first quarter effective income tax rate of 22.2% compared to 23.1% last year. Net earnings of $263.5 million or $4.91 per diluted share, including an $8.8 million or $0.16 per diluted share after tax benefit from the legal payment compared to $248.7 million or $4.60 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2023. Now, let\u2019s turn to our segment results for the quarter, starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $359.9 million compared to $363.8 million last year, reflecting a 2.5% organic sales decline and a $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $6.7 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic decrease is primarily due to a double-digit reduction in the power tools business and a high-single digit decline in the segment\u2019s Asia-Pacific operations mostly associated with lower intersegment sales. These declines were partially offset by a mid-single digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries. With respect to critical industries, military and defense related sales were robust as was activity in the aviation sector. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 40.8% in the first quarter from 38.8% in 2023. This is largely due to increased volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector. Lower material costs and other cost savings from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points from the benefit of acquisitions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 190 basis points to 25.4% in the quarter from 23.5% in 2023 primarily due to the effects of lower sales volumes, investments in personnel and other costs and a 70 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $55.4 million compared to $55.8 million last year. The operating margin of 15.4% compared to 15.3% in 2023. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $500.1 million compared to $537 million a year ago, reflecting a 7% organic sales decline, partially offset by $600,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a mid-single digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin improved 90 basis points to 48.2% in the quarter from 47.3% last year. This improvement primarily reflects decreased sales of lower gross margin products. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 190 basis points to 24.7% in the quarter from 22.8% in 2023, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $117.3 million compared to $131.7 million last year. The operating margin of 23.5% compared to 24.5% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $463.8 million compared to $446.6 million in 2023 reflecting a 3.3% organic sales gain and $2.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase includes a high-single digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships and a low-single digit gain in sales of undercar equipment. Gross margin improved 150 basis points to 45% from 43.5% last year, primarily due to benefits from lower material and other costs and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 60 basis points to 20.7% from 20.1% last year primarily reflecting increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $112.9 million compared to $104.6 million last year, the operating margin of 24.3% compared to 23.4% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7 million or 7.6% to $99.6 million from $92.6 million last year, primarily reflecting growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $68.3 million compared to $66.3 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $5 million from 2023 levels, including $4.3 million of higher provisions for credit losses. In the first quarters of both 2024 and 2023, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, the average yields on contract receivables were 9% and 8.7%, respectively. Total loan originations of $301.7 million in the first quarter represented an increase of $800,000 or 0.3% from 2023 levels. Increased originations of contract receivables were mostly offset by a low single-digit decline in extended credit originations. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables, with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.8% is up 30 basis points from the first quarter of 2023, but unchanged from the rate reported last quarter. Trailing 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $54.1 million, representing 2.75% of outstandings at quarter end, which is up 16 basis points from the end of last quarter. Considering the current environment and despite these slight upward trends, we believe the delinquency and portfolio performance metrics remain relatively stable. Now turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $348.7 million in the quarter represented 129% of net earnings and compared to $301.6 million last year. The improvement as compared to the first quarter of 2023 largely reflects lower year-over-year increases in working investment, which included a reduction in inventory during the quarter as well as higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $63.2 million primarily reflected net additions to finance receivables of $40.2 million and capital expenditures of $21.8 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $164.2 million included cash dividends of $98.2 million and the repurchase of 248,000 shares of common stock for $70.2 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $290.6 million of common stock under our existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $36.2 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 63 days compared to 60 days as of year-end and to 62 days as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. Inventories decreased $35.4 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.3 at year-end 2023. Our quarter end cash position of $1,121 million compared to $1,001.5 million at year-end 2023. Our net debt to capital ratio of 1.5% compared to 3.8% at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility, and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our first quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. With respect to corporate expenses, in the second quarter, we believe we could benefit from a legal payment similar to that received in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be in a range of $100 million to $110 million, and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Alan. Well, that's the first quarter. Strength in the midst of turbulence. Even with a part of the enterprise below standard, you see Snap-on is a business that reaches varied customers in different industries and in various geographies united in a coherence that is the criticality of work, the essential nature of what we do. And we have the opportunity and advantage \u2013 we have opportunity and advantage in virtually all of those arenas. And as a consequence, even when the largest of our entities is not a standard, we find a way in other areas to maintain overall strength. It's that coherent strategic breadth and the experience and capability of our team to execute that has made Snap-on so resilient, moving consistently upwards for all these years, and this quarter was another demonstration of that resilience. C&I, engaging economic challenges across geographies, extending to critical industries, proving that Snap-on can roll out of the garage, exploiting a considerable opportunity and do it profitably. The Tools Group acting to adapt, committing to accommodate the tech's certain outlook and their preference for quick payback products and doing it with still enviable margins. In fact, with gross margins up 90 basis points showing the promise of their pivot. RS&I, seeing opportunities with repair shop owners and managers and making the most of it despite the challenges in Europe, volume and margins growing in a very imperfect environment and the credit company, working against the grain of short payback preferences and still raising profit. And it all came together to keep activity flat despite the difficulty to register an Opco operating margin of 22.9%, up 90 basis points and to record an EPS of $4.91, numbers that are among our strongest ever results with or without the legal benefit. And as such, we look ahead with confidence, fortified by our inherent advantages in our product, deep, wide and growing, solving more critical tasks every day, advantages in our brand. Snap-on is the outward sign of pride, working men and women taking their jobs and advantage in our people, committed, capable turbulence tested many times a team that knows how to ring the positive out of the difficult and fueled by those advantages, we believe Snap-on will maintain its strength, moving positively throughout the 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I\u2019ll speak directly to our franchisees and associates worldwide. The first quarter was a resilient and robust demonstration of Snap-on strength against challenge. And it all reflects your extraordinary effort to make it sold. For your contributions to the results, you have my congratulations. For the special capabilities you bring to bear on behalf of our team every day, you have my admiration. And for the unshakable belief you consistently display in our future, you have my thanks. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Scott Stember with Roth MKM. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Scott. Scott Stember : Nick, it sounds like within tools that power tools was the weakest. Could you maybe quantify that how much? And maybe just talk about how the other sub-segments like tool storage, diagnostics and hand tools it? Nick Pinchuk : Power tools was down. The most interesting thing, power tools, I hate to say tough comparison. They did have a difficult comparison year-over-year. Last year was one of the bigger quarters. It actually was up sequentially. So we saw some movement there and the pivot towards shorter payback items versus where we were in the fourth quarter. I think that was certainly down the biggest and as I think Aldo said, it was down double digits. Diagnostics was down, but the \u2013 one of the things that that did help the profitability was the fact that tool storage was up and hand tools wasn\u2019t as afflicted as the others. And so therefore, what the Tools Group actually makes, remember that in the array of products, the Tools Group for tool storage and hand tools get both distribution and manufacturer\u2019s margin. So that really is what describes the product of array. It was kind of \u2013 when we look at it, we can see the effects of pivoting. Tool storage was up, but it was in what we would call the lower end. We\u2019re kind of pleased with it because we worked hard on the Algona plant, trying to do this pivot to get more capacity in the accessory and in the classic line in the carts and the accessories in the classic had big quarters, and those are the lower cost items, which people don\u2019t get as embroiled and longer payback. So we\u2019re kind of pleased with that. And hand tools, I showed you some of the arrays out of customer connection that we rolled out and we\u2019re rolling out more going forward. Scott Stember : So some of the two new power tools that you referred to you said help is on the way. When do you think we\u2019ll start seeing this? Is this starting to shift or the\u2026 Nick Pinchuk : We bought some of that in the quarter toward the end of the quarter. The way the two played out, things got better. I think sales up through demand got better as the quarter went on. So we kind of had some momentum. I hate to overplay that because I\u2019ve seen \u2013 I\u2019ve been here a while. I see all kinds of calibrations from quarter-to-quarter. The end did have Easter this year, still it looked pretty good. So I think we\u2019re kind of encouraged by that. And what I meant by that was, I like those two that I brought out. We brought out other ones, and we have an array of new ones coming out in the second quarter around power tools. So I think what I meant there is help is on the way as we had \u2013 we introduced in the quarter, a couple of things plus others, because those two I mentioned, plus we\u2019ve got others coming. Scott Stember : Got it. And just last question. If you were to take out the intercompany pressure in RS&I and C&I, what were the external sales? How did they do in both of those segments in the quarter? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Look, it\u2019s \u2013 if you look at it organically without currency and acquisitions, which would raise the numbers actually, with just apples-to-apples, C&I was up 2.2% externally. And I think RS&I was up almost 6%, 5.8%. So RS&I was pretty good right in our \u2013 right where we expect them to be all the time. So RS&I really had a pretty good quarter. And actually, given Europe, seven countries in recession and so you see this kind of thing. I think the hand tools business in Europe was kind of in defile. And so the other businesses went pretty well, so we\u2019re pretty pleased with those businesses. Scott Stember : Got it. That\u2019s all I have for now. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nick, nice descriptions on the NPIs. I was actually lagging a bit because had that issue with the \u2013 I think, the caliper pins on my Sequoia last time I fixed the break. So I don\u2019t think the Sequoia was on your list, but you can add it. Nick Pinchuk : [Indiscernible] things that sell. When we talk about short payback items, these guys can see the tool and say, hey, I\u2019ve spent a dog\u2019s age fixing these things and this helps. So I think it works out okay for us. Yes. Christopher Glynn : I was wondering if you could contrast, share some thoughts on the kind of decent strength from repair shops with an auto repair umbrella versus the technicians having some confidence? Nick Pinchuk : Look, we've seen it before. We actually saw in the financial recession, the Great Financial Recession back what, more than 10 years ago. And the COVID is the COVID that the shops weren't down that much. They were down for a few weeks and then they figure out what to do, and they were humming in both situations. But the technicians were confidence poor; they didn't know where the world was going. So if you remember, I think it's approximately in the beginning of the COVID, we had the recoveries coming out when we had that V-shaped recovery in the third and fourth quarter, that was driven a lot by handfuls. Small payback and small payback items, short payback items. And so that's what they do. They kind of say, I don't know \u2013 it's very interesting. Financial economy, we have all these calculations. The people have worked think they get up every morning and they see the news for breakfast. And enough of it is bad, they start to lose confidence. And so that's what they're saying. They're saying \u2013 they're thinking, geez, I don't know, where are these wars are going to go? They're going to start raising taxes, our kids going to have to fight. The border seems to be a migration, all those things, and they start saying, \"Well, I'm not \u2013 I know I'm doing good now. But I'm not sure what's going to happen in the future. They don't think in terms of soft landing, hard landing. I'm not sure what's going to happen in the future. So they don't want to get them ourselves out in traffic. Sometimes the narrative about everyday working people is that they're propagating and borrow in bad times. That's not been my experience. These people are pretty much. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And sticking with those techs, so maybe we're seeing the lag effect of inflation and rates a bit here on small private operators and you're focused on pivoting the focus to match the faster payback. Should we basically figure you need a couple of quarters to align that as you or the organizational. Nick Pinchuk : I don't know. Certainly, I'm tasking the Tools Group to do it at light speed, and we are working on it with alacrity it is an unknowable amount because what happens is as you move your capacity around in the factors actually refocus your capacity, no matter how much you start putting that thing, you start \u2013 you start sticking yourself back, you set up more cash to deliver. And sometimes that can be a problem. We despite the number, the number was worse from a, I think, a little bit in the quarter, but we saw progress there. We saw the characteristic shifting. And so we think that's going to work for us because we've seen it work before. I don't know how long that will take. Certainly, we expected to see improvement as we go forward. What the rates of that improvement are, I cannot tell. Christopher Glynn : Makes sense. Thank you, Nick. Operator : The next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes, good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : Hey David. David MacGregor : Good morning, Nick. I guess based on our work, we expected the weaker confidence in technicians, but we also know you were more promotional than normal in the first quarter with the regional kickoffs and the follow-ons. And clearly, franchisees were not responding to those elevated promotional levels to the extent we thought. I guess going forward, do you raise further the promotional discounts and incentives \u2013 can you restore growth in the Tools segment in 2024? Or are we looking at the segment continuing at a negative mid-single-digit pace through the balance of the year. It sounded like your answer to the last question was kind of a more passive approach where you just have to wait and see how things play out as opposed to maybe taking more active initiatives? Nick Pinchuk : I don't know if I accept your first premise that we were more pragmatic in our promotions in the first quarter than usual. I don't know that to be true. David, though, I'm not reviewing every promotion all the time either. So I couldn't sit here and review them at all. I don't think so though. I don't think \u2013 our view is like this. The real solution to it is, is the pivot. And the more of these small products, these short payback products, and they're profitable, that we get out, the more sales we'll have, I think trying to promote against the wins like corn water up a rope. And so we're not going to do that. We're not going to do that. I'm not that desperate \u2013 you know what I mean? I mean, look, this is a quarter, okay. The quarter is substandard, but we expect improvement. And oh, by the way, I think our margins are still enviable. So I'm not going to \u2013 we're not going to go \u2013 I'm not saying we won't have good promotions. That's not what I'm saying. But I'm saying we're not going to get our hair on fire on this in the promotion line. We will get our hair on fire and trying to pivot designing short payback items, altering the capacity in the factory and having our people in sales work more on \u2013 put more energy into getting our franchisees, how are you going to sell these shorter payback items. Sure. If somebody wants to buy an epic we'll be happy to comment them. But that's what I'm talking about here. I don't think we're going to be promoted any more than normal, any different than normal. Let's put it that way except maybe to focus promotions on maybe some short payback items to try to give people some energy around it. Promotions aren't actually say, but promotions aren't necessarily cost reductions, although they appear to be sometimes price reduction, sometimes it's just about creating energy and focus. David MacGregor : I'm pretty certain that your post regional kickoff promotions were up year-over-year versus last year. But I can follow up with you offline on that. Nick Pinchuk : I'm not saying it wrong, David. I'm just saying I'm not aware \u2013 I don't feel like we are frenetic about it. That's all. I don't talk to the wrong guy, if you think I'm following every promotion. I don't. But the envelope, I kind of described to you, we expect to follow. David MacGregor : Yes. Just a couple of follow-up questions, Nick. Can you talk about the progress you made this quarter with the incremental manufacturing capacity and maybe the extent to which that increased ability to ship provided a partial offset to the negative top line? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I don\u2019t know about the volumes, but we certainly got out what we \u2013 I liked what happened in Algona, David, the full storage plan. It seemed as though Algona, which had been pounding away on it for a long time as I know you\u2019re very well aware, had made pretty good progress. I think we\u2019re a little behind that in, say, like Elizabethton and [indiscernible] certainly Milwaukee in terms of the handful plant. It may be a little more difficult to create the changes and create the pivot. So I was pleased with what happened. And I don\u2019t know, though not so much liquidation. I don\u2019t think there was that much of that. I think that would have been helped in the fourth quarter some too. So I don\u2019t know. Not really a big factor in the situation. David MacGregor : Okay. This last quarter, you had some inventory putback from franchisee attrition that contributed to the negative growth. Was franchisee attrition up again this quarter? And was the inventory put back again to source of negative growth? Nick Pinchuk : I would say there was inventory put back. But maybe a little bit less than about the same, I suppose, is the fourth quarter, maybe not quite the same. So we didn\u2019t see quite because what happens is I think the phenomenon there, Dave, is David, is that remember, I said that everybody was like they were white hot coming out of the SFC and then all of a sudden, everybody is starting to get a little nervous and that caused a little more put back. I don\u2019t think we had that transition piece in this period. So that probably ended up not having as much put back. David MacGregor : Okay. And the last question for me, just on credit. I guess I\u2019m trying to make sense of the flat originations, given the \u2013 it sounds like the Diagnostics business, in particular, might be pretty weak. How much of that would you think was just kind of revolving account transfers and what\u2019s changing in terms of these? Nick Pinchuk : I don\u2019t think much \u2013 I don\u2019t think\u2026 David MacGregor : Not much? Nick Pinchuk : We will watch that. I\u2019m pretty sure I know that didn\u2019t change. Aldo Pagliari : It\u2019s actually lower and lower. David MacGregor : Okay. Nick Pinchuk : Not really impacted. David MacGregor : It\u2019s down, okay, down. What\u2019s changing in terms of the EC approval rates? And I guess you mentioned EC, your originations were down low single digits. I\u2019m just guessing overall credit penetration rates are directionally lower. Can you just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing in credit trends? Your provisioning was up $4 million. Aldo Pagliari : I don\u2019t think the penetration rates are dipping at all. I think what Nick has described as lower sales of big ticket items. And if there\u2019s lower big ticket items, then there\u2019s lower EC originations, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything dramatic in terms of a shift of any sort in terms of how the Snap-on Credit is participating in the sales of the Tools Group. Nick Pinchuk : If it helps, David, remember the small \u2013 faster payback items. So in diagnostics, diagnostics was down, but the smaller and SOLUS+ was strong in the quarter, and that doesn\u2019t get EC as much as, say, Snap-on ZEUS [ph]. So some of that\u2019s in that situation. But not really much change. I do that, EC doesn\u2019t necessarily follow directly to the activity. Okay. David MacGregor : Right. Good. Thanks very much gentlemen. Operator : The next question is from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Hi and good morning all. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Gary. Gary Prestopino : Nick, can you maybe \u2013 could you maybe just help me out here? I mean, the market for repair \u2013 auto repairs is very strong. Sometimes takes longer than you would expect to get your car repaired, even on the collision side. Nick Pinchuk : I agree. Gary Prestopino : But yet you\u2019re saying your power tools are down and diagnostics down. Don\u2019t the technicians really need to have these products in order to do their jobs correctly and efficiently and quickly. So I guess what I\u2019m asking is, is this just really a function of maybe what\u2019s going on with the Tools Group is that your diagnostic products have kind of permeated the channel, and there\u2019s not a lack of demand that is maybe being driven by the fact that everybody\u2019s needs have been taken care of. And then on the other side, the power tools, maybe there\u2019s just hasn\u2019t been the opportunity to innovate as much as you had maybe last year to drive growth? I\u2019m just trying to square all this together. Nick Pinchuk : Look, I think the thing is you could, in diagnostics, we did sell the quicker payback items, the SOLUS+. It was the big ticket ones like ZEUS which is quite a bit more expensive that didn\u2019t sell. In power tools, yes, it can be \u2013 it can follow very strongly what\u2019s introduced in a certain period. At time, the power tools, I think, looks worse than it is, like I said, it was up sequentially with some reasonable gains. So I think we see progress in the power tools. So I do think \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing that. We\u2019ve seen it before where technicians will focus on things they have an array of things they want to buy from Snap-on. And often, when they\u2019re confronted with this, they make a transition to say, well, where \u2013 how can I \u2013 I want to see the world play out a little bit more. I\u2019ll buy this wrench or I\u2019ll buy this smaller box or I\u2019ll buy a small diagnostic or I\u2019ll maybe hold on to my power tool a little bit longer. People need the products, but on the other hand, it is an imprecise thing. Sometimes they\u2019ll say, okay, I need a particular power tool or a diagnostics because I had trouble last week on this particular on some Toyota or maybe on a BMW. And they'll say, \"Well, I'll wait a little while because I won't see another BMW for a month or two or a quarter three or four months. You'll see that it's an imprecise situation. Simply, our view of it is more \u2013 it's always influenced by product, about the new stuff that rolls out, it's a complex array. But what's happening, at least as far as we can report and I've talked to a lot of guys is that technicians \u2013 one guy in Northern California said the techs are scared. Another guy talked to in Kentucky \u2013 [indiscernible], Kentucky said they're getting involved in the everyday news. It's weighing them down. I got another guy in Nevada and Reno, we said, they're assessing over the election. So I'm telling you, this is kind of a \u2013 it's sort of saying, where is the environment going to go? I'm going to keep my powder dry for a while. I'm going to just take it bit-by-bit, I don't want to take a big bite \u2013 so when they want to figure out how to repair cars, they don't take a big bite. Gary Prestopino : All right. And then I guess the last \u2013 you had mentioned that this had happened before, I think, in The Great Recession. Nick Pinchuk : And in the COVID \u2013 Gary and in the COVID. Gary Prestopino : So how long did this take to flesh out? Was this a couple of quarter phenomenon? Nick Pinchuk : In the COVID, I would say it took three quarters, maybe two quarters for people to get used, and basically that was driven more by the \u2013 we're talking about attitude. It took about two quarters, maybe 2.5 quarters for them to say, \"Oh, the all clear is blowing\". Nothing is really going to happen. We're out of the COVID and the great financial recession is a little longer. But it all depends on how use they get to it. Now we help this by pivoting. Remember that in this situation, we help by giving them more small bites. So some of this has to do with matching the product \u2013 the new product available that's analyzing them with stuffs they're willing to take on, and that's what we're doing. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Yes. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Certainly. Operator : The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. Pleaser go ahead. Nick Pinchuk : Hey Luke. Luke Junk : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just pivoting on that last point there, Nick, just trying to get a feel for your gut of how much you think is under your control as you make this pivot and like you said, just matching new products with where the demand is right now in terms of I guess I'd be interested to get your perspective on the last six months. Just how much that feedback has changed of what mechanics want? And to what extent are the franchisees able to kind of give you demand clues or is it more about kind of pushing the right products to the franchisees and helping to market the products? Nick Pinchuk : No. No. No. Demand clues. I mean, fundamentally, it's on a macro basis, Luke, I don't know if it's six months. So this sort of started sometime in October. I don't know how long it is. But the thing is, is that it's pretty much about what people will say, if I buy this now, I can get a payback now, and I don't get committed for longer terms. So I'm not \u2013 that's a description in general. Of course, everything I'd say about the technicians probably doesn't apply to every technician and every garage is probably a great landscape for this. But that's simply what we're doing. And so we're getting feedback from the franchisees on this and we're doing a lot of customer connection on it. I'm talking to franchisees all the time. We'll have the NFAC in here in about four weeks. I'll talk to them about it. We're making a lot of cost. So we're getting feedback from those guys, and we have pretty good feedback right now. We know where we're trying to go. And so that we believe that will work for us. Of course, it all won't work but once we execute on that, then we'll iterate to hone in. Now how long that takes. And as I said before, I think our view is our standard is to keep improving I'm not so sure how quickly. But I do think we have the capacity to do it, and we've done it before. Luke Junk : And then maybe a question on RS&I if I can sneak it in, just the expanded opportunity right now seeing with OEM dealerships, especially kind of new technologies and new things coming into the market. Just that seems more of a secular opportunity. I mean, do you see the opportunity is any different versus this business historically either in kind of the scope of the opportunity or even the margin opportunity maybe? Nick Pinchuk : Look, I think three things about RS&I. One is that you've got \u2013 you've got the opportunity associated with the number of new models people are launched. And I thought a slant guy on TV about a month ago, he was talked about 30 new models. I don't know how we're going to get all of those. But every time a new model comes out, this is a good business for us. And every time they have a warranty kind of recall and stuff like that, and that business has been pretty good now for some time. It was up nicely in the quarter, double digits, and the profitability is strong now, so that's a good bit. And so that's a unique at this point, and I think it will keep going as the technologies keep changing. Then you see the equipment business. The equipment business wasn't \u2013 it was off, but it wasn't as strongly up because Europe was pummeled by the equipment business. Those recessionary businesses in Europe. I mean, Germany being a recession was a big blow for us in this situation. And so that was harder. That will come back. But it does have the collision business and the equipment business in North America, all of which are booming. And those are nice margins. The margin was up in that business. So that's fueling some of it. And then our software keeps doing pretty well. We talked about the heavy-duty software. And we did have this legal benefit, which was in this ore, and it confirms the proprietary nature of our database. So I think that's \u2013 all those things are better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. Luke Junk : I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. Operator : The next question is from Sherif El-Sabbahy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Sherif El-Sabbahy: Hey, good morning. Nick Pinchuk : Sherif, how are you? Sherif El-Sabbahy: Doing well. Thanks. And thanks for all the great color you provided. I just had one small specific question. Just within power tools, are there any specific markets or end users that saw an outsized pullback or drove the decline year-over-year? Nick Pinchuk : Say that again, please. Sorry. Sherif El-Sabbahy: Are there any specific markets or end uses for power tools that saw an outsized pullback or stood out when you were kind of looking at the numbers? Nick Pinchuk : No, I don't think so. I think there is a constant movement between pneumatic and cordless in the power tools or a lot of people are converting to cordless. Not everything can be converted to cordless because people want to have continuous power and of course, the pneumatic will keep going. So if you're doing something over and over, sometimes people prefer pneumatic guns, because they don't run out of battery and they're lighter and all that stuff. So if you have a repetitive situations. But there's a general motion to cordless \u2013 we haven't seen any \u2013 if you look at the nature of the product line, products and power tools, what you see is sales that follow introduction of new products. Every time we bring out a new product, that tends to raise that particular category. I haven't seen much of a particular pullback. I think the need for power tools in industrial settings in critical industry settings remains moving at pace in the garage is less so because of the aforementioned uncertainty. That's all. That's the only color I can add in that situation. Sherif El-Sabbahy: Thank you. Appreciated it. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey good morning guys. Don't think we've touched on the sell-in versus sell-out on the U.S. franchise tools. Do you have any color as far as what their POS looked like versus their take rate? Nick Pinchuk : I'm not sure what you mean by point of sale. Okay. Yes. Look, sell off the van was better than our sell to the van this quarter particularly towards the end. So that's \u2013 we sold \u2013 our franchisees sold more of their vans than they bought in this situation \u2013 and that gap expanded a little bit as we went forward in the quarter. Bret Jordan : And I guess the sellout rate, how do you think that compares to the general market growth rate. I guess, do you think you're keeping up from a market share standpoint? Or is there any \u2013 shift there? Nick Pinchuk : No. I don't know, you may have a better view. Look, if you talked \u2013 I just talked \u2013 I talked \u2013 we talked to 36 franchisees and none of them mentioned I'm losing share. Nobody mentioned I'm losing share. So I don't think that's happening. And although these are windshield surveys and not based on data. But they don't seem to be in that situation. They can say, their view is, well, tougher to sell because people aren't buying, I don't have the big ticket items I used to sell and that carves down my product line that I can get to people to move on. Bret Jordan : Okay. There seem there will be a little gap between \u2013 with the Matco numbers at the end of last year. So we're not commenting about Matco becoming more aggressive as far as pushing their volume. Nick Pinchuk : Nobody's saying that I don't know. The Matco guys are smart guys. They may be able to \u2013 they may have some magic at, we don't know. But every place, it's hard to \u2013 what we found is we never really paid too much view of that over one quarter, those things go up and down. So I don't know. I can't really comment on their business, but I'm not hearing anything from our franchisees that would indicate that's a problem for us. Generally, we think that we sell to different people anyway. Bret Jordan : All right. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today which can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our second quarter and I'll provide my perspectives on the results on our markets and our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. Our second quarter -- of course, there were challenges uncertainty remain prominent among our technician customers but our Repair Systems & Information, or RS&I Group, with repair shop owners and managers and our commercial and industrial or C&I group, enabling critical tasks outside the vehicle shop. They both progressed very nicely, taking full advantage of their opportunities and balancing the tech turbulence and tools. So our results in the second quarter are clear and unmistakable demonstration that Snap-on's principal value creating mechanism, observing work right in the workplace, using the insights learned to create products that make critical tests easier and more efficient, that works across many industries and in many environments. It highlights that our enterprise is not dependent on a particular customer base. We believe, it shows that as we move forward, reaching higher we do so with greater resilience and with expanding possibilities and with an enterprise that's broader and stronger than ever before. Like most quarters, we did have headwinds, we had opportunities with disparities from group to group and geography to geography. North America remained mixed with significant gains in critical industries. Internationally, our consolidated results were varied but reflected overall positive. Europe showed some signs of recovery among the scattered economic disruptions from region to region and the Asia Pacific markets registered progress overcoming the delayed recovery in China. So now, let's talk about the results. Second quarter sales of $1179.4 million was slightly down from the $1191.3 million of last year. on an organic basis, excluding $5.7 million in unfavorable foreign currency and $7.3 million from acquisitions, our sales were lower by 1.1%. The OpCo operating income or OI margin for the full quarter was 23.8%, up 50 basis points. Now with that said, that level included the benefit of a final payment from our recent legal win, excluding that addition, the OI margin was 22.8%, down from 2023 but still among our very best to pass the only by the recent -- by the record-setting second quarter of last year. For financial services, the OI grew to $70.2 million from the $66.9 million recorded in 2023. A number that when combined with our OpCo results, raised the consolidated OI margin to 27.4%, up 60 basis points over the 26.8% of 2023 and EPS, it was $5.07 which included a benefit from the legal payment of $0.16. Again, excluding that legal item, EPS was $4.91 still above last year and representing a new Snap-on level for any quarter, strength and progress against the wind. So those are the overall numbers. Now for a view of the market. The second quarter once again highlighted that the opportunities in automotive repair, they continue to be favorable, marked by the ever-expanding complexity of design, new and diverse powertrains. More interlocking systems to advance driving autonomy, arrays of drive by wire sensors, new body materials and an aging car park now averaging 12.6 years. The opportunity in vehicle repair exists industry-wide and they appear to be unwavering. The vehicle OEMs, the dealerships and the independent shops recognizes the positive trend and they continue to invest in tools and equipment that will expand their capabilities to support the influx of new models and the ever rising complexity of repair. And in the quarter, our RS&I Group expanded our reach into OEM dealership -- into OEM dealership programs and strengthened our position in independent garages with our repair management software packages and with great new hardware products. So the possibility, with repair shop owners and managers are strong, the outlook looking forward is quite positive and Snap-on is well positioned to seize the opportunities. Now let's shift to the technicians. These are the folks who turn the wrenches to make the diagnosis and execute the repairs. Again this quarter, I had multiple occasions to meet with the franchisees, the garage owners and the tech and it reconfirmed that the shops and the technicians are prospering. The micro data says it's true, repair hours are up. Tech wages are healthy. The demand for tech is strong and the number of techs are increasing. The number of tech is increasing. It makes sense, new systems, the rising complexity, the aging car park makes what the techs do more difficult and more valuable. So the economic trajectory of vehicle repair is quite positive. It's an attractive place to be. But it's also clear that while the techs are busy and have cash, their confidence in the way forward is still poor. Every day there is bad news. Two wars with no end in sight, the border unsettled, the shipping lanes disrupted, tit-for-tat with China, lingering inflation and the election, the election seems to get more unpredictable with every morning news cycle; the hits just keep on coming for bad news for breakfast. It's almost like the grassroots technicians have a fear of what may happen. And paraphrasing the movie Dune fear is the outlook killer. The franchisees also confirmed to us that with general uncertainty, the techs are leaning toward purchases that provide quick paybacks, while making the work easier right away. They're kind of cool on longer-term bigger ticket items. And knowing that, the Tools Group continues to focus on near-term product development, manufacturing changes and selling efforts that match those preferences. So now let's talk about the critical industries, where Snap-on rolls out of the garage, solving tasks of significant consequence. This is where the C&I group operates. And it's our most significant international presence. The area where we're most subject to global headwinds but the news was still reasonably encouraging. For the sectors, the critical industries kept rising in the period, the military, aviation and education segments led the way. For geographies, Europe was mixed. Several countries in recession and the ongoing impacts of the Ukraine war. Asia Pacific will also remain mixed. China was weak, driven by delayed financial recovery and Southeast Asia, again, had its difficulties. But -- both regions for C&I and for the corporation in total, were positive in the quarter despite the variations. Now speaking more - now I'd like to speak more about the critical industries, the demand for customized solutions to drive reliability and productivity keeps rising. And C&I continues to show significant and broader advantage in that arena and we believe there's more coming. So that's the market, vehicle tech, cash-rich but confidence poor. Preferring quick payback products. Repair shop owners and managers moving upward to match the car park and the critical industry is booming outside the garage. In C&I, so let's cover the groups now. In C&I, sales were $372 million representing an organic sales gain of 1.2%, excluding $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales and $3.8 million of an unfavorable foreign currency. Higher activity with customers based in those critical industries and the gains in Asia -- and a gain in Asia that defies the turbulence more than offset declines in our power tool and European-based hand tool operations. From an earnings perspective, C&I OI of $62.2 million, improved $4.1 million or 7.1% above last year. And the OI margin, it was 16.7%, up 70 basis points representing a new record for that group; gangbusters -- gangbusters for those guys. And the big driver was our International division. Continuing its upward trajectory with a double-digit rise and very strong profitability. About 18 months ago, we expanded our capability to make [Indiscernible] easier outside the garage by adding another building for industrial custom kitting, serving a range of critical segments and it's paid off -- it's paid off big. Since then, that business has been on a tear, [Indiscernible] cranking out more and more bespoke product bundles, sophisticated solutions like our automated tool control units that have become the standard for a range of industries. Custom kit offerings aimed at specific applications and at making the critical work easier and more reliable. It's driven some nice gains all around the world. And we believe we see many more possibilities in that arena. So we continue to invest in critical industries, expanding capabilities like in our custom tool machine in Kenosha, producing low volume, high reward items, for the most essential tasks. For example, visiting an oil drilling site. We saw that adding a section of pipe on the rigs requires technicians to move around the circumference constantly repositioning the turning tool. It's a slow and clumsy and imprecise effort. Our custom team tackled the problem designing both, a new bespoke \u2013 both a new bespoke wrench -- both designing a new bespoke wrench, specifically for the task and enabled by our new Kenosha machine shop configured a special machining process to produce it and it all worked. The special oil rig pipe wrench, greatly reduced the rework associated with misalignment and substantially decreased the task time, getting the job done more efficiently and more reliably and along the way, expanding the Snap-on reputation in the critical oil and gas sector. Also in the quarter, we introduced a new line of 14.4-volt micropower drills aimed specifically at diverse applications in aviation and general manufacturing. Test in all sectors vary from inserting wood screws to drilling accurate holes in airframe, to high volumes on production lines. To span the variety, each tool in the new line, and there is a range of them, is set to a different RPM range, enabling the tech to fit the speed to the job, substantially reducing rework or irreversible damages -- damage. The drill -- it's also designed for 2 operating states, the first slower. Allowing the tools to bite into the materials, securing a position for the serious drilling and the second stage, performing that serious drilling at the predetermined RPM, making a quick and clear cut. Our new industrial micro drills, 2-stage design, matched to the task, bringing new levels with accuracy, consistency and reliability to the work, it's a superior tool for the very task of those sectors and the customers have noticed. C&I in the quarter, launching customized solutions, maintaining its strong momentum in the critical industry, extending out of the garage and reaching new heights in profitability. Now for the Tools Group. Sales in the second quarter are $482 million included an organic decrease of 7.7%. The group's OI margin in the period was 23.8%, down 250 basis points due to the lower volumes. But gross margins held down 20 basis points, almost flat. The benefits of new product, manufacturing efficiencies and rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, is written all over those numbers. And during the quarter, we continue to focus our product development, redirect our plans and guide our selling programs toward innovative quick payback solutions that drive productivity. A cornerstone for the pivot is rooted in customer - in our customer connection, standing side-by-side with the technicians, observing the work, witnessing the difficulties of modern and complex repair and using the insights gained to create a tool that makes especially difficult tasks much easier. In the second quarter, those insights lead the Tool Group to design a new torque adapter for use on Ford E-Series commercial vans. The standard procedure for basic brake repair on that model, requires the rear caliper bolts to be torqued at over 160-foot pounds, not so easy. And the task made doubly difficult because the bolt is obstructed, making it impossible to access the area with standard tooling without removing auxiliary parts, a big [tie] (ph) meter. So we've specifically configured a 21-millimeter, 12.6 inch flat adapter with a half inch hex drive to make the work easier and to specification. The device nestles perfectly. Between the particular obstructions on the model, engaging the fastener, turning a time-consuming task into one of just seconds and freeing the tech up to tackle the next repair order. It's made in our Elizabethton, Tennessee plant and it brings great value to the techs working on the E-Series. And you know there's a lot of them. Another example is the still observed when we observed when removing a canister tap that houses the fuel filter on 4 Super Duty trucks. Access to the 32-millimeter hectare on top of cap is impeded by other components. Standard part or sockets are out. Seeing the problem. Our team created a special low-profile socket, tapered, gradually, just the slide into position under the blocking hoses and then using a standard ration and extension, easily removing the clamp of a tap [ph], complete the repair, a complicated [ph] -- and complete the repair, a complicated job made much easier. Produced in our Milwaukee plant, it's another quick buyback item that makes a substantial difference and the text a lot of it. A final example comes from observing technicians walking to and from the work piece; back and forth from their work to achieve standard flyers for basic test. A compact design seemed to be the solution. So we expanded our triple joint flyer line to develop a small 4.5-inch fire set with 3 models, a combination along those in a flank drive slip joint version for versatility and they were all pocket size to be always at the ready, call it out of your pocket and you're ready to go. And all designed to allow immediate access to remove low torque in place to pull through users, to adjust hoses or provide some additional gripping leverage for basic repairs or just inspections. The new units save steps and make work easier in tight spaces and they're offered in 2 handle models. A cushion grip addition to reduce hand fatigue and for the first time, our bare metal diamond plate texture that provides a superior grid even with sweaty or oily hands. Cold forge in the U.S., the new pliers a game changer. And the rollout was a huge hit, making our million-dollar hit product status just during the initial launch. Well, that's the Tools Group. Pivoting to technicians preferences, producing innovative, quick paybacks, making work easier, New tools matched to the task and guided by customer connection, bringing quick value to the text and you can see the value play out in the gross margins, bringing quick value to the tech. And you can see that play out in the gross margins, almost flat in the downturn. You can also see, I think, our unwavering support for the franchisees and the operating expense. It was about flat even in the turbulence, even in the downturn, even with the lower sales. We'll maintain our training, our programs and our efforts in the field. Even in this turbulence. You see, we believe the uncertainty will recede and we want the network to be strong and fully loaded when that occurs. Now for RS&I. Group sales of $458.8 million in the quarter, representing a $4.3 million or 1% organic increase that was partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. Those gains reflected higher activity with OEM dealerships attenuated by lower sales in the diagnostics division, BOI margin, it was an even 25%, rising 60 basis points and among the group's best. The numbers reflect the strength of RS&I products and programs for repair shareholders and managers as we help them match the evolving challenges of [indiscernible] car park. Speaking of the product evolutions and our progress with OEM pores. The traditional method of lifting vehicles is becoming more complex with the onset of new hybrid and EV platforms. The batteries require changes in lift points to adjust for the different center of gravity on EVs. And to complicate the matter. Each model design presents a different problem. In response, we designed steel floor plates matched to particular models that service guides and positioning the vehicle in the exact location that puts the lift arms in the proper place for that vehicle, enabling a safe procedure and an easy lift. The OEMs and the shops, they enthusiastically seen the innovation as another a long line of the modifications needed to match the evolving car park. They need to facilitate to match that change and we're helping them do it. Another successful [indiscernible] release was the ProX1HD [ph] on vehicle break plate [ph], specifically for heavy-duty platforms like buses, fire engine and semi-truck, delayed cuts away in perfections and abrasion on a brake rotor surface -- the imperfections and abrasions on a brake\u2019s rotor surface that always arise during regular operations. The result is a fully restored component that supports optimized brake performance without the need of a replacement. The previous choice for heavy-duty break repair work was the disassemble of break assembly or and either order new parts or smooth the rotor on a stand-alone bench lay [ph]; in either case, a laborious process. The new ProCut design avoids both the time and the effort to lift the heavy components off the vehicle and it eliminates the cost of new parts. We believe it's another changer. Garage owners have seen the value and we project that the ProCut will become the industry standard. Also in RS&I, C&I, a car aligner serves the vehicle collision market serves the vehicle collision market. Serves the vehicle fusion market with a number of heavy-duty items. A good example during the quarter is the release of our low profile frame bench innovatively designed holding the workpiece at an optimal height, making it easier for technicians to interact with the damaged vehicle. The bench is rugged for heavy collision work and integrates with our existing policy solutions that stretch and can torque the chassis back in position. The ability to raise and lower the benches in multiple positions while still engaging with the vehicle reduces fatigue with the user and makes the process much easier. The collision space is quite robust. By the changing vehicles. And Carline has been on -- and as such, Carline has been on a continuing positive trajectory. And the new bench makes our advantage of that market even stronger. RS&I expanding its res which shop owners and managers, confronting the increased complexity, focusing on developing innovations that simplify the difficult and help shops prosper along the way. Well, those are the -- for along the way. Well, those -- the RS&I quarter was quite strong. Well, those are the second quarter results, Tools Group down impacted by uncertainty, pivoting to customer preference, launching new product, holding the gross margins and maintaining the network. C&I and RS&I providing the multi-sector power of customer connection and new product recording strong profitability, balancing the headwinds of technician uncertainty and the overall corporation. Launching a broad range of products from tapered sockets to industrial power tools to collision benches, sales about flat, OI margin, 23.8% -- 22.8%, excluding the legal benefits, one of our highest and EPS $5.07, $4.91 excluding the legal item setting a new high. performance achieved against the wind. It was an encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1.1794 billion [ph] in the quarter compared to $1.1913 billion [ph] last year. Reflecting a 1.1% organic sales decline and $5.7 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales. Sales activity was similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, while our franchise van channel revenues continue to be dampened by afflicted technician confidence, our sales of repair shop owners and managers, again increased year-over-year. Encouragingly, activity with customers serving the critical industries remained robust. Consolidated gross margin of 50.6% compared to 50.7% last year, reflecting the lower sales volumes largely offset by savings from the company's RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales of 26.8% compared to 27.4% laser. In the quarter, as noted in our press release, operating expenses included an $11.2 million benefit for the final payments received associated with the legal matter. The 60 basis point improvement in the operating expense ratio is primarily due to the benefit from the legal payments, partially offset by the effects of lower sales volumes. Operating earnings before financial services of $280.3 million in the quarter included a benefit from the lead payments compared to $277 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 23.8%, including a 100 basis point benefit in the legal payments compared to 23.3% last year. Financial services revenue of $100.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $93.4 million last year, while operating earnings of $70.2 million compared to $66.9 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $350.5 million which includes a legal benefit compared to $343.9 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin of 27.4%, including the legal payments, compared to 26.8% in 2023. Our second quarter effective income tax rate of 22.6% compared to 22.9% last year. Net earnings of $271.2 million or $5.07 per diluted share, including an $8.7 million or $0.16 per diluted share after tax benefit from the legal payments compared to $264 million or $4.89 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2023. Now, let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with the C&I group on Slide 7. Sales of $372 million compared to $364.2 million last year, reflecting a 1.2% organic sales gain and $7.3 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $3.8 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic increase is primarily due to a double-digit gain in sales to customers in critical industries, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tools business and a double-digit reduction in the power tools operation, the latter mostly associated with lower intersegment sales. With respect to critical industries, defense-related sales are strong as it was activity in the aviation sector. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 41.7% in the second quarter from 39.5% in 2023. This was largely due to the increased sales volumes and the higher gross margin critical industry sector, savings from RCI initiatives and 50 basis points of benefit from acquisitions. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 150 basis points to 25% in the quarter from 23.5% in 2023, primarily due to investments in personnel and other costs and a 60 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $62.2 million compared to $58.1 million last year. The operating margin of 16.7% compared to 16% in 2023 and represented a new milestone of achievement for the segment. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $482 million compared to $543.1 million a year ago reflecting a 7.7% organic sales decline and $800,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. And now I guess with the last quarter, the organic decrease reflects a high single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit gain in our international operations. Gross margin of 48.8% in the quarter declined 20 basis points from 49% last year and that's primarily due to sales -- lower sales volumes. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose 230 basis points to 25% in the quarter from 22.7% in 2023, largely due to the effects of lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $114.8 million compared to $137.7 million last year, the operating margin of 23.8% compared to 26.3% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $454.8 million compared to $452 million in 2023, reflecting a 1% organic sales increase, partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes a high single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved 50 basis points to 45.5% from 45% last year. primarily due to savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 20.5% improve 10 basis points from 20.6% last year. And the operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $113.6 million compared to $110.4 million last year. The operating margin of 25% compared to 24.4% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $7.1 million or 7.6% to $100.5 million from $93.4 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial Services operating earnings of $70.2 million compared to $66.9 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $3.8 million from 2023 levels including $3.5 million of higher provisions for credit losses. Sequentially, the provision for credit losses was lower by $1.3 million. In the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, respective average yield on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.6%. In the second quarter of '24 and '23, the average yield on contract receivables were 8.9% and 8.6%, respectively. Total loan originations of $308. 1 million in the second quarter represented a decrease of $18.2 million or 5.6% and from 2023 levels, primarily reflecting a high single-digit decline in extended credit originations, partially offset by higher originations of contract receivables. Consistent with the sales activity in the Snap-on Tools Group, extended credit origination to the U.S. declined and were only partially offset by growth in originations internationally. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.6% is up 30 basis points from the second quarter of 2023 but down 20 basis points sequentially from the 1.8% reported last quarter. Turn 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $58.6 million represented 2.94% [ph] of outstandings at quarter-end. Considering the current environment, we believe the delinquency in portfolio performance metrics remain relatively stable and are consistent with pre-COVID experience. Now, turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $301.1 million in the quarter represented 108% of net earnings compared to $270.3 million last year. The increase as compared to the second quarter of 2023 largely reflects decreases in working investment and higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $60.2 million primarily reflected net additions to finance receivables of $41.2 million and capital expenditures of $23.2 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $127.9 million included cash dividends of $98 million and the repurchase of 174,000 shares of common stock for $47.4 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $271.1 million of common stock under our existing authorization. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivables decreased $7.8 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 60 days were unchanged from year-end. Inventories decreased $40.9 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.4 compared to 2.3 at year-end 2023. Our quarter end cash position of $1.2327 billion compared to $1.15 billion [ph] at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our second quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be in the range of $100 million to $110 million and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing out. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Wow! that's our second quarter. A period of continuing turbulence borne out of the uncertainty in the grassroots detect, uncertainty on the near-term environment. Customers tech that are cash rich and confidence poor. But it was also a period where our value-creating mechanism observing past right in the workplace, connecting with customers and translating the insights in an innovation that can make critical tasks easier where that core of our business model demonstrated that if efficacy stretches well beyond our traditional customer -- technician customer base and it does so quite profitably. It was an interlude in which our Snap-on value creation processes showed its ongoing strength, particularly visible in the Tools Group, where it drove product value and operating efficiency that buttressed [ph] gross margins, that stayed close to about flat despite the lower volumes. And you can see that written all across the quarter. The Tools Group, an uncertainty driven decline in volume continuing an -- and continuing and unreduced support for its franchise network but with profitable quick payback products on RCI [ph] keeping gross margins at reasonable levels, offsetting some of the volume impact. RS&I, seizing the opportunity to help shop owners and managers, matching the rising vehicle repair complexity and doing it very profitably, achieving an OI margin of 25% one of its best C&I rolling out of the garage to -- in critical industries overcoming the recessions in Europe and the turbulence to grow in each feeder [ph], continuing the upward trajectory of its customized kitting business driving expansion in critical industries and achieving an OI margin of 16.7%, up 70 basis points; its highest ever. And it all came together for a positive performance for the overall enterprise. Sales; about flat against the uncertainty. OI margins, 23.8% -- 22.8%, excluding the legal payment, one of our very strongest, and EPS $5.07 -- $4.91 without the legal payment, the highest for any Snap-on quarter. It was an encouraging period. And we believe that with the strength of our business model, with the opportunities inherent in our broad markets and with the considerable and harm experience of our team, Snap-on will remain resilient in the turbulence, making the most of it is the abundant possibility to markets and we'll continue to advance making progress through 2024 and well beyond. Now before I turn the call over to the operator, I'll speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know a lot of you are listening. The strength Snap-on has demonstrated in the turbulence and the associated advantages we carry into the days ahead have been created by all of you. the considerable capabilities you bring to bear every hour to have my admiration. For the significant success you've achieved in the quarter and for many periods before, you have my congratulations. And for the unwavering belief you hold in the future of our team, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Luke Junk with Baird. Luke Junk : To start with, just hoping we could get an update on the facility expansion projects that you have going on right now, both kind of progress incrementally timing and then how things are progressing versus your expectations? And to what extent you can leverage that to pivot the mix and really focus on those quicker payback items that folks are looking for? Nick Pinchuk : [Indiscernible] is concerning what the... Luke Junk : Facility expansions -- I think -- both, Milwaukee -- yes [ph]. Nick Pinchuk : Okay. It's only expansion, I can talk about that. Look, Algona added some space that's in place. They're starting to use it now. Now the thing is you use it but you figure out how to be more efficient. So just because it's in place and you're in the saddle doesn't mean it's going to work at high efficiency. But that's breaking some bottlenecks out there and allowing us to build things like we're bringing on a new workbench. We're bringing out a 36-inch small Epic toolbox that's smaller than we ever saw before -- than we've had before and therefore, it's a lower price situation. In other words, quicker payback items. So that's working in Milwaukee. We're expanding 25% and we've got -- we've expanded the machining area. Some of the machines are in. We're still delivering others because they were ordered, frankly, to adjust to a pivot. So we've had partial expansion of some of our flexible socket impact line and also some of our bit line. And we -- so that will be sort of developing through the expanding and getting better and bigger during the quarter. And as we move out, we'll get more and more efficient. And then we're building probably for the fourth quarter and first quarter, we're building the more capacity into the plating line up there because we expand in Elizabeth on another hand, that's where we make the wrenches [indiscernible]. We've expanded the plating line already there and that's up and operating and we're putting more machines in there to fill another expansion to build more effective ranches using cold forming to reduce the near net ship and making -- raising our capacity for those -- for ratchets in that situation. And we're expanding our adjustable rent capacity down there because it's in demand and we can't build enough of them. So you have to -- that will give you some examples, I think, in terms of outgoing -- and it's I think it increases by about 25%. In Milwaukee increased by 25%, Alcon's 30%, and Elizabeth -- will be 35% at the end. So -- and then, so they're all in place. Some of it is working, some isn't. But what it has done is it broken some of the difficult workarounds we've had in the places. So part of the things you see in gross margin in some of the efficiencies that are coming out of the already partial expansions being completed and up and running. Luke Junk : That's very helpful. Could you maybe comment on tool storage, specifically in the quarter [ph] the benefit, I think, already in the first quarter of you having the capacity in place and flexing it like you just spoke to, did the growth continue in the second quarter? Nick Pinchuk : The product line -- every product line in this quarter was more balanced. Every product line was down some in the quarter. And big ticket, you saw the originations. I think originations were down more originations which is a surrogate for big tool -- for big ticket sales and longer payback sales was down more than the Tools Group was down in the quarter. So the big scans were a smaller percentage of that. Now that was led, Diagnostics was probably the big player in that because diagnostics was comparing to a launch of the SOLUS+ last year. So a non-launch quarter you can have different comparisons with that in this quarter like this with the launch quarter. But generally, tool storage, if you're talking about the efficacy of tool storage, One of the things this is doing is allowing us to sell and pivot to provide people the accessories, the benches, the cards that technicians are more receptive to in this situation. So that will accrue to us. It's a question of how quickly we can get that burned in to the Algona production process. It's working a little bit now. But in the quarter, technician uncertainty, I think, was a little higher this quarter. So you probably like you might see the conditions are a little more uncertain. And so I think the ticket was down again. Luke Junk : And then lastly, just given the uncertainty in terms of tax right now, do you meter or change your approach to the SFC all this year just in terms of promotions and positioning and could it be maybe a venue to refine your approach in this more unsettled environment kind of exiting this year into '25 [ph]? Nick Pinchuk : Yes, yes. I mean, the thing -- the -- look, not the overall thing. The overall thing is the SFC is 3 purposes. Before. One is we have a training seminar, -- we're going to train the heck out of things, things we think need train -- some of those are smaller ticket diagnostic units, some of them are handles and so on. So we're working on those things in the SFC. We're going to continue that because we're going to continue to support. Like I said, we want to be a full sprint on fully loaded when we come out of this difficulty with the Tools Group and our network. And then we have kind of a tool show which is several football fields and you want to let the people touch the tools and that's where we'll have some change because we'll be trying to emphasize the quicker payback items which we think that technicians want. For example, one of the warm-up promotions for the SFC was the Super 7 which is filled with the hand tools, wrenches and ratchets and hammers and torque units. And it did go pretty well. It did get subscribed almost as a sellout. So we're going to try to push in that situation. So we'll be trying to emphasize by physical presentation and by verbal urging the idea of quicker payback items, not completely neglecting tools further diagnostics in that situation. And then -- the other thing about the SFC, you need the SFC, I think, because you don't touch your franchisees that often and we all want to give them a message and reinforce that they have listed their economic future with a strong and robust business called [indiscernible]. Operator : And our next question will come from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Patrick Buckley : This is Patrick Buckley on for Brett. On the RS&I, could you talk a bit more on the dispersion between the OEM dealer customers and the independents. Is that independent shop softness similar to what you're seeing in the Tools Group? Just more cautious given the backdrop? Or is there something else there? Nick Pinchuk : Well, remember that that's characterization. We are strong in the dealerships because the OEM programs have been strong, the change the idea -- that was the purpose of the Lyft discussion with is that really the OEMs are coloring up or are raising their game to match the different drivetrains and the more autonomy and the OEMs are launching programs to do that. and either associated with new models and new capabilities like demonstrated in Lyft. So you see that and that is marking. That business grew again high single digits in the quarter. So that is Boeing is underpinning that. And also, it's around the -- some of the software in that business with our electronic parts catalog. Now if you pivot, it's a little more complicated situation with the independent because flowing through RS&I is the diagnostics. They have the Diagnostics division because of its dependence on the information basis which are integral to other RS&I products. So diagnostics like big ticket was down in the Tools Group. So that dragged down some of the RS&I volume. If you look at our RS&I C&I, both sell to power tools and C&I diagnostics and ours. And if you look at them, they were up, I think the number was 1% organically at RS&I 1.2% organically in C&I. But if you looked at it externally, excluding sales to the Tools Group, internal sales, C&I was up 3.9% organically. And RS&I was up over 4%. And so it's a little more complicated description of that. We described it that way based on the efficacy of the actual reported numbers. So we do see some progress in independent shops, particularly with our direct sales businesses. You see one of the things that is happening in RS&I and coming out in RS&I is that when we can get up and sell directly to the customer with our, I think, really strong product line and broad, we do pretty well. We're still doing pretty well. But a part of that business goes through distributors. And when they go through distributors, we're seeing a pull off of that business. We saw it particularly in some of the RS&I businesses. So I don't think it's the independent shops. I think it's the distributors themselves or maybe getting a little white knuckle at this time and maybe taking down some of their inventories, some of those distributors. So you're seeing that over here. It's kind of a complicated complicate around late summarized. We're doing pretty well with the dealerships. We're doing well selling to direct independent shops which means they're doing pretty well and they're doing -- they're still robust. But the intermediaries are a little bit more reluctant. Patrick Buckley : Got it. That's helpful. And then within the Tools Group, could you talk about how pricing compared to units during the quarter? Or maybe just additional color around how successful these lower payback items are and improving volumes and how that mix is affecting things? Nick Pinchuk : Well, the price per unit is a lot lower. So you've got to sell a lot more wrenches to make up for a tool storage box, that's pretty important. And that can weigh on your volume. But I would offer to you, you need to look no further than gross margin. Margin down 20 basis points with a -- what was it, 7.7% organic sales down, gross margin down 20 basis points -- how does you think that happened? Well, it happens because the new tools you bring out. The new ranches, the new tools we're bringing out, they are selling at good margins -- that doesn't mean we're pricing the existing businesses but a lot of these new tools and a lot of them are rolling out we got rent ships and ratchets and extensions and things that are especially made after the E-Series and the Super Duty trucks we talked about. People are willing to pay big premiums or that kind of stuff and it's playing out in the gross margins. part of the story about the Tools Group is, we held the margins pretty well and we kept spending at lower volumes. We didn't back off of the SG&A supporting the franchisees. So in effect, we could have blunted the volume even more if we didn't want to we didn't believe that the sun is coming out again and we want to be at full strength. So those are the balances. Gross margin is a big -- if you look at the gross margin overall the corporation, C&I is up 220 basis points RS&I up 50 basis points. The overall corporation is 5.6%, only down 10 basis points. So what you're seeing in our financials are, boy, we're still pretty robust. That's why I love the idea of C&I and RS&I Boeing up the turbulence of the Tools Group because if you look at the overall business, you say, hey, this business at the gross margin level looks pretty healthy. Operator : And our next question will come from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Gary Prestopino : Just wanted to address the corporate expenses look like they were down and I would assume that's the impact of the legal settlement, right? Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Except -- down, I don't know, like, what, $18 million or something like that? Maybe equal change. Okay. This hands me to tell you this, there, pains me nearly you got $11.2 million, I think, for the legal settlement and [indiscernible] change for reduced management stock-based compensation and bonuses estimated for the. So it hurts me to tell you that on this call. But in fact, that's a difference in this quarter. Gary Prestopino : Right. And I could also see the stock comp was down. And I guess what I'm getting at is that looking forward in the back half of the year, should it be some -- without the impact of any legal settlement? Should it be somewhere between $20 million and $25 million a quarter? Nick Pinchuk : I more at the top end of that. I would think more of the top end of that, actually. That's it I think. Gary Prestopino : The other question I want to ask you is quite obvious that there's a slowdown here in the buying of diagnostic equipment. Some of it deals with the fact that you just had a great year last year. But when does it get to the point where the technician or the shop starts falling behind, if ever, if that occurs really with not upgrading their diagnostic product. And my understanding is that with these products, it really speeds up your production being able to repair cars. So does that start coming into play here as we work deeper into this? Nick Pinchuk : Sure. It does. I think -- this is the thing. I think you've got 2 things going on. One, I hate to say the comparison but it is true that we launched a new product last second quarter and you're comparing against that. But you also have the technicians clear aversion for bigger ticket items at this point. They don't want to -- they're less like, you can see it broadly in the originations. They're gravitating towards other things. I was with franchisees and garage owners and Syracuse and in Atlanta and I had all the regional guys in here and I was watering them for probably longer than they wanted to be questions -- and they all said the same thing. People are starting -- they're just worried there's a fear in the situation of where they're going. So they don't want to get embroiled and pay them back over years as much. They're a little more conservative about that. They're not probably in the spending. So you see but your overarching point is quite true. Eventually, people have to say, people do say, boy and it's like it you could -- the car nowadays usually be able to take the car by sound. Now you have to look at the -- most we'll have to look at the trouble codes and try to the troubled points mean and then try to fix it. That's what scanners they tell you the trouble codes are. Those are the simpler and competitive diagnostic unit. But ours, what we confirmed in the legal settlement, we have a proprietary database that will take those data points, those data points, those trouble codes and decaled them tell you what's actually wrong with the car. Right now, the previous that, you can only scan, you have to figure that out for yourself. Our database will put you right on target. So eventually, as the cars go up in complexity, people aren't going to be able to -- just like they haven't been able to read now, they're not able to read the even get an idea about the car, even start without knowing what the trouble costs. In the future, they're going to have to be able to decode the trouble code because it's going to get even more complex and you see that weighing on the situation. And so we expect that to all figure out. That will all come out in the next -- over the next period. We'll be launching new diagnostics which will have new hardware and our software keeps getting better. Now one of the things we do see, Gary, is supporting your point is people who have diagnostics really fall in love with them and so they want to update their software. Our subscriptions are going up. Part of the reason why the tools was able to hold its margins is because it's software content is moving upwards. So people value it but eventually, they're going to want hardware. Operator : Our next question will come from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. David MacGregor : Nick, let me just ask you about sort of the second half and expectations here. I mean given second quarter negative organic growth in Snap-on tools. Does that suggest second half growth should be negative as well. And I mean, 2Q was not a challenging compare. And so I guess I'm just wondering how much forward visibility you have given the truck inventory levels and pre-SFC order growth? Nick Pinchuk : Well. I don't know. I think I wouldn't have said that Q2 last year, you're right. On a year-over-year basis, if you just look at year-over-year, Q2 last year was down. It wasn't down, it was tepid, let's say. So it wasn't -- in that space, it wasn't as strong. But if you look back, if you look sequentially the movement between the first quarter and the second quarter isn't that much different in the last year versus this year. So it's not so inconsistent. It isn't like it isn't like that's a big difference. If you're talking about the second half, boy, there's a lot of things going on. One is that for some time, so it's hard to judge what the second half would be like. You're not going to get me to say that it will be negative in the second half because we have plants, we think provide some overcoming to that. And for some time now, for several quarters, the sales off the van have been bigger than the sales to the man on a year-over-year basis. Now we saw some of that change towards the end of the quarter. So I don't know where it's going to go. If you want to look at it -- so from a -- I would say when you look at it from an operational point of view, do you think sooner or later, this is going to have to play out more positively. But then when you look at uncertainty, your guess is as good as mine about how the uncertainty is going to play out. It seems to me as though, like I said in my remarks, the hits just keep on common. And so does anybody think -- if you look at the uncertainty in the world that it's less uncertainty -- or is the same today as it was, say, 3 months ago? I don't think so. I don't think so. And so you hear that out of the technicians. I don't know where it's going the third quarter or the fourth quarter, it's hard to say. But I think there's some positives that would mitigate towards positivity, the things we're doing the product we're bringing out the pivots we're making. But on the other hand, if you look at the macros, it's a black hole. You don't know it's very opaque. So your guess is good as mine in that situation. All I know is the only thing I can control is to try to do the pivot to try to match what the technicians and take advantage of every opportunity we have and the message of this quarter is, is that RS&I and C&I, show that the model works in those places and I can make a lot of money and they provide good offsets. David MacGregor : Right. Nick, you -- the operating expenses in the second quarter in the Snap-on Tools segment deleveraged. You characterized that mostly as volume-related I guess it sounds now like you're about to lean more heavily into training and maybe advertising and promotions. And I'm just wondering how you expect that OpEx to continue deleveraging, in the second half? Nick Pinchuk : I don't know. What happened -- my view on the second quarter, you may have a different view of it might view the second quarter was, we didn't back off. We kept spending the same. We spent a little bit more [indiscernible]. David MacGregor : So we continue doing that in the second half? Nick Pinchuk : More volumes. So I'm not talking that I'm going to sally forth with a lot more expenses but I'm holding the support I'm holding a support. We're doing what we do only we're adjusting it to match the current situation. I didn't mean my comments before that we're going to open the plug dates and spend a lot more. I didn't mean that. What I meant is I'm holding because I thought we were doing a pretty good job of supporting before. Now I think we held that in the second quarter. We'll probably do that again but it will be a different array versus the match to the current environment. David MacGregor : Got it. And then can you just talk about cadence within the quarter? You mentioned a moment ago in responding to the question that your trucks were destocking right up until late in the quarter. Nick Pinchuk : Yes, right. David MacGregor : I was just going to get you to talk about cadence. Please go ahead. Nick Pinchuk : Cadence was pretty, I think, consistent throughout the quarter. I think towards the end of the quarter, we had less destocking events in the last month or so. that's a positive. However, sometimes, I'll tell you, David, sometimes that happens because it's the last month. So it's hard for me to interpret whether that's a last month phenomenon that happens once in a while, not uncommonly but not all the time. It hasn't happened recently but it did happen. So maybe that's a positive. It's not for us to predict that out of the 1 month. But I think if you go back through the quarter, it was about the same levels. The relationship was the [indiscernible] except for the land. David MacGregor : And your early July experience wouldn't give you a framework for interpreter? Nick Pinchuk : No. It's too early. And then you got too much stuff floating through July. Somebody asked me, not on the call but asked me well, are people pulling back in early July, waiting for the SFC, the responding -- we did have, like I said just a minute ago, we had the Super 7 program that rolled out and seemed to be pre well received with this full array of hand tools. We gave him a great jackpot blast the hand tools for this promotion. And that seems to get enthusiasm up and it's pretty close to expectation. I think it was the kind of sellout type of things or close to sell it. So that seemed to go okay. But that is an evidence to proclaim where the world is going. It's better than a pulp in the Iowa to sustain but you're not going to be able to -- can't extrapolate to -- it's dangerous to extrapolate out of that too much. Now I hope it is. The flood gates go up and everything is going to go well. Happy days are here again. David MacGregor : Last question for me. Last question for me, if I could. Just on credit. I mean what are you seeing increase in RA transfers? And what would originations look like without the RA transfers and Credit penetration [ph]. Aldo Pagliari : The mix of activities is pretty much similar to last quarter. So no, they have not pivoted to RA transfers as a method of funding activity on demand or anything like that. Operator : Our next question will come from Scott Stember with Roth MKM. Scott Stember : Nick, is there a way of trying to see how much of the tool sales decline is really just based on the fact that you still don't have the available capacity to make product? Just trying to frame that out -- and If you can't do that, maybe just give us an idea of when would you expect to have all of the capacity and all the bottlenecks could up to make sure that you're at least making what they need? Nick Pinchuk : You're thinking towards the -- if everything is in place, it gets better every Dick's got. You know what I mean, we get for every day in that situation. Because some of the capacity is in there and so the machines are there. Well, for example, we're half -- we're 50% of the expand we wanted in Flex stock in Milwaukee. So that's helping us but it's not enough. And so you've got adjustable wrenches, not enough. You've got some of the smaller ticket tool stores, not enough. So we're getting out of those. On the other hand, it's hard for me to say how much really would play out. I mean that would give you a legal boost. So, I do think you saw -- as you know, in the quarter, when you're selling small -- when you pivot to smaller kit items, you got to sell a lot of wrenches to make up a tool storage box. So it tends to put a, what I would call, a weight on your overall revenue. But I think you saw some of that in this quarter. We're trying to fill up the bucket on that but -- it's going to take us a while to do. Now, third quarter will be better than the second and the fourth quarter will be better in the first quarter after that will be better. So when the -- translating that in the revenue and profit numbers, it's hard for me to say, really hard for me to say. So I can't really put a number on it. Scott Stember : And then, just last question. When you're talking with the shops and just with your franchisees, what are you hearing about how your competitors are faring at least at the shop level -- just trying to sense if there's a share loss or... Nick Pinchuk : I don't -- tell you the truth, competitors shop guys or tech never really mentioned the competitors to me. So -- but I don't know. I'm a CEO. So I'm not so sure they would I don't know. But they never really -- you go into the shop, you'll see -- you can see, I don't see any increased presence of the competitors. I will tell you that when I talk to franchisees, or I talked to our regional sales developers, we're all in here for 12 hours in a room with me. They didn't mention the competition really. I think we would say that the enemies we have are mostly uncertainty and us. So we're trying to -- the speed at which we can pivot helps some of the problem but the uncertainty will still lay over even when we fully pivoted. So you kind of got that going on. We don't see any incursion in -- that doesn't mean we don't look that headed product with a fine tooth comb and try to figure out, well, do they have something we don't have? Can people say it's better? What is their pricing, how do they deliver? How do they support what kinds of things can it do for the customer? We do that all the time. But I don't think that's part of our problem. It does appear to be. Usually, the competitors are selling to a different customer base actually. Operator : And our next question will come from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Christopher Glynn : Was just first curious about net cash position now, the remaining repurchase authorization is a small proportion of your liquidity. So your kind of balance sheet positions in a different spot than I've seen in past years. I'm wondering how you think about that? Nick Pinchuk : I'm bit about it. But look, I think you have to reassess how we're going -- I mean the thing is we -- I think you know our view of cash usage going forward, capital usage. And the first idea is to make sure our business is fully funded. Secondly is we look at the dividend which -- the dividend is coming up and we have paid a dividend every quarter since 1939 and we have never reduced it. So we assessed that in perpetuity -- sorry, guiding principle. But we have increased the dividend. I think now every quarter for almost 13 years, if we lease it again, it will be the 14. I'm not giving you any insight information about whether we're going to increase or go flat or anything but we'll be looking at that pretty carefully. Then we have acquisitions which we're constantly looking at -- and you've heard the story before that we have this landscape. In fact, we have guided as we speak, looking at other acquisitions. And I don't know if they'll play out or not because we're careful with our money. And then we have stock buyback which you already pointed out, as an authorization now that's a little bit less than it was before. And so we'll have to assess that as we go forward. That's how I'm thinking of it really. Christopher Glynn : Okay. And my follow-up, just back to SOT curious if there's any interesting geographic dispersion. We've got an entry here, lots of regions, different economies to a degree on the incremental weakening, you seen any kind of dispersion in regions? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I can tell you this. In the last 6 months, I've met with franchisees and customers in almost like in the Midwest, in the East just recently in Syracuse in Atlanta and the Southwest. And there hasn't been that much difference. That's one stretchers. I think there's uncertainty, we saw this before. I do think the grassroots economy is impacted by the uncertainty broadly and the text may be among -- maybe the techs are special because car repairs continues robust. So there are -- a lot of people are confident poor but the techs are also cash rich in that situation. So that may be that may be part of the issue. I don't see much. And I talked to our regional guys, all 9 meters were in here. Any there's some differences and we try to look at those differences and try to figure out maybe should we facilitize more. Are they -- are those operations? We haven't been able to come up with much actually. So I don't see much difference even though you would say there would be you don't really -- you get the same story from text everywhere. Christopher Glynn : Do you think tax did get hit with more regulatory and compliance costs? Nick Pinchuk : The tax, I don't know. I don't think the tax, the garages may be. The garages might get more regulatory compliance costs. I don't think the tax is so much. They don't mention it so much, I think. I don't hear that but I just -- small businesses, I mean the national soul change [ph] in manufacturing goes while over regulations, you know. They talk about how much it cost, they say it for every small manufacturer. So every small manufacturer has to pay $35,000 per employee per year in regulation costs. So I think by extension, you would say small businesses like garages would have that problem. But I don't think the tax [ph] would be burdened with it. Operator : And our next question will come from Tom Hayes with CL King. Tom Hayes : Thanks guys. Appreciate you fitting in. Just quickly, Nick, maybe any color you could provide on what you're seeing on the positive side on the critical industries. I think you guys called it out as a bit of a bright spot. Is there anything maybe on avionics or military or natural resources that stands out? Nick Pinchuk : You mean booming as it is, is that the. Yes, no -- [indiscernible] up double digits again. And the military has been consistently strong a cool thing is we include education in the critical industries because we believe it's critical to influence. And one of the things about it is the education business has been up nicely. And what that says is the young people are Hungary for Snap-on products. And so that's a cool thing for us. We really like that. So you see that. I don't have anything in terms of, boy, it seemed like aviation was strong this quarter and I would expect to continue -- and you have to believe, given the Boeing situation that customers in aviation would be pretty anxious to be able to have accuracy and documentation which we offer in spades in our product for that particular industry and I think that's driving some of it. I think the military is obvious. I think the military -- every nation is on edge. For example, you have countries in Europe who are looking to double their military and they're coming to us to help them upgrade to manage their fleet of claims. And so you see some of that. So I think those 2 types of general trusts are working. But you also see in general industry were strong. The overall industry is strong because I think the industry in this time is looking for efficiency and repair is efficiently, the quicker you can do it. Now the overarching thing that we're noting is that in all these industries, they're looking for customized products that will match their particular problems because the critical industries is replete with those opportunities and tasks where you have to have a particular array of products to match them. That's why the custom kitting is doing so well. We almost have not many competitors in this situation as a manufacturer. So that is really working for us. And it seems like whatever whenever we give the industrial group one way, they run the daylight and take it. So I think we're pretty good about that position, that business. Operator : This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today.

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks Sara. Good morning everyone. As usual, I'll start with the highlights of our third quarter. I'll provide my perspectives on the results, on our markets, and on our path ahead. After that, Aldo will give you a detailed review of the financials. My perspective, I am encouraged and we believe our third quarter was encouraging, another period of broad profitability growth and significant forward progress, product and process success, and clear traction in our Tools Group pivot to quick paybacks. Of course, the quarter again had its challenges, ongoing macro pressures creating obstacles of uncertainty, just like we've encountered before. But in the end, we adjusted, withstood the turbulence, took advantage of the opportunities, and drove another strong earnings performance. And all of that is written clearly across the results. Here they are. Third quarter sales of $1,147 million were slightly down from the $1,159.3 million recorded last year. On an organic basis, excluding $200,000 in unfavorable foreign currency translation and $7.2 million from acquisitions, our organic sales were lower by 1.7%. But the OpCo operating income was up, and the OI margin was 22%, up 80 basis points, setting a new benchmark for our third quarters. For financial services, the OI grew to $71.7 million, that's up from the $69.4 million of 2023, a number that when combined with our OpCo result, raised our consolidated OI margin to 26%, up 90 basis points from last year's 25.1%. And EPS, it was $4.70, a nice gain from last year's $4.51. So, those are the overall results, marked by operating capability, structural balance, and consistent resilience prevailing against significant headwinds. Now, let's take a view of the market. During the third quarter, automotive repair remained robust. It continued to expand in complexity. New models entered the market, unveiling a rollout of new drivetrains, motor configurations, and high-tech electrical systems that control a neural network of sensors woven together that enable driver-assisted vehicle autonomy, all of it housed in modern chassis, fashioned out of space age materials. And this cavocated [ph] sophisticated advancements combined with an aging car park, now averages 12.6 years to make fixing vehicles even more challenging if you're from Snap-on. This is music to your ears and the hits just keep on coming, creating opportunities for years to come. Let's talk about organizations. The OEM, the dealerships, the independent garages, the segment that primarily focuses on infrastructure-type investments, recovering things like renovating bays and upgrading repair equipment, meeting the challenges of new vehicle models and expanding shop capacities to match the rise in repair work, driven by the ongoing increase in vehicle complexity. New lifts to support the extra weight of battery systems, sophisticated undercar equipment to calibrate the driver assist systems that enable vehicle automation and more powerful software suites for managing parts rooms, service space, and customer interfaces, enhanced vehicle communication devices to interact with the more complex designs and more powerful repair information databases to read, to diagnose, and to fix the vehicles of the now and of the future. Our repair information group or RS&I thrives in this world of complexity, serving repair shop owners and managers, delivering solutions that make the full repair path much easier, paving the way forward with innovative dealership management systems, proprietary one-of-a-kind intelligent diagnostics platforms, and the full array of capable shop equipment. Now, the opportunities for the garages is strong, but uncertain interest rates, rumors of tax changes, and worries over the elections are all weighing on investment decisions, creating a mixed landscape across the market, but the overall outlook still remains quite positive. And we believe that Snap-on and RS&I are poised to participate fully in the abundant opportunities. Now, let's shift to the technician market. These are the folks who decipher the data, touch the screen, diagnose the problems, twirl the wrenches and wheel their extraordinary skills to execute the repair. It's where our van network applies its trade. In that regard, the third quarter is always a great time for me because it's when we hold our annual Snap-on Franchisee Conference, or SFC. It's a gathering of men and women who drive the vans and call on hundreds of thousands of techs every week. It's an unmatched connection to the world of vehicle repair. Again, this year, I had extended conversations with dozens and dozens of our franchisees and each encounter resonated with enthusiasm. We say Snap-on prevails in turbulence and proceeds with confidence and the franchisees know it's true. Now, with that said, the macro environment is still weighing on our technician customers with considerable uncertainty, driven by the election and its perceived impact, the fears of ongoing inflation by border pressure and by the specter of prolonged wars. The shops are full, yech wages are up, the hours are expanding, and the demand for tech continues. They have cash, but they're still confidence poor. The bad news they get every day for breakfast is weighing on them. Right now, they're hesitant on the future and as such, they're reluctant on big ticket items with longer paybacks. So, to accommodate, the Tools Group continues to pivot, focusing on shorter payback items to match the technicians' current preferences. And the third quarter results confirm that it's working. So, we believe the automotive repair market is robust. Current uncertainty notwithstanding, it's a great place to operate. Now, let's turn to the critical industries, where the penalty for failure is high, this is where our commercial and industrial group or C&I makes its living. It's challenging, rugged environments like oil and gas platforms, mining sites, and battlefields, but it also includes sensitive and sophisticated atmospheres needed to manufacture computer chips to build airplanes and to launch rockets. The customers in this segment are organizations big and small, and they're more influenced by the data than the text, interest rates, GDP, and industry demands. And as such, these segments are pretty positive. And we see it in the results, growth in aviation, in defense, in general industries, and sectors that need our precision torque device to execute and document accuracy and the areas enabled by our custom kits, packages that meet the specific needs of the tasks that improve quality, productivity, and safety. In other words, solutions that are right up our alley. This is also the segment where our largest international presence is. And consequently, it's the segment with the headwinds of geopolitical turbulence. In that regard, Europe continues to vary region-by-region. The South remains positive, but several countries, particularly in the North, are dealing with difficulty in some cases, technical recessions. And in Asia, it's also mixed. China is still recovering from the pandemic and the effects of the extended lockdowns. At the same time, Korea and Japan are resilient. So, there are geographic challenges in the critical industries. But overall, this market is positive. The potential is considerable, and we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these possibilities. Well, those are the markets. Now, let's -- those are the markets -- in summary, automotive repair is mixed in the now, but broad potential for the future. And the critical industries are still robust and rich with opportunities. Now, let's talk about the operating groups. In C&I, sales of $365.7 million compared to $366.4 million registered last year. Sales excluding $7.3 million of acquisition-related volume -- excluding the $7.2 million of acquisition-related volume, the organic sales were down by 2.1%. From an earnings perspective, however, C&I OI of $61 million improved by $2.9 million or 5% over last year, and the OI margin was 16.7%, up 80 basis points, expanding to -- equaling the record high established in the last quarter. The major contributor was our industrial division, continuing its upward trajectory and strong profitability, wielding the capacity provided by its new kitting center in Kenosha and meeting the rising demand for customized solutions along the way. In addition to our investments in the kitting center, our acquisition of Mountz last year is rolling into its 12th month, and it's been a valuable contributor in meeting the needs of our customers for small precision torque. Torque continues to be -- to rise in significance with critical industry customers. And to meet this need, we packaged our existing medium and heavy-duty torque products with Mountz's lighter offerings, giving us a wide spectrum of clamping forces -- the wide spectrum of clamping forces that are essential to the critical industry from oil and gas to the aviation to defense. We're capitalizing on that opportunity and the quarter showed it. Our specialty torque business rose significantly both in volume and in profitability. We also continued adding to our portfolio of professional cordless tools, engineered products, aligned with the work performed and the expectations of techs doing repairs. For the serious people of work, new products can add great value and our quarter was marked by that effect. For working on large equipment and over-the-road trucks, we unveiled a CT9175 3.75-inch 18-volt impact, not for the faint of heart. This unit delivers 1,550 foot-pounds of bolt breakaway torque. It's ideal for the most challenging jobs. The rugged lightweight housing shakes off harsh environments. The ergonomic design reduces stress and fatigue, pretty important when you're wielding 1,550 foot-pounds. And this 9175 monster has a great feature set to boot like LED spotlights, multiple power settings, and a variable speed trigger to just apply the right torque to the job. It's a great tool. Just what you'd expect from Snap-on, powerful application, easy to use and very efficient. It's a tool that techs increasingly want in their arsenal when they're fighting the toughest jobs. The 9175, it's a great productivity enhancer and the technicians have noticed. One last thought about the results. C&I kept investing in the quarter, maintaining and expanding our advantage in product, brands, and in people. Operating expenses were 140 basis points of sales higher than last year. But with the benefits of rapid continuous improvement, or RCI, the value of new -- and the value of new products, gross margins rose by 220 basis points and the OI margin, despite the spending, was up 80 basis points, higher spending and higher profits without additional scale. That's C&I, innovative products, custom solutions, precision instruments, all combined to reach customers in critical industries and extend the Snap-on brand out of the garage with momentum and profitability. Now, for the Tools Group. Sales in the third quarter of $500.5 million included an organic decrease of 3.1% with a U.S. decrease that was not much different. The OI margin in the period was 21.6%, down 40 basis points from last year due to the lower volume. With that said, gross margins remained strong, improving 100 basis points, driven by new products, RCI, and manufacturing efficiencies. That was quite a feat actually. And during the period, our team maintained its focus on product development, designing solutions that make work easier and provide customers with quick paybacks. And that pivot is taking hold, closing the deficit both overall in the U.S. to less than half it was in the second quarter. And that trend was reinforced in the period by sales being $18.5 million higher than the second quarter. With summer vacation and SFC breaks, we haven't seen the Tools Group up sequentially in the third quarter for some time. We believe it's a sign of considerable momentum. The Tools Group is coming back. Beyond the numbers, we held our annual SFC in August this year in Orlando with attendance reaching 9,000 franchisees, guests, and Snap-on associates. This tool show spanned over three football fields showcasing the latest in product innovation, more than 4,500 SKUs strong. The weekend also was packed with training sessions, purposely designed to grow each fan's business and expand the franchisees' already substantial product knowledge. Among those seminars was an in-depth review of our intelligent diagnostic portfolio with instructors connected directly to the vehicles, communicating with the cars in real-time and clearly demonstrating our industry-leading advantage. It attracted a lot of attention. And we celebrated Saturday night by transporting the entire crew in what could be described as an armada of buses to SeaWorld for a night of roller coasters, aquatic shows, and a lot of fun. It was another memorable event, but principally, it serves as a testament to the unique bond that our franchisees hold with the Snap-on team. I believe anyone attending would affirm that the franchisees left reassured on the power of our operation, enthusiastic about their way forward with our enterprise and convinced that Snap-on really does prevail in difficulty and proceed with confidence. The product booths at this year's event were pretty busy. We're busy, especially near the Cartway to Heaven. It was an eye-catching and colorful wall of mobile tool carts. The model that stole the show was our brand-new KRSC 2460 flip-top roll cart, a unit that offers Snap-on tool storage in a quick payback form, just what techs want in today's world. That's why it was so popular. The 2460 can hold a significant breadth of sockets, wrenches, and power tools in a variety of drawers that range from 2-inch to 3-inch to 5-inch configurations. And the ultra-deep top compartment is designed with five AC outlets and two USB ports to ensure that electrical devices are charged and at-the-ready for any use at any time. The launch was a significant success, and it provides even more testimony that the Tools Group traction to pivoting -- and pivoting to shorter payback items is working. Also on the shop floor were products highlighting Snap-on's customer connection. We stand next to mechanics, observing work, experiencing the complexity of vehicle repair, and we use those insights gained and design innovations that make work easier. One such custom solution available at the SFC was our new S8400 half-inch drive axle spindle nut socket. That's a mouthful. It's manufactured right here in the U.S.A., our Elkmont, Alabama plant. Since 2022, GM 3500 heavy-duty pickups have used a unique fastener that's very deep into the axle -- inside the axle hub. It's a very difficult and time-consuming operation to extract it with standard tooling. So, our new specially designed socket reaches in, links precisely with the embedded fastener, and it makes the removal or installation safe, quick, and effortless. Each vehicle is unique and a range of different repairs are needed as they age. This is the motherload for a toolmaker and Snap-on customer connection positions our team to have just the device to match the task. It's a great advantage that was on display at the SFC and it was on display in our third quarter results. The Tools Group, pivoting to quick paybacks, launching differentiating new products, and summoning resilience against the headwinds. Now, for RS&I. Sales of $422.7 million in the third quarter represented an organic decline of 1.9%. Lower sales in undercar equipment and reduced activity with OEM dealerships were partially offset by higher sales in diagnostics and information products to independent shops -- for independent shops. In effect, declines in hardware, balanced by gains in software. OI for RS&I was $107.3 million, up 2.3% compared to last year, despite the lower sales and the OI margin of 25.4%, one of the group's highest for some time, was up 110 basis points from 2023. All of it was authored by big product and RCI-driven gains in gross -- RCI-driven gains in gross margins, partially offset by spending in operating expenses. Gross margin is up, operating expense is balancing some of it, but it was all the investment was there to maintain and extend our advantages and so we did. During the quarter, RS&I launched its latest addition to our intelligent diagnostic lineup, the APOLLO+. This is a new ergonomically designed handheld that offers a 2-second boot up, the fastest in the industry and a large 10-inch touchscreen for improved visibility and navigation. Most importantly, the platform is powered by our proprietary intelligent diagnostic software with almost 3 billion data records and over 400 billion unique diagnostic events, all organized to help technicians diagnose and fix vehicles much faster. It was introduced in mid-August, toward the end of the quarter, and it represents a tech's most economical way to wield the power of intelligent diagnostics. And it already has the customers' attention. Our on the Street feedback says the new sophisticated platform with a quick payback is a real hit and we believe it has a great future. We're encouraged by the strength of our handheld diagnostics and the other unique solutions we provide and that confidence is reinforced by outside experts. Our SOLUS handheld was eligible for the 2024 awards and it was cited by Motor Magazine as one of the top of the 2024 Top 20 Tools. And it was also recognized by Power Tools and Equipment News, or P10, for one of its -- as one of the 2024 People's Choice Awards, that's a distinction based on the endorsements from real technicians, actual users from all across the nation. RS&I also received P10 recognitions for its Collision Repair package. It's on-truck brake-wave, it's heavy-duty diagnostic software and its M1, Mitchell 1 Shop Management System. Collectively this year, across all our operations, Snap-on won 20 such awards. Product is a Snap-on advantage, and everybody knows it. We're confident in the strength of RS&I and we'll keep driving to expand its position with repair shop owners and managers, making work easier, the base more productive, and providing the garages with the means to match the ever-growing challenges of modern vehicle repair. Well, those are the third quarter results. Tools Group, demonstrating improvement sequentially, pivoting effectively to meet customer preferences. C&I and RS&I, innovative new products and operating efficiencies, managing the headwinds, producing benchmark OI margins. And for the overall corporation, sales organically down 1.7%, but OpCo OI, up 2.9%. Opco OI margin of 22%, up 80 basis points; and EPS, $4.70, up 4.2%, rising over every comparison, all achieved against the wins. It was another encouraging quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks Nick. Our consolidated operating results are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,147 million in the quarter compared to $1,159.3 million last year, reflecting a 1.7% organic sales decline and $300,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by $7.2 million of acquisition-related sales. Despite the ongoing uncertainties of the current environment, overall sales activity in the quarter can be characterized as stable. And while our franchise van channel revenues continue to be tempered by technician confidence, the Tools Group generated higher sales sequentially versus last quarter. Generally, the third quarter reflects lower sales dollar activity as compared to the second quarter. Consolidated gross margin improved 130 basis points to 51.2% from 49.9% last year, reflecting increased sales in higher gross margin businesses, benefits from the company's RCI initiatives and lower material and other costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales rose 50 basis points to 29.2% from 28.7% in 2023, primarily due to the lower sales volumes. Operating earnings before financial services of $252.4 million in the quarter compared to $245.2 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22% represented an improvement of 80 basis points from the 21.2% reported last year. Financial services' revenues of $100.4 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to $94.9 million last year, while operating earnings of $71.7 million compared to $69.4 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $324.1 million compared to $314.6 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin increased 90 basis points to 26% from 25.1% in 2023. Our third quarter effective income tax rate of 22.9% compared to 22.6% last year. Net earnings of $251.1 million compared to $243.1 million in 2023 and net earnings per diluted share of $4.70 in the quarter compared to $4.51 per diluted share last year, an increase of 4.2%. Now, let's turn to our segment results for the quarter, starting with C&I on Slide 7. Sales of $365.7 million compared to $366.4 million last year, reflecting a 2.1% organic sales decline, partially offset by $7.2 million of acquisition-related sales. The organic decrease is primarily due to double-digit reduction with respect to intersegment sales of power tools and a mid-single-digit decline in the segment's European-based hand tool businesses. These were partially offset by a gain in sales to customers in critical industries, including a high single-digit increase in specialty torque. With respect to critical industries, in addition to higher torque product sales, defense and aviation-related activity was strong, but it was somewhat offset by declines in the natural resources sector. Gross margin improved 220 basis points to 41.2% in the third quarter from 39% in 2023. This was largely due to the increased sales volume and higher gross margin critical industry sectors, lower material and other costs, savings from RCI initiatives, and 50 basis points of benefit from acquisitions. These improvements were partially offset by 30 basis points of unfavorable foreign currency effects. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 140 basis points to 24.5% in the quarter from 23.1% in 2023, primarily due to investments in personnel and other costs and a 50 basis point impact from acquisitions. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $61 million compared to $58.1 million last year. The operating margin improved 80 basis points to 16.7% from 15.9% in 2023. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $500.5 million compared to $515.4 million a year ago, reflecting a 3.1% organic sales decline and $900,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a mid-single-digit decline in our U.S. business, partially offset by a low single-digit gain in our international operations. That being said, it is meaningful to highlight that sales in the historically lower third quarter period are higher than the $482 million recorded in the second quarter of this year, representing a sequential increase of 3.8%. We believe this as well as the more modest year-over-year sales decline in the U.S. van network in the third quarter than in previous quarters favorably demonstrates the resilience of this business. Gross margin improved 100 basis points to 47.3% in the quarter from 46.3% last year, primarily due to lower material and other costs and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 140 basis points to 25.7% in the quarter from 24.3% in 2023, largely due to the lower sales volume. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $108.3 million compared to $113.4 million last year. The operating margin of 21.6% compared to 22% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $422.7 million compared to $431.8 million in 2023, reflecting a 1.9% organic sales decline and $900,000 of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease includes a mid-single-digit decline in the sales of undercar equipment and a low single-digit reduction in activity with OEM dealerships, where we often see variability in essential tool programs from period-to-period. These decreases were partially offset by a low single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. Gross margin improved 190 basis points to 47.4% from 45.5% last year, primarily reflecting increased sales of higher gross margin products. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 80 basis points to 22% from 21.2% in 2023, largely due to lower sales volumes and increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $107.3 million compared to $104.9 million last year. The operating margin improved 110 basis points to 25.4% from the 24.3% reported last year. Now, turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $5.5 million or 5.8% to $100.4 million from $94.9 million last year, primarily reflecting the growth of the loan portfolio. Financial services operating earnings of $71.7 million compared to $69.4 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $3.2 million from 2023 levels, including $2.4 million of higher provisions for credit losses. Sequentially, the provisions for credit losses were lower by $1.6 million. In the third quarters of both 2024 and 2023, the average yield on finance receivables was 17.7%. In the third quarters of 2024 and 2023, the average yield on contract receivables were 9.1% and 8.8%, respectively. Total loan originations of $288 million in the third quarter represented a decrease of $17.2 million or 5.6% from 2023 levels, reflecting a 6.7% decline in extended credit originations and a 1.3% decrease in originations of contract receivables. The decrease in extended credit originations mostly reflects lower sales of big-ticket items. Geographically, extended credit originations were consistent with the sales activity in the Tools Group with the decline in the U.S. only partially offset by growth in originations internationally. Moving to Slide 11. Our quarter end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60-day plus delinquency rate of 1.9% is up 40 basis points from the third quarter of 2023. Trailing 12-month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $62.3 million represented 3.11% of outstandings at quarter end. While delinquencies and net losses are trending upward, we believe that these portfolio performance metrics remain relatively balanced considering the current environment. Now, turning to Slide 12. Cash provided by operating activities of $274.2 million in the quarter represented 106% of net earnings and compared to $285.4 million last year. The decrease in cash flow as compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily reflects increases in working investment, which were partially offset by higher net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $40.5 million mostly reflected net additions to finance receivables of $20.6 million and capital expenditures of $20.4 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $156.2 million included cash dividends of $97.9 million and the repurchase of 215,000 shares of common stock for $59.9 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of quarter end, we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $471.5 million of common stock under our existing authorizations, including under the $500 million authorization recently approved by the Board of Directors in August of this year. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $5.1 million from 2023 year-end. Days sales outstanding of 61 days compared to 60 days at year-end 2023. Inventories decreased $10.1 million from 2023 year-end. On a trailing 12-month basis, inventory turns of 2.3 remained unchanged from year-end. Our quarter end cash position of $1,313.3 million compared to $1,1.5 million at year-end 2023. In addition to cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities. As of quarter end, there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility and there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. That concludes my remarks on our third quarter performance. I'll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2024. For the full year, we expect that capital expenditures will be approximately $100 million and we currently anticipate that our full year 2024 effective income tax rate will be in the range of 22% to 23%. Finally, with respect to corporate costs, we would expect expenses in the upcoming fourth quarter to be more in line with those incurred in the third quarter of this year as the fourth quarter of 2023 included some benefit for the recovery of costs associated with a legal matter, which will not repeat. I'll now turn the call back to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? A - Nick Pinchuk : Well, thanks, Aldo. Well, that's our quarter, resilience against the turbulence. We believe the period demonstrated that with great clarity. Sales attenuated, but great products solving critical tasks, material savings, and RCI drove strong and substantial gains in gross margins, strong enough that we're able to keep investing in our product, brand, and our people, maintaining and building them for the opportunities to come, and still increase OI margins significantly. And all of that was authored by the ongoing characteristics of our -- of the Snap-on Enterprise. Businesses that are strategically positioned for advantage for establishing and maintaining ongoing connections to the customers, processes embedded in Snap-on value creation that really do deliver progress every day. And a very capable team that's committed to our enterprise, greatly experienced and battle-tested and is well able to consistently marshal advantage to drive -- for driving positive outcomes and you see that all across the corporation. C&I sales down low single-digits for profits up, OI margin, 16.7%, up 80 basis points. Gross margins up 220 basis points, gains from wielding customization in the critical industries. The Tools Group, meeting the challenges -- of the challenges of the day, executing the pivot to quick payback items, closing the sales gap and displaying momentum. Sales down low single-digits, OI margin is 21.6%, down 40 basis points, but gross margins up 100 basis points. RS&I, wielding its advantage with software, sales down low single-digits, but profits up and OI margins of 25.4%, up 110 basis points and gross margins up 190 basis points and it all came together as a corporation. Sales attenuated lower by 1.7% organically, but OI rising from last year. OI margins reaching 22%, up 80 basis points and gross margins up triple-digit basis points all across the corporation and an EPS of $4.70, up versus every -- up over every comparison. It was another encouraging quarter. And we believe that propelled by our device -- decisive advantage in our product, in our brand, and our people, all maintained and strengthened even in the turbulence, Snap-on will continue its momentum, so clearly demonstrated in the quarter and extend our trend of positive performance well on through the days and the years to come. Now, before I turn the call over to the operator, I want to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. As always, I know many of you are listening. Our quarter demonstrates that Snap-on does indeed prevail in turbulence. And once again, you are the creators of that result, hard one. For your achievements in authoring our success, you have my congratulations. For the skill, energy, and experience you bring to bear every day. On behalf of our team, you have my admiration and for your unshakable confidence in and dedication to the future of our enterprise, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Christopher Glynn : Thanks. Good morning Nick, Aldo, and Sara. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning Chris. Christopher Glynn : Good morning. I wanted to dive into the kind of seasonal strength at SOT. Does that feel like kind of a reset baseline for normal seasonal, kind of, patterns from here. We usually have a fourth quarter lift or -- maybe that gets into what the sell-in sell-through was in the third quarter, too, and that needs to be tested on the sell-through in the current quarter? Nick Pinchuk : The sell-through, as you know, hasn't been -- the sales off the van for some time have been a little bit more than our sales to the van. In this particular quarter, it was slightly reversed in that situation. The sales to the van were a little bit better. But the third quarter is kind of a hard one to predict. I always call it squirrely in that situation. So, we -- if it wasn't for the third quarter, I think this is much more definitive, but it's clear that the Tools Group is doing better, certainly did better in the third quarter. And we have not seen a third quarter over the second quarter in a dog's age, except for the one in the COVID where we had -- we came out in a V-shaped recovery in the third quarter. But you can look back for a long time and you don't see that. And this is the total group, and it's the U.S. in general and so we view it as some momentum. The question is, I suppose, will they be able to continue that momentum? We think they can. We like their products, and we like the fact that doing this has come out of their profitability up 100 basis points. They got a little bit of volume impact, but the 100 basis points of gross margin wielded by great new products and the manufacturing efficiencies in some ways that come out of the new expansions that are more productive than the old across the major plants in the United States. So, we think things are moving positively. But we don't give guidance, but I like our chances going forward for the tools. Christopher Glynn : Sounds great. And then just switching on RS&I. It's been very sturdy run rate, third quarter, a bit of a step down, historically, not much routine seasonality, though 3Q last year also kind of deviated a little lower versus kind of the way the business had been trending. So, curious if you can offer any insights around that? Maybe does it feel like the equipment side is entering an interim pause after some steady customers recapitalizing? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I'd say -- look, I think the thing as I stated that the -- I said in my -- very simple, hardware down, software up. So, the hardware piece is the equipment piece, and that was -- there was some attenuation of that. Some of that can be seasonal. I don't know, I wouldn't hang my hat on that, but there is a little bit of headwind in the third quarter. vacations that happened in the garages and so on and stuff like that. But I think there is some uncertainty in the garages that may weigh on that, and we'll see how that plays out going forward. Look, I think the other piece of it is the OEM lumpy business, which kind of hit a flat spot in this quarter, but we don't think that's going to be continuing every quarter. It's just that it's lumpy, and we happen to catch a lump, a downward lump, depression in this quarter. But the real good thing is if you look at the software businesses, you look at the diagnostics business, the Mitchell, those business, the diagnostics information, which is Mitchell and diagnostic itself to repair shop owners and managers up and those things are profitable. And then you have the sales of electronic parts catalogs, another software piece up. And if you look at the software in the Tools Group associated with diagnostics, yes, it's -- we're increasing -- we're following hardware launches, but increasing the software looks pretty strong. And if you look at the software in the diagnostic -- just in the Tools business, that's a pretty good piece of business that's up year-over-year, and that helped drive some of the profitability in the Tools Group. So, I feel pretty good about RS&I. I'm not so worried about it. I think -- and by the way, if you could trade off the software businesses at high margins for a little bit of turbulence in the hardware business, wouldn't you do it? I would. Christopher Glynn : Thank you, Nick. Operator : The next question is from Gary Prestopino with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. Gary Prestopino : Hey good morning all. Hey Nick, in your narrative, you did try and give us a peek here as to what this pivot in the Tools Group, how it impacted the quarter and on a quarterly basis, sequentially, you were up $18 million. Is -- could you maybe just help us here, was the majority of that sequential increase due to the pivot in sales? Nick Pinchuk : A lot of it was. Hand tools. Hand tools were the strongest category in this quarter. And it was a bigger -- why we -- why you can see the pivot is when you look at it all, I don't like parsing those numbers. It'd be a little bit squirrely from quarter-to-quarter. But really, hand tools represented a major mix of Tools Group sales to the franchisees in this quarter than for -- all the way back to the pandemic. And so that is helping drive this. That is the real testimony to the pivot because that is what we wanted to have happened because this is what customers are ready to buy, and that helped a lot of that situation. Plus it helps the margins. Gary Prestopino : Is it safe to say that a lot of this was due to new products coming into the market that you introduced? Nick Pinchuk : Well, I think yes and there are also promotions overlay -- look, we had 4,500 -- there's a little thing, 4,500 products, I think SKUs displayed in our Tool Show at the SFC and over 500 were new in some way. Now, I'm not saying they were all breakthrough products. But there were 500 of the 4,500 franchisees could say, I'm offering our customers something they couldn't quite have before. And so that qualifies as something new, and it gives you something to sell and that helped push some of this. And a lot of that was in that area. Although promotion can also make hand tools look good if you strike the right cord. You give away for example, buy a set of hand tools, you get a dinner with Aldo Pagliari, for example. This will sell a lot of things. Gary Prestopino : I'd buy a whole Snap-on toolbox of tools just to do that. Aldo Pagliari : I'll remember that. Gary Prestopino : The last question is, it seems like you've kind of talked about your torque products in C&I over the last couple of quarters. Now, has that -- is something changing in the market that is moving more towards specialty torque? I know you developed products and obviously, you've made some acquisitions in that area. But could you just help us out on what kind of secular tailwinds there are that's driving for? Nick Pinchuk : I can answer that in asking you a question. Can you say the word Boeing? Gary Prestopino : Yes. Nick Pinchuk : I think this is -- it's a little bit like, but this is kind of an example. I think people are becoming more and more aware that the mechanisms throughout critical industries are more and more complex and therefore, precision has to be greater than may have been applied in the past. So, one, you need more precise tools and torque wrenches are an element of that or a deliverer of that. And the more accurate they are, the wider range they are, the better you're able to do that in your operations. That's number one. And then the second one, Gary, is everybody wants to say, if something goes wrong, I want to be able to tell people that I did the right product, I did the right thing. I performed the task and a lot of our products connect with the central system in a factory recording and documenting that the torque -- the fasteners are applied correctly and that's helping drive it. So, the combination of the idea of being accurate in the moment and being able to do it with accuracy and ease on the line. And secondly, the document is helping torque go upwards. And that business grew both in profits and sales in the quarter. We like it. And as you know, we've been investing and doing it. We've been making quite a few investments, I mean, acquisitions and in expanding that business, we like that as a business going forward and it's essential in critical industries in a lot of different places. Gary Prestopino : Okay. Thank you. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : The next question is from David MacGregor with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. David MacGregor : Yes, sir. Good morning everyone. Nick Pinchuk : David, thank you. David MacGregor : Hey, good morning. I wonder if we could just -- a couple of just questions for the model. SFC order growth, I mean, you indicated last year in the third quarter, you saw mid-single-digit growth. Can you just give us some sense of what that order growth or decline might have looked like this year? And just how -- also with respect to the-- Nick Pinchuk : Go ahead, sorry. David MacGregor : So, it was flat year-over-year or it was up mid-single-digits? Nick Pinchuk : It was flat year-over-year. So, it's about the same as -- so in other words, we thought last year was a pretty good one. The problem coming out of the SFC, people slammed into the wall of uncertainty that they saw, say, sometime in like now, and they started to back away from their orders. Remember, the SFC ain't sales, it's orders. And so of course, getting a lot of orders or better than a poking eye with a sharp stick. But -- so we felt pretty good. Now, this year, we don't think there's any surprises on the horizon and people still order about the same amount. So-- David MacGregor : And Nick, when you think about the fulfillment on those orders from SFC this year and sort of the cadence or the timing of those orders, will there be anything different in terms of the pattern as they fall across 3Q and 4Q than last year? Nick Pinchuk : The difference -- the little difference is this is that we didn't push it out quite as far and so it's a little shorter period. And we've planned some reinforcing promotions in between just have belts and suspenders on this kind of thing. So, we'll see how that plays out. That's the -- in terms of tools talk, that's what we're doing. But in general, differences, David, it's all -- okay, we got the same amount of orders as last year. If people don't see the same alarming uncertainty arising in front of them theoretically, it should go better. If they -- but on the other hand, you never know until you know in that situation. David MacGregor : So, I just want to clarify, you got about the same number of orders as you did last year, but you shipped a little more in 3Q versus 4Q this year than you would have last year is what you're saying? Nick Pinchuk : No, I'm not saying that. Yes, I am saying that. But in other words, when I say the same, I mean about the same amount of orders adjusted for the time that we sold these things. So, you're saying, okay, maybe last year, we sold in a couple of weeks -- had orders out in a couple of weeks in January. This year, we didn't have that. So, when I say the same, I'm kind of rating it out over the shorter period, and that's the same. David MacGregor : Okay. And then a question for Aldo, on the Snap-on Tools gross profits up 100 basis points, you called out in your slide deck, price/cost and raw materials and RCI. You didn't mention the category mix with the stronger hand tools versus, say, diagnostics. Is that just an oversight? Or is there something that we should read into the way you've--? Aldo Pagliari : Anything to read into it. I think that the product line -- the efficiency across the board is better. Broadly speaking, the cost of steel is down, particularly in some of the cold-rolled sheet steel that we use in the Algona factory. But that's one of the key contributors. And they just are a little bit more efficient with some of the new factory arrangements. Some of that investment has resulted in slightly better efficiencies. So they're just a little bit better at delivering the demand that was in front of them. And the product mix as Nick mentioned. Yes, hand tools gives you a little bit of favorability, but they were -- it was across the board. David MacGregor : Okay. It sounds like maybe that category mix is not quite as bigger contributor this quarter as it has been in previous quarters. Is that your assessment? Nick Pinchuk : I wouldn't necessarily say that. I don't know where you get that idea. I mean the point is that there's three pieces of this, as Aldo just said. It's the category mix, the product mix. There is -- there was -- as I said, there's efficiencies in the factory that are in there, RCI in the factory and there's some material costs. So, there are three things pushing. You're talking about the 100 basis point improvement, right? Yes, there are three things. What I was talking about in terms of profitability is an indication of the effect of the pivot. So, that helped our sales. David MacGregor : Next question for me, just on fourth quarter, the Snap-on Tools segment again, you've got an easier compare on a year-over-year basis. You talked about the third quarter truck restock going on. I just -- how are you thinking about the growth puts and takes for 4Q in Snap-on Tools? Nick Pinchuk : Well, look, that's a tough call. Look, we don't give guidance. There are a lot of variables going forward, but I like our chances. I'll say, it looks -- if you're talking about the Snap-on Tools Group, the Tools Group seems to have momentum. So, if you were me and you were sitting here and saying, look, I'm confronted with uncertainty, people want to go to lower payback items. I've seen our ability to cater to that, to meet that, to match that requirement. I've seen the factories come on stream. I've seen us launch new products that are compelling and strong. So, I like where we're going on this. I believe we're going forward with momentum. I can't predict the slope of the curve. David MacGregor : Right. Okay. Last question for me. I wonder if you could just update us on franchisee attrition trends, can you just talk about what the typical experience is with growth performance when that route comes back to the operator--? Nick Pinchuk : It's been about the same. It's been about the same for some time. It moves tenth of a point from quarter-to-quarter. And the fill rate varies depending on, well, can you find people, how are you -- we don't like to lower our standards. And if people leave in a certain area, do we have people in that area, we can easily find. And that's what drives the variation from quarter-to-quarter. I think that's good. One of the good things in the quarter was we saw the number of assistant as a percent of franchisees grow some. So, I like that structural point of view. It grew maybe a number of basis points, so upwards. The percentage seems to be moving upward in this era. So, I view that as kind of a sub-rows of favorable event that when we get orders uncertainty, that's going to accrue to our benefit. David MacGregor : Right. And the repurchase of inventory from exiting franchisees, did that impact the growth number this quarter? Nick Pinchuk : There were some of that, but I wouldn't have called it a significant change year-over-year or quarter-to-quarter. There's some of it. But I -- we don't really -- we haven't seen it to be something that I would report to the world and say, that's a significant thing. you ought to consider it. It hasn't changed that much. It can change from time-to-time, but not this quarter, wasn't a big. David MacGregor : Okay. Thanks Nick. Appreciate it. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Luke Junk with Baird. Please go ahead. Luke Junk : Good morning Nick. Thanks for taking my question. Hey Aldo. Good to catch up with you too. First one for me is on the Tools Group, 3Q up versus 2Q, a great outcome. Obviously, most years, it's the opposite, as you noted. I want to focus on the execution side. Clearly, the focus on quicker payback items is the same. But just the enabling activities, what do you think were the bigger contributors? Is it the capacity expansions helping incrementally, Milwaukee especially? Can you tie it back to getting the mix of promotions right? Is there something we should be looking at the tool carts? Is it all of the above, Nick? Anything you spike out? Nick Pinchuk : It's probably some of all of that. But look, I think the thing is that we -- it's a combination of product development, to pivoting to producing some of the more popular products in the midst of a factory expansion, no easy exercise for a plant manager. And those two things kind of came together with, as Aldo said, a range of things. We had RCI up and down the corporate, both from a design point of view. So, we designed new products. In some cases, it allowed us to take advantage of material cost reductions. And so a lot of that all came together in this situation, driving the gross margin profitability 100 basis points. If you're talking about making the pivot in the sales, you're talking about pretty much getting closer to those quicker payback items and making them work and the factory being able to deliver better because we expanded the capacity. Remember, we entered this whole thing up to our eyeballs in orders, and we couldn't deliver. So, we expanded the capacity, and that's all sort of normalizing out. And the factories are able to get more in sync with the new products coming out, we're able to deliver better, and that's working. Luke Junk : Got it. And then second, if you could just double-click on what you're seeing within diagnostics, specifically, we can see the number, obviously, in RS&I, but I'm wondering about Tools Group as well. RS&I flipped from down mid-single-digit last quarter to now up low single-digit. APOLLO+ is out there right now as a newer product, is that what we're seeing the RS&I number incrementally? Does Tools Group benefit from that as well, Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Tools Group does benefit. In other words, one of the good things in the quarter is year-over-year diagnostics were relatively stronger, mainly on the launch of this APOLLO+. I'm not saying they were incandescent, but they were pretty good in this quarter. And it was kind of artificially pushed with APOLLO+, but the APOLLO+ seemed to launch pretty well. It's early days because it's just introduced at the SFC. People got to see the guys on the floor, plugging into cars, showing how our databases can be wield and it's better, gives them great advantage. So, they went to the field enthusiastic about that. So, the sale was up substantially year-over-year and the activations are up nicely in the quarter. So, at least the launch looked pretty good. You got to see how it plays out and how much legs it has. But we -- what we like about it is it's the most cost-effective way to get intelligent diagnostics. And we think that tagline has some appeal -- has considerable appeal in the marketplace. So, that works pretty well. The big -- the other thing though that I think can get lost is in a number of different ways inside the Tools Group, which bleeds into both groups in RS&I and C&I -- I mean, and Tools Group is the rise of software. Subscriptions are up substantially. The titles are down, but in general, software growth is up nicely. And I don't have to tell you that, that's a nice profitability across the corporation. So, that's another factor going on in the Tools Group. Luke Junk : Got it. Appreciate the color Nick. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey, good morning guys. Nick Pinchuk : Morning. Bret Jordan : Hey in the Tools Group, I mean, you talked about improving momentum. Is that mix in the sense that the low value or the quick payback product is gaining share? Or are you seeing sort of a sentiment change at the shop level? Because it still seems like traffic is pretty sluggish from talking to parts distributors and the collision industry is still down, is it mix? Or is the mechanic sentiment improving? Nick Pinchuk : Mechanic sentiment is not improving. The garages though -- I don't know who you're talking to, but the garages seem to be filled. The purchase of capital type equipment in the garages like collision is down, and that's -- it's kind of off the bubble a little bit, and that's seen in our equipment group. But the sentiment of the technician, remember, we're dealing with the tech in terms of Tools Group. You're not seeing that change very much. What you're seeing, though, is the Tools Group pivoting its emphasis to try to present to people attractive and buy now ideas that they don't have to finance for three years. They can just deal within 15 weeks. And so that's what we always said would work, and it has been working. So, that's what you see the comeback. And for us, I don't know if you caught the whole conversation, but for us, one of the real indicators of momentum, at least improvement and the traction that you're seeing in that pivot is the idea that the third quarter is up over the second quarter. We have seen that. And so that has to say there's some momentum in this situation. But it doesn't have to do with the attitudes getting better. Bret Jordan : Yes. The guys who sell parts to the garages to say it's pretty sluggish. I guess, although, on the corporate expense modeling, I mean, could you help us a little bit with 2025, just given the variation in that, is there -- is running Q3 to Q4 sort of flat? Is that a rate we should continue into next year? Aldo Pagliari : I'd say a little bit of hope here in my voice is that one of the reasons that we're lower this year is lower performance-based compensation expense. So, as we reset our plan objectives for 2025, usually you start the year assuming you're going to hit the target. So that means if that were the case, I'd more model 27-ish per quarter, something in that range. That's just how I would think about that, Bret. But this year, we're not growing as fast as we had expected coming into the year and therefore, that's one of the key reasons why there's performance-based compensation differences. Bret Jordan : Okay. Another quick question. I guess, election outcome is one better for you than another. If we're going to tariff imported everything, does that make the Tools business less competitive? Or how do you think about that? Nick Pinchuk : Who knows? You know what I mean, these guys -- look -- okay, you hear so many different things. We're not going to tax tips. We're not going to tax overtime. We're going to control prices. We're going to ding the supermarkets. We're going to tax unrealized capital gains. We're going to tariff the world. Welcome to the Mad Hatter's Tea Party. Nobody knows what actually is going to happen. So, you can't even make a pronouncement. Each of these could be -- we want to raise corporate tax. Each of these could be attenuating or not. It really depends on the details. I don't think you can discern anything from what these guys have been saying. Of course, if they care of everything in the world, that's probably -- it will take some adjustment for that. It will take some adjustment for sure. But maybe it helps people who sell in the markets where they produce. Sometimes that can happen over time. But boy, I tell you what, that's a torturous set of assumptions you have to make to come to any conclusion about which person would be best or would help us or hurt us. Bret Jordan : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Carolina Jolly with Gabelli. Please go ahead. Carolina Jolly : Hi, thank you for taking my question. So, it sounds like within RS&I, software, and diagnostics, the higher-margin business is doing well. But can you remind me what's kind of happening in terms of the hardware in that business? Nick Pinchuk : Say that again, please. I lost the last. You can remind me what -- remind you of what--? Carolina Jolly : What's kind of happening in the hardware part of the business, the areas that might be a little more sluggish? Nick Pinchuk : I mean -- well, look, I don't know. equipment was going gangbusters for a long time. That's under car equipment. It's like aligners and collision equipment and lifts and those kinds of things. And some of those product categories are up. Lifts happen to be up a little bit. But in general, these are capital-light expansions -- capital-light expansions in a garage. They're fairly big ticket items, and they're sold through direct and through distributors to the actual repair shop owner and manager. And what we're seeing here is a little back off an attitude. Some of it can be associated with the macro environment. Some of it could be saying, hey, I don't know, do I want to install something now and finance it at this level when the Fed is going to keep dropping interest rates by 50-point increments and maybe I'll wait a little while. So, our reports are a little bit like that, that people are saying, I need to put new stuff in because the complexity of the new vehicles need changes to manage it, just I want to wait a little bit. Now, on top of that, you would say that CDK's disruption and some of our people do say this, CDK's disruption in the quarter turned dealerships, I think they were at 40% of the dealerships turn dealership attention away from saying adding a lift or an aligner to just trying to stay at their head above water while they didn't have a computer system. So, some of that probably was in the quarter. It's hard to really document that and I don't know how much it was, but that was certainly -- that wasn't a favorable event for us that happened in the quarter. I'm trying to hang the reduction on that, but that piled on top of the uncertainty. So, that's what's happening. And we would think though that we kind of think this is shorter term than, say, the technicians' worries, a little bit more solvable. It probably gets solvable by maybe somewhat by the election and maybe somewhat by interest rates being more definitive. And the technicians, you're more talking about broad bad news for breakfast, things like, okay, two wars, the border is lousy. Everything seems to be crashing down. I'm saying we don't know what's going to happen in 15 weeks -- after 15 weeks, a little bit different. Carolina Jolly : Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Sara Verbsky, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Sara Verbsky : Thank you, Alan, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today as we review Snap-on's fourth quarter and full year results, which are detailed in our press release issued earlier this morning. We have on the call Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on's Chief Executive Officer; and Aldo Pagliari, Snap-on's Chief Financial Officer. Nick will kick off our call this morning with his perspective on our performance. Aldo will then provide a more detailed review of our financial results. After Nick provides some closing thoughts, we'll take your questions. As usual, we provided slides to supplement our discussion. These slides can be accessed under the Downloads tab in the webcast viewer as well as on our website, snapon.com, under the Investors section. These slides will be archived on our website along with the transcript of today's call. Any statements made during this call relative to management's expectations, estimates or beliefs or otherwise discuss management's or the company's outlook, plans or projections are forward-looking statements and actual results may differ materially from those made in such statements. Additional information and the factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are contained in our SEC filings. Finally, this presentation includes non-GAAP measures of financial performance, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for their GAAP counterparts. Additional information regarding these measures is included in our earnings release issued today, which can be found on our website. With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Nick Pinchuk. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Sara. Good morning, everybody. I'll start with the highlights of our fourth quarter. I'll give you my perspective on the results, on the market environment and on our progress. It was considerable. After that, and as usual, Aldo will move into a more detailed review of the financials. These are interesting times, filled with uncertainty. But Snap-on is built to prevail even in turbulence. And this isn't our first rodeo, it's our job to confront and to overcome and to proceed with confidence, confidence in the resilience of our market, confidence in the strength of our strategic and tactical advantages and confidence in the insight and energy of our consistent and capable people. And all of that echoed in the numbers. So here they are. Overall sales in the quarter were $1,198.7 million, up 0.2% both as reported and organically, returned to positive territory. Profitability was strong with gross margin of 49.7%, a gain of 140 basis points. And the OpCo OI margin was 22.1%, an increase of 50 basis points over 2023 and an all-time high for the fourth quarter. Financial services earnings of $66.7 million in the quarter were lower by $1.2 million, leading to a consolidated margin, including both OpCo and financial services at 25.5%, an improvement of 30 basis points. Our EPS for the quarter was $4.82, up $0.07 from the $4.75 recorded last year. The results show broad gains overcoming the uncertainty, another period of sequential progress, brought by record performances by both the commercial and industrial, C&I, by the commercial industrial C&I group and by Repair System Information, or the RS&I group, combined with the Tools Group successfully pivoting to match tech preferences and continuing to narrow the gap versus last year. It was an encouraging demonstration of advantage, our resilience and of capability. But first, let's speak about the markets. We believe the vehicle repair market is robust, a continuing stream of new tools and data to confront the rising complexity of the modern vehicle. The repair shops today, dealerships or independents must deal with an expanding array of challenges, multiple powertrains, EVs, plug-in hybrids, super hybrids, advanced combustion, sophisticated digital system and a wide range of autonomous operations, devices like adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, collision avoidance sensors, self-parking features, it goes on and on and on, and the list is getting longer. And technicians have to fix it all, addressing a dizzying array of procedures. It's daunting, but this is where Snap-on shines, scanning, diagnosing, guiding and fixing, enabling the techs \u2013 making \u2013 enabling the techs, making the difficult tasks easier and when combined with an aging car park that now averages 12.6 years and includes a multitude of technology generations, all needing to be fixed, driving even more complexity and requiring even more tools and more data. It represents even more opportunity. We love it. Vehicle repair has several slices. So let's start by focusing on the shops, the dealerships and the independent shops, adjusting to the complexity often requiring things like new lifting equipment to handle the increased weight of EVs, tire changes that accommodate larger wheel sizes, software suites for managing the shops, for organizing parts data into streamlined catalogue, for scheduling repairs and customer interfaces and for guiding the techs to the most sophisticated or complicated of repairs. This is where RS&I operates. It\u2019s a target-rich environment for our array of undercar and collision equipment, and it\u2019s a growing market for our software and data products. And Snap-on is well positioned with our innovative hardware, but especially with our proprietary comprehensive database, billions of insightful records, advantages that we believe \u2013 there are advantages that we believe make Snap-on the data king in vehicle repair, a position that, I think, you\u2019ll see was reinforced again by a quarter by our rising gains in that arena. Now let\u2019s shift to the techs. The individuals working in a base, under the hood, twirling the wrenches, hitting the touchscreen, applying their skill and actually making the repair. Again, this quarter, I had the opportunity to meet with a number of franchisees and their customers. And they all expressed their enthusiasm for the strength of vehicle repair and external data confirms that view, miles driven up, the car park age, hospital spending on auto \u2013 household spending on auto repair is higher, hours worked increasing and best of all, tech wages rising. I was recently in a garage and the service manager emphatically proclaimed to me that the work just keeps rolling in. We need more techs makes sense, expanding complexity means more time spent on each repair and more trained professionals needed to meet the demand and keep the shops prospering. So, it\u2019s clear the techs are in a good position. But that doesn\u2019t make them immune to the macro uncertainty around them, ongoing wars, immigration disputes, lingering inflation. And although the election\u2019s in the rear mirror and the new team may be more focused on business expansion, there\u2019s a rapid fire of new initiatives, tariff bonds, on and off again actions, impending shakeups and foreign ventures of many varieties up to now, it\u2019s hard not to be uncertain about what\u2019s up. So, the franchisees, they echo that uncertainty. And in the turbulence, the technicians continue to prefer quick payback items. Ones that make work easier and cut labor times right away, items like hand tools and mirage diagnostics, that can be paid off in shorter cycles. And they remain cool on big ticket, longer payback items like tool storage. So, the Tools Group is continuing its pivot, focusing its engineering, it\u2019s manufacturing and it\u2019s selling to match the shift in those customer preferences. So, despite some challenges in automotive \u2013 so despite some challenges, automotive repair does remain strong, and we believe we\u2019re pivoting successfully to take greater advantage. Now let\u2019s talk about critical industries, where C&I take Snap-on out of the garage, solving consequent that require precision durability, reliability and repeatability, all performed in some of the most demanding and cruelling environment, from clean rooms, to mine pits, to assembly lines, to building spacecraft, and this market, I can tell you, it\u2019s very promising. Our activity in critical industries continued rising across multiple sectors aviation, natural resources and general industry were all up nicely. The arena also represents our most significant international presence and those markets were mixed. In Europe, UK and Southern Europe up; Germany, down; in Asia-Pacific, China weaker, but gains in Japan and South Asia, despite \u2013 in Southeast Asia, despite unfavorable currency. And gains in South Korea as well. I\u2019ll add that to that situation, despite unfavorable currency. So C&I does have its challenges across the geographies and the segments, but we have made significant advantages \u2013 advancements and do see substantial opportunities for tomorrow, leveraging our advantages in product, in our brand, in our people. And you know I think when you see the results, you realize, it\u2019s working. So, both the auto repair and critical industries market remain positive, and we\u2019re ready and well-positioned to advance on those, I don\u2019t know, very wide runways. At the same time, it\u2019s clear, it\u2019s clear to us, and I hope it\u2019s clear to you that we have more potential longer runways for improvement. And as we proceed, we\u2019re fortified by our Snap-on value creation process, safety, quality, customer protection, innovation, and rapid continuous improvement or RCI, they\u2019ve never been more important, helping overcome the turbulence and authoring our resilience. Especially important is customer connection and innovation. That\u2019s our unique advantage standing next to working men and women observing each task, matching the insights gained with technology master developing new and innovative products that makes work easier. And it\u2019s a considerable strength, and our team is committed to continue to wheel it with determination. Now let\u2019s talk about the operating groups. Let\u2019s start with C&I. Fourth quarter sales of $379.2 million was an all-time high, represented an increase of $15.3 million versus last year and included $2.1 million in acquisition-related sales, $1 million in unfavorable foreign currency and our organic rise of 3.9%, driven by gains with customers in critical industries. Strong sales of our customized kits led the way, meeting the rising demand for solutions that matched specific tasks. Our specialty torque division was also a clear positive. Precision is becoming more essential every day and our broad torque offering put C&I right on target, and you can see it clearly in the numbers. OI for C&I was $63.5 million in the quarter, up $9.4 million or 17.4% from 2023. And the Group gross margin, it was up 180 basis points, and the operating margin was 16.7%. That was also up 180 basis points. C&I just keeps getting better. It's a great indication of our ability to roll out of the garage. The specialty torque business of C&I is really making strides. Torque is hot now. And Snap-on is at the party with a growing array of new products like our heavy-duty cordless torque multiplier, we call it the CTM 800 delivering torque from 160-foot pounds all the way up to 800-foot pounds, just what's needed to meet the broad challenge across mining, in oil and gas and rail and heavy duty. It's a tool that \u2013 it was a tool that was made possible by our expansion in torque. Combining the efficiencies of a Norbar gear design with the compact operation of a Snap-on power tool, authoring the wide range, making the delivery of high torque levels easy and safe, so enabling easy access to tight spots. The new units also equipped with a specially designed transducer control for applying just the precise force, a breakthrough. And it benefits from our advanced power tool cooling system that makes it much more durable. The CTM 800 torque packs a lot into one compact tool, improvement in versatility, safety, access, durability and precision. It has it all and where the tasks are critical. It's already a big hit. C&I, sales up, customized kits and precision torque, rising to new levels, all with record profitability, a high point profitability, with much more room to grow and improve. Now on to the Tools Group. Quarterly sales of $506.6 million, down but representing progress and narrowing the gap versus 2023. The progress is evident, but uncertainty still lingers. And OI for the Tools Group was $106.9 million, $4.1 million below 2023 with an operating margin of 21.1%. But despite the turbulence, we remain steadfast in supporting our van network, keeping it strong, spending on it. And that profitability was regionally acknowledged by multiple publications. The Franchise Business Review recognized us and its latest ranking for franchisee satisfaction, listing Snap-on as a top 50 franchise for the 18th consecutive year. We were named number 1 among all franchisees in Entrepreneur Magazine's 2024 list of top franchises for veterans. And Snap-on was ranked by the UK Elite Franchise Magazine as the number 1 franchise in that country, a distinction we've held for three consecutive years. Now these types of rankings confirm the fundamental strengths of our franchisees individually and of our van business in general. And I can tell you that this would not have been achieved without a continuous stream of new products developed through our strong customer connections, insight and experience transformed an innovation for a significant advantage in the rapidly changing world that's vehicle repair. One of the latest of those additions is our Milwaukee-manufactured special hex driver, specifically designed for modern vehicles equipped with advanced driver assist systems like adaptive cruise control in the base standing side-by-side with the techs making the actual repairs, we saw the difficulty in aligning the radar sensors that enable that autonomous control, enable the adaptive cruise control. And the work was difficult. Techs are removing the bumpers in the grills, dismantling the front end of the car just to reach the workplace, a very time-consuming and non-value-added exercise that risks damage to nearby \u2013 that also risks damage to nearby parts and components, all just to clear the pathway for the eventual repair. And that observation drove the design of our new [ NDDM 35, a 3.5-millimeter hex driver featuring an extra long 5.75 inch shaft, an enhanced reach that bypasses the obstructions with ease, allowing the necessary adjustments without dismantling anything. And that newly launched tool also includes our Snap-on instinct ergonomic handle design, providing superior control, making it easier to execute the work with the precision required for the very sensitive radar brackets. Our new NDDM 35 makes repairs faster, easier and more profitable and the techs have noticed it. Also in the quarter, we launched a new lineup of hand tools based on another customer connection. We're seeing the difficulty of applying leverage to the opening of a standard combination wrench, the box end of the tool was great for engaging a fastener in a crowded engine bay, just slide it right in there. But when extreme force was needed and a grip at the opposite far end was necessary, the task was extremely uncomfortable because the open end of the wrench digs into your hand. To solve the problem, our engineers designed our new XDSGM, a series that combines a box in, low profile ahead with a soft grip ratchet handle, providing the access technicians need but enabling the maximum force to be applied comfortably with the ergonomically and contoured cushion grip handle, breaking bolts free without wincing in pain or slipping off under load. The new XDSGM, I talk about it here because it's a prime example of a fast payback item, a simple but powerful innovation that makes work safer, faster and easier and the techs have loved it, making the wrench one of our million dollar hit products just since it launched a few months ago. Well, that\u2019s the Tools Group. Customer connection, producing innovative products, operations continuing to pivot meeting the customers\u2019 perseverance for fast payback items and making progress and narrowing on the gap, all while keeping the network strong in the turbulence. Now for RS&I. Volume in the fourth quarter was $456.6 million, up organically, 1.6%. Gains with both OEM dealerships and with independent shop owners for diagnostic platforms and repair information products, partially offset by lower activity in undercar equipment. RS&I operating earnings in the quarter were up of $121.4 million represented an increase of $8.1 million or 7.1%. Gross margins were up 200 basis points, and the operating margin, the operating margin was a strong 26.6%, up 150 basis points from last year from the prior year, the highest ever, a record \u2013 and the record reflects a rise in software, but it\u2019s also evidence of \u2013 the rising software is a great thing, but it\u2019s also evidence of strong and broad RCI with the great majority of RSI businesses, software and hardware, increasing margins by well over 100 basis points, Boom Shakalaka. We really love that kind of thing because it makes our profitability soar. And our Mitchell 1 specialty speaking of profitability, our Mitchell 1 specialty software division provides software to independent shops, continued incandescent success expanding its database, big data, reaching 3 billion repair records and 500 million data points, a powerful and proprietary advantage that fuels our intelligent diagnostics platform, communicating directly with vehicles, translating to trouble codes, supplying complex inductive wieldings, complex inductive models, identifying the problem and guiding technicians through the repair process, all with unprecedented speed, productivity and profitability. Now we can\u2019t talk about that without talking about the APOLLO+, the newest member of the intelligent diagnostics lineup, released in the late third quarter, and it continues to shine, surpassing previous generations and very importantly, expanding the number of software subscriptions. It\u2019s easy, fast and smart. And for this day and age, at this time, it represents a tech\u2019s quickest payback access to the power of Snap-on Intelligent Diagnostics. We expected it to be a winner, and it is. Also in the quarter, Undercar Equipment division released the new V4400 Commander wheel alignment machine. It\u2019s a game changer for shops because of its unique flexibility. A lot of shops don\u2019t have space and they don\u2019t do alignments at all. They send them out. Garages today need new equipment for matching the equipment of that kind, for matching the rising vehicle complexity. For example, alignment has never been more important. But where do you fit the new units without a costly expansion. And in many cases, the buildings are already land locked. And shop owners can\u2019t sacrifice an everyday repair base for periodic, but necessary profitable and profitable alignment procedures. So the answer is the V4400, a versatile smart and modular system. It\u2019s got an innovative design with a control center housed in a small toolbox that wirelessly connects with the two twin independent mobile towers that holds sophisticated force camera \u2013 that hold a sophisticated force camera setup. Those sections can easily be stored out of the way while not in action and can be assembled anywhere in the shop quickly, delivering an alignment capability as needed and on command regardless of the layout, whether you shop is short or wide or deeper narrow, it doesn\u2019t matter. And our proprietary software with our \u2013 based on our four-camera systems, enables a very quick setup. So therefore, setting it up is pretty easy and quick. And no shop is perfect. So our system also automatically eliminate imperfections like unlevel lifts or uneven floors, ensuring an accurate, straight as an arrow alignment, the V4400 aligner is nimble, versatile, quick and smart and it makes profitable alignment possible and many more shops. It\u2019s a great product. We keep driving to expand RS&I\u2019s position with repair shop owners and managers, offering more new products, all developed by our value creation processes, and we\u2019re confident it\u2019s a winning formula. And the Q4 results say it so. Well, that\u2019s the quarter. Sales up, 0.2% back to level. OpCo operating margin of 22.1%, up 50 basis points, a new all-time high for the fourth quarter. The Tools Group down, but narrowing the gap. The pivot is working. RS&I operating margin 26.6%, up 150 basis points, another profit high for an already high-margin group. C&I operating margins up \u2013 operating earnings, up 17.4%; operating margin, 16.7%, up 180 basis points, also at a high resilience, balance, advantage and results. It was an encouraging quarter. Now I'll turn the call over to Aldo. Aldo? Aldo Pagliari : Thanks, Nick. Our consolidated operating results for the fourth quarter are summarized on Slide 6. Net sales of $1,198.7 million in the quarter were slightly above the $1,196.6 million reported last year, reflecting an organic sales increase of $2 million. Continued strength in sales to customers in critical industries as well as gains with repair shop owners and managers, offset the marginally lower sales of our franchise van network. Consolidated gross margin improved 140 basis points to 49.7% from 48.3% last year, reflecting increased sales and higher gross margin businesses as well as benefits from the company's RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales rose 90 basis points to 27.6% from 26.7% in 2023, primarily due to increased corporate and other operating costs. Operating earnings before financial services of $265.2 million in the quarter compared to $257.9 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, operating margin before financial services of 22.1% represented an improvement of 50 basis points from the 21.6% reported last year. Financial services revenue of $100.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $97.2 million last year, while operating earnings of $66.7 million compared to $67.9 million in 2023. Consolidated operating earnings of $331.9 million compared to $325.8 million last year. As a percentage of revenues, the operating earnings margin increased 30 basis points to 25.5% in 2024. Our fourth quarter effective income tax rate of 22.5% compared to 21.4% last year. Net earnings of $258.1 million compared to $255.3 million in 2023 and net earnings per diluted share of $4.82 in the quarter, compared to $4.75 per diluted share last year. Now let's turn to our segment results for the quarter. Starting with C&I on Slide 7. Sales of $379.2 million compared to $363.9 million last year, reflecting a 3.9% organic sales gain and $2.1 million of acquisition-related sales, partially offset by $1 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic improvement is largely due to gain in sales to customers serving critical industries, including a high single-digit increase in specialty torque. With respect to critical industries, in addition to higher torque product sales, activities in aviation and general industries were encouraging during the period. Gross margin improved 180 basis points to 41% in the fourth quarter from 39.2% in 2023. This is largely due to increased sales volumes and higher gross margin, critical industry sectors and savings from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales of 24.3% in the quarter was unchanged from last year. Operating earnings for the C&I segment of $63.5 million compared to $54.1 million last year. The operating margin improved 180 basis points to 16.7% from 14.9% in 2023. Turning now to Slide 8. Sales in the Snap-on Tools Group of $506.6 million compared to $513.3 million a year ago, reflecting a 1.4% organic sales decline and $600,000 of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic decrease reflects a low single-digit decline in the United States business, partially offset by a mid-single-digit gain in our international operations. Again, this quarter, we believe that continued attenuation and a relatively modest year-over-year sales decline in the U.S. mobile network favorably demonstrates the resilience of this business given the still uncertain environment. Gross margin declined 60 basis points to 44.6% in the quarter from 45.2% last year, mostly due to the decreased volumes and the effects of increased sales of lower gross margin products. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 10 basis points to 23.5% in the quarter from 23.6% in 2023. Operating earnings for the Snap-on Tools Group of $106.9 million compared to $111 million last year. The operating margin of 21.1% compared to 21.6% in 2023. Turning to the RS&I Group shown on Slide 9. Sales of $456.6 million compared to $450.8 million in 2023, reflecting a 1.6% organic sales increase, partially offset by $1.5 million of unfavorable foreign currency translation. The organic gain includes a mid-single-digit increase in activity with OEM dealerships, and a low single-digit gain in sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers. The latter aided by the introduction of our new APOLLO+ handheld diagnostic platform. These gains more than offset a low single-digit decline in sales of undercar equipment. Gross margin improved 200 basis points to 47% from 45% last year, primarily reflecting increased sales of higher gross margin products, including a more favorable mix of software and benefits from RCI initiatives. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 50 basis points to 20.4% from 19.9% in 2023, largely due to increased personnel and other costs. Operating earnings for the RS&I Group of $121.4 million compared to $113.3 million last year. The operating margin improved 150 basis points to 26.6% from the 25.1% reported last year. Now turning to Slide 10. Revenue from financial services increased $3.3 million, or 3.4% to $100.5 million from $97.2 million last year. Financial services operating earnings of $66.7 million compared to $67.9 million in 2023. Financial services expenses were up $4.5 million from 2023 levels, including $4.4 million of higher provisions for credit losses. As a percentage of the average services portfolio, the financial services portfolio expenses were 1.3% in the quarter as compared to 1.2% last year. In the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2023, the respective average yields on finance receivables were 17.7% and 17.8%, while the average yields on contract receivables were 9.1% and 8.9%, respectively. Total loan originations of $285.1 million in the fourth quarter represented a decrease of $18 million or 5.9% from 2023 levels, including a 5.8% decline in extended credit originations. The decrease in extended credit originations mostly reflects lower sales of big ticket longer payback items. Moving to Slide 11. Our year-end balance sheet includes approximately $2.5 billion of gross financing receivables with $2.2 billion coming from our U.S. operation. For extended credit or finance receivables, the U.S. 60 day plus delinquency rate of 2% is up 20 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2023. Trailing 12 month net losses for the overall extended credit portfolio of $66.3 million represented a 3.32% of outstandings at year end. While delinquencies and net losses have been trending upward, we believe that these portfolio performance metrics remain relatively balanced considering the current environment. Now turning to Slide 12. For the quarter, cash increased by $47.2 million as compared to an increase of $42.2 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Cash provided by operating activities of $293.5 million in the quarter represented 111% of net earnings. Net cash used by investing activities of $40.2 million mostly reflected net additions to finance receivables of $26.2 million and capital expenditures of $18.1 million. Net cash used by financing activities of $201.5 million included cash dividends of $112.3 million and the repurchase of 315,000 shares of common stock for $112.5 million under our existing share repurchase programs. As of year-end we had remaining availability to repurchase up to an additional $429.4 million of common stock under our existing authorizations. Turning to Slide 13. Trade and other accounts receivable increased $24.3 million from 2023 year end. Days sales outstanding of 62 days compared to 60 days at year end 2023. Inventories decreased $62.5 million from 2023 year end and on a trailing 12 month basis inventory turns of 2.4% compared to 2.3% at year-end 2023. Our year-end cash position of $1,360.5 billion compared to $1,001.5 billion at the end of 2023. In addition to our existing cash and expected cash flow from operations, we have more than $900 million available under our credit facilities and there were no amounts borrowed or outstanding under the credit facility during the year, nor was any commercial paper issued or outstanding in the year. That concludes my remarks on our fourth quarter performance. I\u2019ll now briefly review a few outlook items for 2025. With respect to corporate cost, we currently believe that the expenses in each quarter of 2025 will be relatively in line with those incurred in the fourth quarter of 2024 or about $27 million per quarter. Additionally, during 2025 we expect to incur approximately $6 million pre-tax per quarter of increased non-service pension costs largely due to higher amortization of actuarial losses. These non-cash costs will be recorded below operating earnings as part of other income and expense net on our statement of earnings. We expect that capital expenditures will approximate $100 million and we currently anticipate that our full year 2025 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 22% to 23%. Finally, in 2025 our fiscal year will contain 53 weeks of operating results with the additional week occurring at the end of the fourth quarter. This occurs every five or six years and historically it has not had a significant effect on our full year or fourth quarter total revenues or net earnings. I\u2019ll now call \u2013 call back over to Nick for his closing thoughts. Nick? Nick Pinchuk : Thanks, Aldo. Well, our fourth quarter progress against uncertainty. The markets remained robust, repair spending up, the number of techs up, wages up, car park aging and the vehicle complexity rising, but the uncertainty remains created by the unpredictable macro environment. But we did make progress against the wind. Resilience was on display in the Tools Group, the pivot succeeding and the gap shrinking. And the balance and breadth of our operations was evident in the performance of C&I and RS&I, both turning in solid quarters with gangbusters profitability, resilience, balance and progress written across the results. The Tools Group. Organic sales down 1.4%, but making continuing progress and maintaining the strength of the network. C&I sales up 3.9% organically. OI margins of 16.7%, up 180 basis points at another high, significant sales and profit gains in custom kits and precision torque, confirming that we can roll out the Snap-on brand out of the garage successfully and very profitably. And finally, RS&I, sales up 1.6%. OI margins of 26.6%, a rise of 150 basis points, representing another record, all driven by the promising and powerful quarters of software and committed RCI. It all came together for sales of $1,198.7 million, an increase of 0.2%, return to positive territory. The overall gross margin was up 140 basis points to 49.7% and the OI margin was 22.1%, up 50 basis points, yet another record. We are encouraged by the quarter and by our prospects going forward. Notwithstanding continuing uncertainty. We believe our markets will remain resilient and robust, reflecting the essential nature of the critical tasks that define them. We believe we've not only maintained, but have expanded our considerable advantages in product and brand and in people, even as we proceeded through the turbulence. We believe our Snap-on Value Creation Processes do deliver value every day, day-in and day-out. We believe our capable team really is a difference maker, battle tested, enabled to wheel advantage to consistently create positive outcomes, overcoming obstacles. It's happened over and over, and we have all been witnesses. And we believe that all these positives will keep our enterprise moving forward, extending and continuing its positive trajectory throughout 2025 and for many years beyond. Before I turn the call over to the operator, I'm going to speak directly to our franchisees and associates. I know many of you are listening. I've spoken today on the special nature of our enterprise, resilient, capable, determined, wringing progress from challenge, you are the principal authors of all that. For your success in moving our company forward, prevailing in turbulence and proceeding with confidence, you have my congratulations. For the capability and scale you marshal every day, on behalf of our team, you have my admiration. And for your unwavering dedication too and strong belief in the future of our corporation, you have my thanks. Now, I'll turn the call over to the operator. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Scott Stember of Roth MKM. Please go ahead. Scott Stember : Good morning guys and thanks for taking my question. Nick Pinchuk : Hi Scott. Scott Stember : Talking about tools. I'm just trying to flesh out how close we are to, I guess, turning positive. Can you maybe talk about the confidence at the shop level. I know you talked about it, I guess, still being high, but the \u2013 I guess, their confidence high, but cash poor. Has that scenario actually gone backwards at all. And the second part of that... Nick Pinchuk : I don't think it's going back. Look, I think it's like this. I was just a \u2013 I was in a shop a couple of weeks ago and talked to some franchisees the other day and talked to some other techs and other parts of the country and talked to franchisees all over the country. And it's sort of like this. I think people are pretty confident that vehicle repair is robust because of all the things I went through on my, the complexity, you see the Bureau Labor data, it's pretty much everybody is talking about we need more techs, they got a lot of work. I can't do it \u2013 try getting your car repair and you'll find out what I mean. And then you address the uncertainty. And one thought might have been, I think, is that when the election resolved itself, and things went forward, maybe the, I guess, stated positive view of the current team toward business and particularly towards the people who work. I mean they said stuff like the other day about its technical education month and we will find alternate paths to higher education that will provide real skills for real careers. And we will make technology work for Americans, not Americans work for technology, stuff like that. So those are music to the ears of the techs. But on the other hand, they see all these initiatives. And every day you get up, and you've got to read the paper on what's going on in Washington, you hear words like Panama and Greenland and Gaza and all this stuff. And as I said in the remarks, nobody knows what's up. So you kind of have this idea they're like, you know what it is, it's like being on Space Mountain at Disney World. You could get on Space Mountain, you get in a car and you're in the dark and a car's going left and right, left and right, turns, you don't know where you're going, but you know you're pretty confident that you're going to get to the right place at the bottom. And so that's where they are now. They're kind of waiting to see what's going to happen. So I think the only change between last time, they're still uncertain. They're still looking at short payback items. But I would think people often asking, what do you think would have to happen to make them positive? I think if things calm down in Washington, and there will be more predictable activity and more quarters of advancement that didn't change all the time. And then I think that would be a big change. So that's where I see them now. They're talking about this up to you. We like them and it doesn't really \u2013 I don't know where they're going. Scott Stember : Got it. And as far as Snap-on and the actual pivoting, are you guys fully pivoted in making the product that you want to do? Nick Pinchuk : We wanted to. But I would say, look, I was encouraged by the 1.4. If you look at each year it was something like we came out of the box down 7, then we were 7.7 down, then we're at 3.7 down and now we're 1.4 down organically. And so I think that's a pretty positive indication. You could have said, well, it might have been better or worse, I never \u2013 I'm pretty confident of our direction because we keep pivoting. We keep getting better at things. But I can't tell you the slope of the curve. But I do\u2026 Scott Stember : Got it. Nick Pinchuk : [Indiscernible] it's working. Scott Stember : Great. And then just last question on C&I and RS&I. Could you tell us what the external sales were for each on an organic basis? Nick Pinchuk : External sales, I think you could say the external sales for RS&I was closer to what it is. C&I external sales were somewhere in the range of half of what that was something like that, that was still kind of in the same range, but around a little bit less than that. That's how it is because it was the idea about C&I, some of the stuff they produce, expect some of the tool stuff, the torque stuff goes through the Tools Group. Scott Stember : Oh, got you. Okay. Great. All right. That's all I have for now. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sherif El-Sabbahy [ph] of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. Nick Pinchuk : Hi, Sherif. Unidentified Analyst : I was just wondering if you could add a bit more color on the decline in originations. Is that mostly a function of product mix? Are you seeing customers finance less of the purchases overall? Nick Pinchuk : Mostly tool storage down, that was it. I mean and so remember, that's part of the pivot, Sherif. In other words, the people are less willing. I think this is a predictable outcome all we've been saying about customer preference. Part of it is they want quick paybacks. In other words, they want stuff that will work right away, but also the stuff is when they buy the stuff off the van on what we would call revolving accounts, they pay it off in 15 weeks or they pay in cash or if they want. And so that tends to be \u2013 so they spend more of their money on those shorter items that they liquidate the obligation in 15 weeks, and they don't get involved in like a three-year deal. And that is the origination. The other factor is, and you put your finger on, it was very sage of you is that the APOLLO+ is at the lower end of the \u2013 remember, I said it was the quickest payback, which means lowest cost access to full intelligent diagnostics and more of that would be handled on an RA than, say, like a ZEUS, which is much more expensive like the top of the line. So the diagnostic line, the new product we introduced could be \u2013 some portion of that could be handled not on EC. So those are all contributing. But I will point out to you though, as well as I do on all these calls, is originations are associated with sales off the van, not sales to the van. So they don't necessarily follow in the same time frame. We sell a box to a van, it doesn't necessarily sell off right away. Sometimes the guy shops it for a while to people. So it's an imprecise science. But what you're seeing most of all, to answer quickly, that 5.9% reduction in originations in total, I believe that was the number, is principally driven by lower tool storage sales. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Luke Junk of Baird. Please go ahead. Luke Junk : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Nick Pinchuk : Good morning, Luke. Luke Junk : Nick, I'm hoping you could double-click on the strength that you're seeing in specialty torque right now and just at a high level, I mean, it seems like that should benefit multiple areas across both critical industries and some of the growing opportunities within auto repair. And maybe, Nick, any thoughts around investment there, quickly, I think, an organic focus area. But could we see any additional M&A. It seems like Mountz has been a pretty good dealer. Nick Pinchuk : That's certainly a place where we've looked at we have. Mountz last year, which we acquired, I think, in the fourth quarter last year was a torque related, a torque control power tool company. So it gave us \u2013 it was some of the technology that drove that CTM 800 to fruition. One of the things we're doing, I think we would look to invest in there. And so that would be one of our principal quarters for exploration of things to invest because we really believe in that. The other thing we're investing in a kind of an organic way is to try to bring the operations together to create more combinations like the CTM 800 is a compendium of the technologies we had in the gears of Norbar and that drives the basically front end of the power tools and Mountz acquisitions and some of the systems we have in terms of torque control from Mountz and cooling that we had in power tools. And that came together and created a superior tool that we believe has no equal. So that \u2013 so you're going to see us look at acquisitions, but you're also going to see us trying to invest some money and smashing those businesses, not smashing but trying to make sure there's a good irrigation of technologies, related technologies between those businesses because we believe in some total they are quite powerful. Luke Junk : Good stuff. And then for my follow-up, and I know this is hard to dial in precisely. But Nick, any thoughts on just the continued headwinds in big ticket right here and the origination trend, I should say. And just as we think about the potential growth of the Tools Group this year, how much if any big ticket would you need if you were going to grow in line with the longer term 4% to 5% and relative to the pivot to small ticket just \u2013 any way to kind of calibrate how much is left there to go after. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Look, I think there's a lot left in small ticket. It's a question of getting things that attract people. In other words, the idea behind the pivot is first and foremost, I think is widening and bringing out more like attractive new products, what I call \u2013 we call [indiscernible] product, hit products in the small ticket arena, therefore getting the customer excited about things, he will actually pull the trigger on in this environment. That's really what's going on here. That's what we call pivot. It includes manufacturing and design and manufacturing and, of course, marketing to dress it all up in a promotion. But \u2013 so you can keep doing that. And we believe that brings us \u2013 that keeps us on an upward trend. Of course, if you're having people shy away from big ticket items; you're not firing completely on all cylinders. So it's hard for me to answer that trajectory. I think with pivoting, we keep going positive because we know how to improve. We probably don't fire on all cylinders, so people get a little more comfortable, but I don't think it's a matter of if we can keep \u2013 I think there's a what I would call almost inexhaustible upward trend in the pivot. It's just we'd like to have all our products because our tool storage products are thoughtful. It's just that, so if we can get them engaged we've got to be even more stuff and people would buy even more. So it's a hard thing to answer. But I do think even if we didn't get the uncertainty broken, we believe we could keep going. If the uncertainty breaks then there would be a more normalization. I'm not saying we can't get back to normal without breaking the uncertainty, but it will take longer, that's all. Luke Junk : Got it. Thanks Nick. Nick Pinchuk : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan : Hey. Good morning, guys. Nick Pinchuk : Hey Bret. Bret Jordan : Let me throw the tariff question out there for you. And I guess sort of relative positioning around what may or may not happen here. Your domestic mix versus your competitors, how do you see yourself positioned? And what's the impact? Nick Pinchuk : Well, you tell me how the tariff is going to play out, and I'll tell you what the impact is going... Bret Jordan : That's why I was looking for the answer too. Nick Pinchuk : That's what I mean. I don't know. I mean, but look, I think \u2013 let me state this. We certainly are more insulated from import \u2013 tariffs on imports than most. So tariffs \u2013 why tariffs grow on a lot of imported sources than I think we make out pretty well because I like our chances in that situation. That doesn't mean we're totally immune to it. We do have tariff costs right now. We've been eating them for years. We have \u2013 we import some stuff that attracts tariffs. But generally, we make in the markets where we sell and a huge portion of our product line is made in the United States are in pretty good shape. If you're talking about tariffs, retaliatory tariffs, who knows? It's \u2013 you never know what people are going to do. But I think this isn't our first rodeo, as I said on my call, I mean you know our ways around that. When we saw the stuff come up we were already thinking about ways to kind of minimize and optimize in that situation and there are paths to do that. So we're not shaking in our boots over the whole thing. Bret Jordan : And then on the relative strength of international tools versus U.S., I mean, sort of what do you attribute that to? Is there less competition? There's no Harbor Freight or Matco in those markets. So it's a different competitive landscape or what you see there? Nick Pinchuk : Who? What did you say? Who did you say? Bret Jordan : Matco, Harbor Freight, Mac people who are selling tools in the U.S. market that are not internationally. Nick Pinchuk : No, look, I don't think \u2013 I don't think that's the situation. I don't think that \u2013 nobody really says that. That's not the situation in the U.S. The U.S. is simply associated. If you think about the uncertainties that are in the U.S., the border, the idea now you do have the two wars and then have it other environments. Australia, I think thinks of itself as being insulated from all that. But then you have the election, you have what I call the rapid fire ideas out of Washington, you have the rise in prices. So I think the uncertainty things kind of inflicts the U.S. to a greater extent than anything else. Our UK business seems to be more solid. And a lot of this stuff, Bret, is where you come from. So the international businesses, I think if you go back and look at it, they have been suffering for a while. Now they've come back somewhat. So you're seeing some of that snap back there in that situation. I don't think the competitive environment changes that much really in either place because you have other competitors that are national competitors. For example, if you're in Australia, you've got people there that people prefer and technicians don't own their own tools as to quite the same extent as they do here. You have couple all that kind of stuff. So I don't think there's much \u2013 the competition isn't the variance between the organizations \u2013 between the locations. Bret Jordan : All right. Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David MacGregor of Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is Joe Nolan [ph] on for David. Nick Pinchuk : Joe Nolan. Okay. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, guest appearance. I was just going to start. What was that? Nick Pinchuk : Welcome to the party. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Appreciated. So first, just a strong quarter for the critical industries and for the torque tools business, you've invested in some capacity there. So I assume you're shipping against some backlog orders. I was just wondering what you're seeing in terms of order activity? And if you\u2019re. Nick Pinchuk : The order activity is pretty good. I mean, we do have some backlog there like always, it is \u2013 it had been higher before. It built up and when we put on a new expansion that we kind of we didn't liquidate the backlog, but we more normalize it. So, I wouldn't call it a buildup of backlog, but the backlog has been pretty solid. So, I'm pretty positive about the critical industries. And the thing about it is that it seems like we have increasing demand all the time because the idea of complex and customized kitting seems to have high demand and growing everybody in their brother seems to want to have a set that matches the particular problem that they have, and we can put them right on target. And we may be the only person who really does that very effectively, plus it includes a whole bunch of Snap-on tools, which creates a whole other cache to the combined kit. So we love that business. It seems that it was up substantially in the quarter. I'm not going to give you the number, but I can tell you that business went bananas in the quarter. So I feel pretty good about it, and it's very profitable. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Sounds great. And I know you guys don't provide guidance, but just thinking about that business' margins into 2025, just any of the moving parts there, obviously, the strength in critical industries is a benefit for margins. So just anything more you can provide? Nick Pinchuk : All I can tell you is what I tried to make in this quarter was we had two things. We basically had the Tools Group returning \u2013 pivoting and narrowing the gap. Of course, it was down some. \u2013 much more of a sliver than it had been down. But the results, 22.1%, up 50 basis points. And if you really looked at last year's number, you would see that there might have been some boost, some little help there from some like special items like legal settlements and stuff like that in the quarter so it was up tremendously and nicely, and that was brought by the other two groups really having wilds of quarters profitability-wise for sure. And that profitability was rooted in the idea that there are more profitable divisions in the case of RS&I, the software area was going gangbusters and in the C&I group, the custom tools, the critical industries, those customized kit gangbusters and though, on top of it, like I said in RCI and this was probably missed in my comment, across RS&I, a great majority of the businesses, even the hardware businesses were up over 100 basis points, and that was RCI, rapid continuous improvement. So going forward, what you have is good runway for those profitable businesses and then seemingly good momentum of RCI across the corporation. I hope nobody misses that in this quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Got it. That's great. And then just quickly on the Tools Group. Apologies if I missed this, but did you talk about sell-in versus sell-through in the quarter? Nick Pinchuk : I did not. It's about the same. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. All right, great. Thanks. I'll pass it on. Nick Pinchuk : Sure. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sara Verbsky for any closing remarks. Sara Verbsky : Thank you all for joining us today. A replay of this call will be available shortly on snapon.com. As always, we appreciate your interest in Snap-on. Good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
